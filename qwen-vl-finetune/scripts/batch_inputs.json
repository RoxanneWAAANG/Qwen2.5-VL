the samples were collected from pigs in provinces in north vietnam during 2011– <dig> total prrsv rna was extracted using trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instruction. reverse transcription was performed using superscript™ iii first-strand synthesis supermix . orf <dig> sequences were amplified by rt-pcr using previously described primers <cit> . pcr products were directly sequenced . the raw sequences were assembled and aligned using bioeditv <dig> . <dig> <cit> against the corresponding orf <dig> sequences from genbank to construct the complete orf <dig> sequence. additional <dig> vietnamese orf <dig> reference sequences from field isolates collected from genbank were also used in this study . phylogenetic analysis and classification in order to identify the lineage classifications for all the prrsv strains circulating in vietnam, an orf5-based phylogeny was reconstructed using a restricted parameter substitution model <cit> with iq-tree software <cit> . the total data set in this study contained <dig> vietnamese orf <dig> gene sequences and <dig> worldwide orf <dig> reference sequences for lineages <dig> to <dig> <cit> . bootstrap values were obtained using the ultrafast bootstrap approximation method with <dig> replicates <cit> . bayesian phylogenetic inference of orf <dig> from vietnamese strains the coalescent-based bayesian markov chain monte carlo method was used to investigate the phylogenetic relationship among vietnamese prrsv strains based on orf <dig> sequences. the srd <dig> codon-based model was used as a nucleotide substitution model <cit> and combined with <dig> molecular clock models and <dig> demographic coalescent tree models . in each analysis, the mcmc chain was performed using beast v <dig> . <dig> software <cit> . five independent runs were done to verify the distribution in the mcmc run. the corresponding output log files were combined by logcombiner before subsequently analyzing via tracer v <dig> to select the best-fit data models for molecular clock and coalescent tree priors using akaike’s information criterion analysis with <dig> replicates <cit> . a bayesian phylogenetic tree was selected from combined trees files from the above chosen best-fit models using treeannotator in beast package. glycosylation site prediction glycosylation sites in the vietnamese prrsv strains were predicted using the netnglyc server web utility . adefault threshold of <dig> was used to identify potential n-glycosylation sites, followed by additional thresholds of <dig> and <dig> to identify the potential n-glycosylation sites with higher confidence levels. selective pressure gp <dig> sites undergoing positive selection were inferred using <dig> algorithms: slac, fel, ifel, fubar, and meme . sites undergoing negative selection were predicted using <dig> algorithms: slac, fel, ifel, and fubar. to identify other sites undergoing potential selective pressure, sites were analyzed for either diversifying or purifying selection at p-value ≤ <dig> using slac, fel, ifel, and meme methods, or for posterior probability ≥ 90% using the fubar method. RESULTS to investigate the evolution of vietnamese prrsv strains, we analyzed the time scale phylogenetic tree, the genetic diversity among strains, the time of most common ancestor of prrsv strains in vietnam as well as the change of n-glycosylation pattern during this time. phylogenetic analysis of the orf <dig> sequence based on the constructed phylogenetic tree, the major prrsv strains isolated in vietnam could be classified into sub-lineage <dig> , which is closely related to the highly pathogenic prrsv strains recently isolated in china, including jxa <dig> and sx <dig> <cit> . the remaining strains were classified into sub-lineage <dig> , which contains vr-2332-related strains <cit> . further analysis based on bayesian inference showed that hp-prrsvs in vietnam can be divided into two main sub-groups . interestingly, most of the prrsv strains collected in north vietnam during 2013– <dig> belonged to sub-group ii . under the best-fit model selected, the substitution rate in the orf <dig> gene of the vietnamese prrsv strains was about <dig> × 10− <dig> intervals: <dig> × 10−3– <dig> × 10−3). in addition, the geometric mean time to the most recent common ancestor of the hp-prrsv isolated in vietnam was approximately 13 years ago and the tmrca of sub-lineage <dig> prrsv strains was more than 16 years ago .fig. <dig> phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequence of the orf <dig> gene of <dig> prrsv strains isolated in vietnam during 2007– <dig> the phylogenetic tree, generated via the mcmc method using beast v <dig> . <dig> software, identified three different groups. the inserted histogram illustrates pairwise sequence comparisons of vietnamese prrsv type <dig> strains. three distinct nucleotide identity distribution peaks are shown. the time-scale represented in the tree is indicated by the scale bar genetic diversity of the vietnamese prrsv strains during 2007–2015 genetic comparison of the orf <dig> gene of the vietnamese prrsv strains collected from <dig> to <dig> showed that 144vietnamese prrsv strains in this study shared 81–100% nucleotide identity . furthermore, the similarity among the orf <dig> sequences presented in the same year was about <dig> –100%. especially in <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> when the appearance of prrsv sub-lineage <dig> strains was recorded, differences among nucleotide sequences was up to <dig> % while in the remaining years, it was just about 2%. further analysis showed that the similarity among vietnamese hp-prrsv strains was of <dig> –100% while the difference among sub-lineage <dig> strains was up to <dig> %.table <dig> nucleotide and deduced amino acid identities among <dig> vietnamese prrsv strains the deduced amino acid sequence encoded by the orf <dig> gene of <dig> vietnamese prrsv strains shared 82–100% identity. for each sub-lineage group, the amino acid identity was 90–100% and <dig> –100% for hp-prrsv and sub-lineage <dig> , respectively . glycosylation site variants a total of <dig> potential n-glycosylation sites were found for the vietnamese prrsv strains isolated in vietnam during the 2007– <dig> period. the identified positions and the total numbers of n-glycosylation sites were diverse. notably, prrsv strains isolated during the outbreaks in <dig> had the greatest variation in n-glycosylation patterns, followed by those from the outbreaks in <dig> which had <dig> and <dig> glycotypes . glycosylation site variations were located between amino acids <dig> and <dig> while n <dig> and <dig> seemed to be conserved in most of the vietnamese strains, presenting in <dig> % and 100% of strains, respectively. furthermore, n <dig> was predicted as a glycosylation site with higher potential . an n-glycosylation pattern of n <dig> n <dig> n <dig> and n <dig> seems to be the main glycotype in vietnamese prrsv strains, accounting for nearly 61%. interestingly, we observed differences in the frequencies of n-glycosylation positions between sub-lineage <dig> strains and sub-lineage <dig> strains. to be specific, n <dig> n <dig> n <dig> n <dig> and n <dig> were identified as potential n-glycosylation sites in sub-lineage <dig> , accounting for <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> and <dig> % of strains, respectively, whereas only n <dig> n <dig> and n <dig> were predicted as in sub-lineage <dig> accounting for <dig> , <dig> , and <dig> % of strains, respectively . furthermore, only two vietnamese prrsv sub-lineage <dig> strains had similar n-glycosylation patterns as the vaccine strain vr <dig> while the other strains lacked the potential n-glycosylation site at n <dig> on the other hand, <dig> vietnamese hp-prrsv strains had the same n-glycosylation pattern as the jxa <dig> vaccine strains.table <dig> glycosylation

selective pressure in gp5 to identify positions under selective pressure, slac, fel, ifel, meme, and fubar methods were implemented separately. since each method utilizes a different algorithm for predicting sites under positive or negative selection, for our study, we considered sites to be undergoing diversifying selection if so predicted by all <dig> of the methods, and to be undergoing purifying selection if predicted by <dig> of the methods. consequently, we identified <dig> positions as potentially undergoing positive selection . most of the positive selection sites were located in ecto-domain <dig> , while only <dig> site undergoing diversifying selection was found in each ecto-domain <dig> and signal domain .fig. <dig> amino acids under selective pressure. upper rectangles indicate the ecto-domain <dig> ecto-domain <dig> and endo-domain, whereas lower rectangles indicate the signal peptide, trans-membrane <dig> and trans-membrane <dig> regions. the red lines and blue lines indicate sites under significant positive and negative selection, respectively. dn-ds represents the normalized dn–ds value according to the fel method a different pattern was observed for the negative selection sites. in our study, <dig> sites were predicted to be undergoing negative selection . purifying selection sites were mainly located in the endo-domain . furthermore, negative selection sites were detected in trans-membrane <dig> trans-membrane <dig> and ecto-domain <dig> . discussion since first identified in the late 1980s, prrsv has become the most significant porcine reproductive pathogen. the orf <dig> gene is the most diverse gene not only in prrsv, but also in other arteriviruses, and has been an important target for investigations on the genetic characterization and evolution of prrsv worldwide <cit> . in this study, most of the prrsv strains isolated in vietnam during 2007– <dig> belonged to sub-lineage <dig> , except for <dig> strains that belonged to sub-lineage <dig> . this result is consistent with that of previous reports, indicating that most of the prrsv strains isolated in vietnam are close related to jxa <dig> <cit> . in fact, attenuated vaccine strains belonging to sub-lineage <dig> , such as vr <dig> and bsl-ps, have been approved for use in vietnam. furthermore, although hp-prrsv strains are the main agents of pprs in countries around vietnam, such as china and others in south east asia, strains from other type <dig> prrsv lineages such as lineages <dig> <dig> and <dig> have also circulated <cit> . therefore, these data suggest that the appearance of sub-lineage <dig> in vietnam may be due to vaccine descendants or commercial activities. in addition, our study indicates that the hp-prrsv strains circulating during 2013– <dig> were distantly related to the other hp-prrsv strains. this may have resulted from the introduction of new prrsv strains into vietnam. however, the limited number of vietnamese prrsv orf <dig> sequences used in this study may not exactly reflect the genetic diversity of prrsvs in vietnam. although, the prrsv strains circulating in vietnam clustered within sub-lineage <dig> and <dig> , their percentages of intra-sub-lineage genetic diversity were <dig> –100% and <dig> –100%, respectively. the intra-sub-lineage genetic diversity in our study was higher than in a previous study <cit> . this result might be due to the high substitution rate detected in the orf <dig> gene. in addition, the substitution rate in the orf <dig> gene of the vietnamese strains, which was <dig> × 10− <dig> was slightly faster than the substitution rates observed in common type ii prrsv strains <cit> this supports our hypothesis. according to our analysis, the tmrca of sub-lineage <dig> strains was approximately 17 years ago, which is supported by serological evidence for anti-prrsv antibodies in vietnam during this time. the tmrca of sub-lineage <dig> strains was estimated to have occurred in <dig> which is similar to the tmrca of the hp-prrsv from china <cit> . it is reported that the n-glycosylation positions in gp <dig> affect the adaptation of prrsv to the host’s immune response and infectivity <cit> . in our study, <dig> potential n-glycotypes were observed for the gp <dig> protein of the vietnamese prrsv strains isolated between <dig> and <dig> . furthermore, our investigation revealed diversity in the putative n-glycosylation site amino acid positions and quantity . however, the n-glycotype diversity identified in the vietnamese prrsv strains was less than that recorded for the prrsv strains from eastern canada isolated between <dig> and <dig> <cit> . another report shows that the prrsv strains isolated in china from <dig> to <dig> have the same n-glycosylation sites as the vietnamese strains <cit> . in all positions, the n <dig> site was predicted at a high confidence level and seemed to be conserved. these results are consistent with the important role of this residue in infectivity <cit> . the n <dig> glycosylation site has also been demonstrated to affect the growth kinetics of prrsv <cit> , and is highly conserved in type <dig> prrsv from many countries <cit> . on the other hand, n-glycosylation sites seem to vary at positions 32– <dig> . these sites are located within the hyper-variable region that has been previously described <cit> . it is believed that the variations in n-glycosylation in this region may influence viral neutralization <cit> . however, not all potential glycosylation sites in this region are glycosylated. li et al. <cit> suggested that only <dig> or <dig> glycosylation sites in this region are utilized and that their exact positions are still unknown. another notable result of this study was the distribution of diversity and purified selection positions throughout the gp <dig> of vietnamese prrsv strains. nguyen et al. <cit> can not conclude the role of selected position in typical prrsv and hp-prrsv. in this study, our analysis of sites under selective pressure indicated that most of the sites undergoing positive selection are located in ecto-domain <dig> which contains the linear epitope, and an additional positive selection site is also predicted in ecto-domain <dig> . our results are generally consistent with those of previous studies, with the exception of the positive selection site predicted in the signal peptide <cit> . a previous study demonstrated that site-directed mutagenesis of the amino acid residues at <dig> and <dig> can enhance prrsv evasion of neutral antibodies in vitro <cit> . this supports the results from our current study. in addition, the potential n-glycosylation sites at the n <dig> n <dig> and n <dig> have been previously identified as undergoing positive selection in the hp-prrsv strains recently isolated in china <cit> . in a previous investigation, in vitro neutralization experiments showed that mutation of the n <dig> asp to asn slightly decreases the neutralizing activity of asp- <dig> sera <cit> . our study showed that the main locations under negative selection were in the endo-domain, following by trans-membrane <dig> trans-membrane <dig> and ecto-domain <dig> this agrees with the findings of xu et al. <cit> . negative selective pressure within the trans-membrane domains may relate to the integrity or functionality of the virion whereas the distribution of sites under purifying selection in the endo-domain could relate to the budding process of prrsv. a similar function has been observed in alphaviruses, where e <dig> and the nucleocapsid protein specifically interact with each other <cit> . in addition, mutations within endo-domain of glycoprotein e <dig> affected the biological characteristic of sindbis virus <cit> . CONCLUSIONS this study first describes the molecular evolution of orf <dig> of prrsv occurred in vietnam since the first outbreaks. phylogenetic analysis based on orf <dig> sequence indicated the diversity of prrsv in vietnam. furthermore, the variance of n-glycosylation sites and position under selective pressure were demonstrated. this study expands existing knowledge on the genetic diversity and evolution of prrsv in vietnam and assists the effective strategies for prrs vaccine development in vietnam. additional files additional file 1: table s <dig> the information of vietnamese prrsv strains using in this study. additional file 2: figure s <dig> classification of vietnamese prrsv strains based on the reference sequences. abbreviations hphighly pathogenic hpdhighest posterior density mcmcmarkov chain monte carlo orfopen reading frame prrsporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrsvporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus tmrcatime to the most recent common ancestor",

prevalence of the outbreaks vary among locations, and the major regional differences in aiv prevalence are thought to be influenced by ecological systems, husbandry practices, cultural behaviours and economic development <cit> . two types of locations are considered as potential hotspots of influenza outbreaks and therefore of particular importance; areas with high ecological complexity and those with high densities of domesticated birds and trade activity. areas with a high ecological complexity include those which are rich in nature reserves, water resources, and on the flyway route of migratory birds. this creates an environment in which domestic ducks and wild aquatic birds live together, sharing water, food, and habitat. three major asian migratory bird flyways, the central asian, east asian-australasian and west pacific flyways have major stop-over sites in china <cit> . qinghai lake in northwest china is one of the most important breeding and stopover sites for migratory birds along the central asian flyway <cit> . in <dig> an outbreak of h5n <dig> in wild birds occurred in qinghai lake, and the viruses carried by wild bird migration from qinghai lake contributed to the global h5n <dig> prevalence and to the increase in human h5n <dig> influenza virus infections . studies of the hpai h5n <dig> outbreaks at qinghai suggest that the influenza viruses were circulated by wild birds through the central asian flyway, and are continuously undergoing evolution . in addition, poyang lake in jiangxi province and dongting lake in hunan province located in south central china are within the east asian flyway, and both possess important national natural reserves and wetlands. these locations have been identified with extensive aiv reassortment events and close interactions between wild migratory birds and domestic poultry, providing opportunities for outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus . locations that have high economy activity and trade have also been considered as a potential epicentre for aiv <cit> . hpai h5n <dig> was first encountered in <dig> in guangdong province in domestic geese. by <dig> the host range had extended to domestic ducks, which played a key role in the genesis of the 2003/ <dig> outbreaks <cit> . the outbreak of human infections with an emerging avian influenza a virus occurred in eastern china since late march <dig> human infection of h7n <dig> appears to be associated with exposure to infected live poultry or contaminated environments, including markets where live poultry are sold <cit> . previous studies on the transmission and distribution of avian influenza virus are mainly focused on the highly pathogenic outbreaks, such as h <dig> and h <dig> <cit> . however, phylogenetic studies have shown that the avian influenza with low pathogenicity in birds could transmit their gene segments to other strains. the gene invasions contribute to the genesis and spread of new reassortant viruses, and with the potential to cause zoonotic outbreaks in human and mammals . in addition, a wide range of inter-subtype reassortments have been found with respect to the internal segments of eurasian aiv. low pathogenic aiv especially in wild or domestic anseriformes are more likely to reassort with each other while highly pathogenic aiv in galliforms exhibits a lower reassortment rate <cit> . therefore, understanding the features of the total interaction pattern of avian influenza viruses with different subtypes, low and high pathogenicity, sampled from both wild and domestic birds are of particular importance. the aim of the study is to describe the pattern of spatial diffusion aiv in bird populations in different regions of china and to indicate the related risk factors across the diversity of economy, agriculture, environment and climate. we explore the key sources and destinations of aiv diffusion in china by using viral sequence data to infer discrete trait phylogeographic models in a bayesian framework. these models provide a quantification of the significant viral spatial transmission rates among regions in terms of agricultural, ecological and economic parameters. the results highlight the importance of the agro-economic impact on the evolution and spatial dissemination of the influenza virus which may inform future strategies for the surveillance and control of influenza. methods sequence data a total of <dig> full length avian influenza genomes isolated from china were downloaded from ncbi flu resources <cit> . for each internal segment, sequences were aligned using muscle <cit> in mega <dig> . <dig> <cit> . preliminary trees for each segment were generated by the neighbour joining method using mega <dig> . <dig> sequences that might contain incorrect date information were detected in these preliminary phylogenies using path-o-gen v <dig> and were removed from the dataset. to account for potential sampling biases in space and time, sequences were subsampled to preserve diversity with respect to location , host, pathogenicity, subtype background and year of sampling using custom r scripts which resulted in <dig> sequences. additionally one clade, composed of h5n <dig> strains mainly isolated from the south central region and monophyletic in all six segments was subsampled further to reduce over-representation but retain genetic diversity. the final dataset composed of all the internal gene segments of <dig> aiv sequences covers an 18-year period from the <dig> to <dig> . time-scaled phylogenetic analysis time-scaled trees were generated for each internal protein-coding segment with the <dig> chinese aiv dataset using beast version <dig> . <dig> <cit> . different substitution models, clock models and tree models were evaluated for segment <dig> by estimating the marginal likelihoods of the models using the harmonic mean estimator and akaike’s information criterion for mcmc samples in tracer, and also by employing path sampling and stepping stone sampling <cit> . a general-time-reversible model with site to site rate variation in four categories from a gamma distribution was chosen as the nucleotide substitution model. a constant population size model and a relaxed uncorrelated log-normal molecular clock model were chosen for all eight segments. the mcmc was run for <dig> steps and sampled every <dig> steps. two independent runs were used in each segment to confirm the convergence and then combined . maximum clade credibility trees for each segment were obtained from the tree posterior samples, and the mean ages of each ancestral node and the corresponding highest posterior density intervals were calculated using tree annotator. spatial diffusion analysis geographic region classification to investigate the spatial diffusion pattern of in china, the locations of the <dig> chinese aiv genomes from a total of <dig> provinces, were categorized into larger regions according to four different schemes: traditional regions , economic regions , economic divided zones , and china agro-ecological regions . traditional regions are the <dig> provincial-level divisions grouped into the six former administrative areas from <dig> to 1952: east, north, northeast, northwest, south central and southwest. economic regions are categorized by the per capita income basis and composed of four areas: east coast, central, northeast and western. the er scheme shows that provinces in the coastal regions of china tend to be more industrialized, while regions further inland are less developed <cit> . economic regions were further divided into seven smaller economic zones according to the result of the trait-phylogeny test described below. specifically, the east coast area is divided into three smaller economic zones areas: yangtze river delta , pan-pearl river delta and bohai economic rim ; the vast and less developed west areas are divided into northwest and southwest, resulting in <dig> zones in total. we also considered using the china agro-ecological regions scheme which contains <dig> regions and groups neighboring provinces by poultry and duck density, distinguishing the plateau region from the south and north west <cit> . the detailed classification and distribution of provinces into regions can be seen in additional file 1: table s <dig> distribution of region traits on tree phylogeny associations between phylogenies and location traits for each region type were tested using bayesian tip-association significance testing <cit> . parsimony score , association index and the monophyletic clade size were calculated on a set of <dig> subsampled trees , and <dig> state randomizations were generated to create the null distributions. discrete trait mapping of the spatial diffusion the rates of viral migration between locations across different regions in china were inferred by using an asymmetric discrete traits model to reconstruct the ancestral subtype states of the internal nodes in time-scaled tree phylogeny of each segment. the significant transition rates between discrete traits were identified with the bayesian stochastic search variable selection extension of the discrete model. for the rates calculated from bssvs, a bf test was adopted to identify significant non-zero transition rates and a cut-off of bf = <dig> was applied <cit> . additionally we performed location state randomisation on the tr, er, ed and car schemes in order to assess the effects of potential sampling bias on the ancestral state reconstructions <cit> . predictors of spatial diffusion predictor data the national statistics bureau and ministry of agriculture’s animal husbandry bureau publish annual statistics for each province in mainland china in <dig> out of total <dig> different categories: including <dig> provinces , two municipalities , four autonomous regions, , including those relating to agro-economics, the environment and climate. we chose some of these statistics as predictors to help inform a phylogeographical model of aiv diffusion in china. data were referenced from the china statistical year book <dig> <cit> and the china agriculture yearbook <dig> <cit> . in the agro-economic categories, we focused on the standard statistics related to the production and sale of poultry productions . the poultry density is the annual counts of each poultry type collected from farms and households at the township level and reported up through county, prefecture, and provincial administrative units with final submission to the national level. given that live bird markets play a crucial role in the maintenance, amplification and dissemination of aiv <cit> , we included the number of farm product markets per provinces as a potential predictor obtained from the national navigation map <cit> . in addition, the agro-economic variables including human population density and the total capacity of transportation per province were also considered. physical environmental variables comprising the coverage of forest, surface water and natural resource were considered as potential predictors, since these may indicate a higher chance of wild birds interacting with poultry . climatic factors including the average annual temperature and the average relative humidity were also considered. finally, the distribution of host types within the aiv dataset were also considered; the proportion of domestic birds vs wild birds; and the proportion of domestic galliformes vs domestic anseriformes . thirty three predictors were collected from <dig> provinces in mainland china . predictors having significantly high correlations > = <dig> ) and measuring similar aspects were grouped, and we kept one predictor per group, leaving <dig> predictors. in addition, the number of aiv sequences per discrete location was considered as a separate predictor to test the impact of sampling effects on the diffusion process . predictor data at the provinces level was integrated into regions according to the traditional and economic region schemes . the final <dig> predictors for each region type are summarized in table <dig> table <dig> predictors for traditional regions and economic divided regions the data of <dig> selected predictors per area for the <dig> types of regions the unit of each predictors are listed below: <dig> poultry density <dig> number of farm product markets <dig> stock volume of forest <dig> percentage of nature reserves <dig> average temperature of major cities <dig> average relative humidity <dig> surface water resources <dig> population density <dig> freight by transportation total <dig> sample size <dig> − <dig> − <dig> − <dig> − <dig> − <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> − <dig> − <dig> − <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> the values in the cell represent the correlation coefficient of the two predictors in the column and row, > <dig> indicates a supported positive correlation and < − <dig> indicates a supported negative correlation. the predictors which have weak correlation with others are put into the same glm analysis, with the correlation coefficient values marked in bold hypothesis test of predictors to test the contribution of potential predictors for the ctmc transition rate matrix between locations, an extension of the phylogenetic diffusion model was used to parameterize these rates as a log-linear function of a set of predictor matrices within a generalised linear model <cit> . the glm specifies coefficients for each predictor, allowing the estimation of their contribution to the diffusion process and indicator variables to model the inclusion or exclusion of each predictor. in this study we created matrices for each predictor in regional categories , and these were transformed to log space and normalised prior to their incorporation. symmetric and asymmetric matrices were used. firstly, we performed several individual analyses, using pairs of independent predictors as shown in table <dig> to determine the importance of one predictor relative to the other. the independent predictor pairs and their impact on the spatial transmission were analysed in glm models. secondly we also performed a single glm-diffusion analysis including all predictors as well as sample size as a predictor, and one in which all the predictors except sample sizes were used to examine the possible sample size effect. in analyses with many predictors, a binomial prior that prefers the inclusion of a small number of predictors was used together with a multivariate normal updater for the coefficients which considers their correlation as described in faria et al. <cit> . RESULTS phylogeographic evolution of aiv in china in this study the data set consisted of <dig> aiv genomes which were obtained from <dig> out of the <dig> provinces in china. of these, guangdong, fujian, hunan, jiangsu and jiangxi provinces had the highest number of sequences . the majority of aiv in the dataset was sampled from domestic birds, with <dig> % from domestic anseriformes , <dig> % from domestic galliformes , and <dig> % from wild birds . subtypes h <dig> h <dig> h <dig> and h <dig> are prevalent in china and are circulating in domestic birds, and our dataset includes <dig> % h5n <dig> and <dig> % h9n <dig> bayesian phylogenetic trees of the <dig> internal segments of the <dig> chinese aiv were generated . the evolutionary rates for five segments were estimated and range from <dig> × 10− <dig> to <dig> × 10− <dig> substitutions per site per year. the estimated time to most recent common ancestors of these five internal segments range from <dig> to <dig> however, the ns segment has a lower substitution rate and earlier tmrca due to the divergent alleles a and b <cit> , the detailed evolutionary rate and tmrca estimations for each aiv segment can be found in additional file 1: table s <dig> the strength of phylogeny-trait association was further tested on different regions types upon the bayesian phylogenetic trees of the pb <dig> segment. the results are summarized in table <dig> and statistical analysis of ai and ps of the full phylogeny revealed that for tr, er, and ed, the total number of migration events occurring in each category was less than expected under the null hypothesis indicating that there is a sufficient correlation between these geographical characters and the phylogeny. however, the ai and ps statistics under the car scheme were not significant. the significance of the clustering of areas within each region type was further indicated by the estimation of the maximum monophyletic clade size. there is evidence of clustering of aiv belonging to each of the six areas in the traditional region; northeast and central areas which belong to the economic region also have a strong clustering support. however, the east coast area is the most dominant group among economic regions with a significantly higher value than the other areas . this shows a very strong phylogeny-trait association thus indicating strong gene flow within the areas rather than to the other areas. to further identify the pattern of gene flow within east coast region, we further divided it into three economic zones: pan-pearl river delta , yangtze river delta and bohai economic rim . the three smaller economic zones showed evidence of trait-phylogeny correlation with the mc value from <dig> to <dig> with strong supported. in addition, the western area showed poor statistical support, indicating the aiv are randomly distributed across the tree phylogeny rather than clustering together in the same clade. this can be explained by the limited number of sequences sampled from ten provinces divided into a northwest and a southwest area with supported clustering for both with mean mc = <dig> table <dig> results of trait-phylogeny association of different region types on pb2 regiona aregion type classification; bthe three statistics: association index , parsimony score and maximum monophyletic clade size of the area traits per region type; cthe last <dig> columns correspond to posterior estimates of observed and expected values and the p value for the ai, ps and mc metrics. lower ai and ps values represent strong phylogeny–trait association; while larger values of mean mc indicate increased phylogeny-trait association and the significance indicated by p-value we also compared the trait-phylogeny interaction among the six internal segments using the economic regions as traits . in the full phylogenies, ai and ps varied among six internal segments, ranging from pb <dig> to ns , indicating an increase in gene flow from pb <dig> and ns. similar results are found in the mc size of the east coast area, which is the area with the majority of aiv, the mc size of pb <dig> is larger than the other five segments, while ns has the lowest value , which indicated it is more randomly distributed, which could be attributed to the allele a and b divergence of ns segment <cit> . quantified spatial diffusion patterns to explore the spatial diffusion patterns of aiv across different regions in china, we used a discrete trait procedure on the empirical trees sampled from the posterior distribution of original phylogenies of the six internal segments. patterns of aiv spatial diffusion in china were quantified under a bssvs procedure. in each internal segment phylogeny, tree branches are coloured to the predicted states of the descendent node, according to geographic distance or the economic relationship . co-circulation of multiple lineages and diverse gene flows of avian influenza virus between different areas of china were detected. for the tr areas, we found that south central is the source of the majority of lineages . multiple introductions are observed among the economic divided region type, with the pan-pearl river delta as the main ancestor of all aiv, and the central area represented as the source of two main clades .fig. <dig> bayesian mcc phylogenies and between-regions diffusion networks on pb <dig> gene segment of aiv in china. the sequences are classified according to their variant designation in tr: traditional geographic regions; ed: economic divided zones. branches are coloured according to their descendent nodes annotated by the different sampled areas within the region type, with the key for colours shown on the left. a tree phylogeny with branches

zones for pb <dig> segment are shown on the maps in fig. <dig> . the detailed diffusion rate and bf support for each region and each internal segment are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> . in general, the bssvs procedure identified supported transition rates between locations for all segments in both region types . however not all the strongly supported bf rates actually correspond to a high magnitude transition rate. the average diffusion rate of six internal segments also vary .fig. <dig> diffusion networks with quantified diffusion rate and bf support. quantified diffusion rate between regions and bf support were estimated by an irreversible discrete trait model on the phylogeny of pb <dig> segment. areas for each region type are labelled by the same colour in the region annotated phylogenetic trees in fig. <dig> the size of the blue circles represent the aiv sample size in each area. the diffusion rate and statistical support for all six internal segments are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig> and table s <dig> the map source is national science & technology infrastructure of china, national earth system science data sharing infrastructure . traditional regions and economic divided zones were mapped in arcgis . the diffusion networks on the maps were made via cytoscape v <dig> . <dig> . a diffusion network of aiv among traditional regions. b diffusion network of aiv among economic divided zones among the <dig> possible transition rates between locations for the traditional regions , three are found with significant bf support in pb <dig> pa and np segments, while two are found in the other segments. the south central area was found to play a role as a major source region transmitting aiv to the east , northwest and southwest areas . this also can be seen in the region-annotated mcc tree which shows that the majority of the ancestral nodes are inferred to have a south central location . the most significant gene flow is from south central to east area . the northwest area is also likely to accept aiv virus from other areas. invasions were also found from northeast or from south central to other areas, but only with moderate support . the only bidirectional transmissions are found between south central and east in pb <dig> segment. using the economic zones classification of locations , two major sources of aiv migration are found . one is the central area , which has highly supported virus transmissions into the southwest area and yrd . the other source is prd with high supported transmissions to yrd and central areas . in addition, the guangxi province might also play an important role as a source location when it is included in the southwest area in ed type. there are wild bird migration routes from southwest to northeast, northwest and ber, however these routes have weak support . in comparison, aiv are mainly transmitted to two economic zones: yrd and ber . specifically, yrd mainly receives aiv from central and moderate supported invasion from prd . a high transmission rate is identified from yrd to ber , which is consistent in all six segments with high support . results from discrete traits analyses can be influenced by severely under or over-represented numbers of sequences with respect to location states. to mitigate this potential bias, we selected the samples from those publically available, applying a random subsampling procedure to attempt to preserve diversity in province location, host, subtype and year whilst reducing over-representation in south central area in this study. however, given that the sample size is correlated with poultry density and also reflective of the actual prevalence of aiv , we did not down-sample aiv sequences to even number between different regions in china, because that would severely reduce the subtype and host diversity within those regions with the highest aiv prevalence. therefore, we also investigated the effect of sampling heterogeneity on ancestral state reconstruction by performing sensitivity analyses using location state randomization <cit> . in ed, sampling frequencies of location states have little impact on the root location probability and the permutated states, the south central region had the highest root state frequency.. therefore, the state reconstruction of the traditional region classification scheme may still influenced by the large number of samples from the south central region, but this is an area with dense avian populations so the inclusion of a higher number of samples from this region is appropriate hypothesis-based spatial analysis ten potential predictors over categories including economic activity, environment, climate as well as the sample size of aiv were selected to identify the possible factors that determine the viral diffusion of avian influenza among different regions of aiv in china, by employing a generalized linear model which is an extension of a bayesian phylogenetic diffusion model on six internal genes. in this study, individual analyses using pairs of uncorrelated predictors were performed, and a single glm-diffusion analysis including all ten predictors was also conducted. in the single glm analysis, only sample size was strongly correlated with viral spatial diffusion, the other predictors showed no sign of correlation with diffusion. we also performed an analysis with all predictors but excluding sample sizes, which gave weaker but still significant coefficients and bf supports compared to those estimated using separate analysis, indicating the inclusion/exclusion of sample size with other predictors in the same glm analysis can have a strong impact on the results . however, several predictors are correlated with sample size , which is unsurprising since the sampling is expected to be approximately reflective of prevalence. therefore, individual analyses using pairs of uncorrelated predictors were preferred and the results were described below. the identified determinants of spatial aiv diffusion are summarized in fig. <dig> which shows the mean and 95% hpd of the bf support for each predictor as well as the conditional effect sizes on a log scale. the conditional effect sizes are the estimated effect sizes when the indicators = <dig> and they summarize the coefficients conditional on the predictor being included in the glm model. the results of all six internal segments and both region types are summarized in fig. <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> fig. <dig> predictors of chinese aiv spatial diffusion. the inclusion probabilities shown in the bar plots are defined by the indicator expectations which reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor; the predictors with bayes factor are indicated with the corresponding bf value ; the contribution of each predictor, when included in the model is represented by the conditional effect sizes and 95% hpd on a log scale . the zero line not included in the credible intervals indicates the positive correlation or the negative correlation fig. <dig> predictors of the chinese aiv spatial diffusion on <dig> internal genes segments. for the <dig> predictors, their correlations to the aiv diffusion in two region types are summarized in the cells, with rows representing predictors and columns representing six internal segments of the chinese aiv dataset. the markers of the correlation with statistical supports are on the right. red indicates positive correlation, blue indicates negative correlation. the rank of colours indicating the bayes factor support from low to high; blank cells indicate that either no correlation or no bf support was detected. the inclusion probabilities and the log coefficients for each predictor for each region type in all six internal segments are in additional file 1: table s8 in general, the potential predictors have strongly directional impacts on the aiv spatial diffusion, which means that the predictors have significant impacts on the sources and/or the recipients rather than the overall transmission. the impacts are not always consistent among the six internal segments, which can be reflected in both the effective sample size and the bf support, more so for the economic zones than for the traditional regions , but similar trends are found for predictors of transmission between traditional regions across segments, with varied statistical support . overall we found the agro-economic predictors played decisive roles in viral spread in both traditional regions and economic zones in china. specifically, poultry population density and productivity have a significant positive correlation, consistent in all six segments with high estimated size of the effect . the statistical support for its inclusion in the model indicated that the locations with high poultry density and productivity are more likely to accept the viral migration. the glm diffusion model also revealed that the number of farm product markets is also a driver of the aiv dissemination in china. it has a negative correlation in the source and positive impact in the destination regions in all six segments, indicating the direction of high viral transmission rate is towards the location with high demands of poultry products. the productivity and sale of poultry is also linked with the impact of human actions, and human population density in the destination location has support in the models for different segments. interestingly, the capacity of freight transportation has the most significant impact on the viral diffusion , indicating the movement of avian influenza virus is mainly dependent on the human transportation, not through wild bird migration. in addition, climate factors are have impact on the inferred diffusion pattern; locations having comparably higher temperature and higher humidity are more likely to accept the virus than those with lower values. the environmental factors impact on the viral diffusion to some degree. surface water resources has a negative impact on the source regions in pa, np, m and ns segments, suggested that aiv are not likely to be transmitted from region that is rich in water resources; and the coverage of natural reserves has a slight negative correlation with the recipient location of the viral diffusion in only pb <dig> and pb <dig> segments , while forest coverage does not yield noticeable support in the models for any of the segments. the possible impacts of the distribution of host population based on the aiv dataset are also considered as possible explanatory variables in the glm model in this study, but neither of these have any statistical supported for impact on viral diffusion . discussion by applying phylogeographical diffusion models, the key source/sink locations were captured and the rates of movement were simultaneously informed from the evolutionary history of the viral segments encoding for internal proteins. the results highlighted that aiv in china were mainly exported from the yangtze river delta and the south central area . previously, martin et al. have postulated yrd as a hypothetical influenza epicentre <cit> , while considering that the multiple viral exposures from south central areas are probably due to its location along the central asian flyway <cit> . in addition, h <dig> viruses with multiple na subtypes were found in ducks in jiangxi province , suggesting an epidemiological bridge from migratory birds to sentinel farm ducks and then to market birds. epidemiological studies also suggested that hpai h5n <dig> outbreaks in poultry mostly occurred in areas which overlapped with habitats for wild birds, whereas outbreaks in wild birds were mainly found in areas where food and shelter are available <cit> . bidirectional movement of wild birds among the provinces along the flyway route in south central areas were identified in studies tracking the movements of migrating wild birds, and the transmission of hpai h5n <dig> to qinghai lake have also been identified <cit> . the ha and na genes of the recent human h7n <dig> cases may originate from duck avian influenza viruses, which might have obtained the viral genes from wild ducks along the east asian flyway a year before <cit> . in contrast, the east coast areas especially yrd are major targets for receiving the viral strains. the importance of the east coastal region as the hotspot of avian influenza outbreaks is supported by previous studies: the potential hotspots for h5n <dig> reassortment being identified in previous studies are the coastal provinces <cit> ; hpai h5n <dig> risk distributions are identified in both south and north of the yrd <cit> . in addition, the recent h7n <dig> outbreaks occurred initially in the yrd, and then spread along both south and north of the east coast lines <cit> . the transmission between southwest and northwest is supported by the studies that identified the outbreaks reported in poultry or wild birds on the qinghai-tibet plateau. the initial outbreaks occurred in poultry then occurred in wild birds afterwards. the locations of outbreaks started in lasa then were transmitted to tibet <cit> . no significant viral exposure has been identified from the northeast china. northeast china has a rapid development of intensive chicken production with intensive poultry production systems. it has invested in disease prevention measures and applies mass vaccination of their flocks in order to prevent viral infection and spread <cit> . most of china's economic production and growth originate in the coastal regions. the prd and yrd have served as the commercial arteries for china’s economic development and major manufacturing and transportation hubs since late 1970s; ber is rising as a vital economic region in north in recent years. cities in economic zones have built a complete network for water, land and air transportation, and are interconnected by highways and railways <cit> . therefore, the strong transport connections among the three economic zones can explain the strong viral flow linkages being found in our study, especially between prd and yrd, which showed a trend of bidirectional transmission. in addition, the connection can also be the explanation of the extremely strong positive correlation between the capability of transportation and the gene flow that identified in the glm results. we found poultry density is strongly correlated with viral diffusion in the aiv sink regions. more than 75% of the world's domestic duck population is bred in china and more than <dig> billion chickens in china, of which 60% are raised on small farms <cit> . shandong and hebei are the major sources of the output of poultry meat and have the highest poultry density, whereas the prd has much less poultry being raised in the commercial farms with more being raised as free range and backyard <cit> . similarly, regions with higher number of live bird markets are more likely to accept the aiv gene flow. most of the live poultry markets in china and southeast asia have been characterized by poor sanitation where the domestic ducks and geese are being housed together with chickens <cit> . our results supported that aiv epidemiological processes are more likely to occur in highly-populated areas, and there are higher possibilities of aiv transmission through trade and farming-related activities <cit> . similarly, regions with higher number of live bird markets are more likely to accept the aiv gene flow. most of the live poultry markets in china and southeast asia have been characterized by poor sanitation where the domestic ducks and geese are being housed together with chickens <cit> . surveillance and phylogenetic studies showed that the current human h7n <dig> outbreak virus has spread over a large geographic region and is prevalent in poultry and in live poultry markets in the outbreak areas, which are thought to be the immediate source of human infections <cit> . our results also supported that aiv epidemiological processes are more likely to occur in highly-populated areas, and there are higher likelihood of outbreak detections and higher possibilities of hpaiv h5n <dig> transmission through trade and farming-related activities <cit> . the climate and natural factors have a mild impact on the viral spatial diffusion when considering analysis by geographic regions, but little or no impact on aiv diffusion among the economic regions. firstly, aiv are highly likely to be transmitted to areas with higher temperature and humidity, which also can be explained by the warmer regions as a rest place for migrating wild birds. the transmission of aiv is mainly by faeces and contact between bird populations , and the pathway also differs between wild birds and terrestrial birds, thus this is not expected to be influenced by the same factors as airborne transmission in humans <cit> . in addition, aiv transmission are shown to have impact from the amount surface water resources and the coverage of natural reserves. this is consistent with the suggestion that aiv are likely to be transmitted into areas rich in water resources and natural reserves such as wetlands and lakes that are important stopover, breeding, or wintering sites for migratory water birds <cit> . it is crucial to recognize that if variables in the glm are correlated, the results can be misleading. a previous similar study also showed that the sample size absorbed effect of other predictors in a glm model <cit> . therefore, pairs of uncorrelated predictors were used in separate analyses in this study, and a single glm-diffusion analysis including all ten predictors was also conducted for comparison. the results showed no predictor expects sample size has correlation with viral spatial diffusion. in addition, we did analysis with all predictors together but excluding sample sizes, which gave weaker but still significant coefficients and bf support compared to those estimated by using separate analysis, indicating the inclusion/exclusion of sample size with other predictors in the same glm analysis impacts the results. however, certain predictors are correlated with sample size in this study, so the results of glm analysis are expected to be affected when sample size is included together with other correlated predictors. finally since the agricultural and economics statistics are updated each year, it would be interesting to take into consideration the change of the agricultural and economic factors through the same years as the phylogenetic time scales to explain the aiv evolution for future studies. CONCLUSIONS in summary, this study describes the aiv diffusion pattern among geographic regions and economic zones in china by looking at the evolution of internal segments of aiv sequences. we found that transmission patterns of avian influenza virus in china are mainly driven by exposure from the south region and the central region, which are composed of the areas along the east asian migration routes also with high density of poultry industry; while virus tends to be imported into the east coast areas that are economically developed. we highlight that the transmission between regions of aiv in china is largely driven by human activity including transportation of the poultry product and trade rather than natural and ecological conditions. the impact of economic development on the transportation of domestic animals and the agricultural practices may enhance spread and evolution of influenza in certain areas, and good biosecurity measures as adopted in the north east region may limit viral transmission. also, agricultural policy should be coherent with public health policy with the aim to reduce the risk of emergence of cross-host transmission from animals to humans. additional files additional file 1: table s <dig> tree model fit comparison. table s <dig> classification of provinces into areas in four region types. table s <dig> results of trait-phylogeny association of different segments. table s <dig> estimation of evolution parameters of different segments. table s <dig> host type and subtype correlation with sample size. table s <dig> transmission rate and statistical support between areas from traditional regions. table s <dig> transmission rate and statistical support between areas from economic divided zones. table s <dig> coefficients of predictors of spatial diffusion of chinese aiv from glm analysis. table s <dig> sequence information and accession number of <dig> internal segments of aiv in this study. table s <dig> original <dig> predictor data per province. additional file 2: figure s <dig> host distribution of <dig> chinese aiv sequences in traditional region, economic region, economic divided zone, and china agro-ecological region types. figure s <dig> distributions of <dig> chinese aiv sequences in the sampled time, host order, subtype and sampled provinces. figure s <dig> influence of the sampling scheme on the phylogeographic reconstruction. figure s <dig> pb <dig> tree mapping with region traits. figure s <dig> pa tree mapping with region traits. figure s <dig> np tree mapping with region traits. figure s <dig> m tree mapping with region traits. figure s <dig> ns tree mapping with region traits. additional file 3: figure s <dig> bayesian mcc phylogenies of <dig> internal segments of <dig> chinese aiv sequences labelled with sequence names on tips and bayesian posterior probability on nodes. pb2; pb1; pa; np; m; ns.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the methodology and results presented in this excerpt. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND when organisms are exposed to protein-denaturing stressors such as heat, the heat shock response is engaged to manage protein damage and restore proteostasis <cit> . the hsr is highly conserved across species and is regulated by the transcription factor heat shock factor <dig> . during basal conditions, hsf <dig> exists as a monomer in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and during stress conditions undergoes trimerization and accumulation in the nucleus, where it binds to heat shock elements in the promoters of heat shock protein genes <cit> . hsps primarily act as molecular chaperones which refold the misfolded proteins that accumulate during stress, but they can also have essential functions in protein synthesis, processing, and degradation <cit> . thus the hsr, and hsps, play a large role in maintaining organismal proteostasis. the soil-dwelling, free-living, nematode caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful model organism that has provided insights into the regulation of a number of stress response pathways, including the hsr. hsf- <dig> the c. elegans homolog to mammalian hsf <dig> contains conserved n-terminal dna-binding and trimerization domains, as well as a putative transactivation domain at the c-terminus <cit> . it has recently been shown that the same activity steps required for mammalian hsf <dig> activation, including trimerization, hyperphosphorylation, and induction of dna-binding, are also required for worm hsf- <dig> activation <cit> . studies in c. elegans show that hsf- <dig> plays a central role not only in the hsr, but also in contributing to organismal physiology. hsf- <dig> is essential to worm viability, as a truncated mutant that lacks the c-terminal putative activation domain is defective in chaperone induction and egg laying, and also has a decreased lifespan <cit> . in addition, this strain has a temperature-sensitive developmental arrest phenotype, with arrest occurring at the l2-l <dig> transition <cit> . various experiments using hsf- <dig> rna interference have shown that hsf- <dig> regulates the expression of specific hsp genes upon heat shock , and have also implicated a non-stress-induced role for hsf- <dig> in processes including development, metabolism, and longevity . interestingly, studies in c. elegans have identified the hsr as a cell non-autonomous process that requires thermosensory neurons for hsp induction <cit> . upon the completion of sequencing of the c. elegans genome, over 40 % of the predicted protein products were found to be significantly conserved in other organisms <cit> , and many signaling pathways are conserved <cit> . c. elegans is thus an excellent model system for studying the role of hsf- <dig> in stress responses and other physiological processes in a simple multicellular organism. in this study, we have performed rna-sequencing with synchronous larval stage l <dig> wild-type c. elegans fed empty vector control rnai or hsf- <dig> rnai treated with or without hs. we show that significant numbers of genes are upregulated as well as downregulated by hsf- <dig> under both conditions. in addition to hsp genes, hsf- <dig> is required for the regulation of genes involved in a wide variety of cellular processes including cytoprotection, development, metabolism, and aging. network analysis points to possible routes by which hsf- <dig> signaling may be coordinated across tissues. a nuclear hormone receptor may coordinate the hs-induced hsf- <dig> transcriptional response, while an epidermal growth factor receptor may coordinate the hs-independent response. surprisingly, the top hsf-1-regulated gene category, both with and without heat stress, is cuticle structure. this result, together with other recent studies, thus links regulation of the extracellular matrix to hsf- <dig> cytoprotection, and longevity. RESULTS experimental set-up for genome-wide analysis of regulation of gene expression by hsf-1 previous experiments have shown that hsf- <dig> regulates the expression of specific hsp genes upon hs, and have also implicated a non-stress-induced role for hsf- <dig> in development, metabolism, and longevity . to examine hs-dependent vs. -independent gene regulation by hsf- <dig> on a genome-wide level, we used whole transcriptome rna-sequencing. we treated synchronous l <dig> larval stage nematodes with rnai against hsf- <dig> or with an ev control plasmid until the l <dig> larval stage. at the l <dig> stage, we then treated nematodes from both groups with or without a 30 min 33 °c hs, as diagrammed . experiments were performed in biological duplicates. the l <dig> stage was chosen for our studies as this is a time when the response to hs is strong, prior to a sharp decline that occurs shortly after the transition to adulthood <cit> . these treatment conditions, optimized for our studies, resulted in a ~9- log2-fold induction of the hsp- <dig> gene c12c <dig> , a classical hsf- <dig> target gene, in hsf- <dig> animals treated with hs . as expected, rnai against hsf- <dig> blunted hsp- <dig> induction by hs . the efficiency of our rnai feeding strategy was assessed by testing the effects of hsf- <dig> rnai on transcription driven by two heat shock protein promoter- gfp reporter worm strains . hs increases gfp expression, and this effect is dependent on hsf- <dig> as demonstrated with hsf- <dig> rnai. using an hsf-1::gfp overexpression worm strain, we also show that hsf- <dig> protein levels are reduced 80 % in response to hsf- <dig> rnai treatment . overall, these data validate our hs treatment conditions and rnai feeding strategy. cluster analysis performed on biological replicate rna-seq samples revealed conserved patterns of expression induced by each treatment condition . we normalized each condition to the hsf-1;-hs control in order to determine fold changes in relative rna abundance . a complete list of the significant genes altered in response to each condition, after normalization to the control, is also provided . volcano plot analyses show that while a limited group of genes for each comparison have a log2-fold change of <dig> or higher, the majority of genes have a log <dig> -fold change of approximately <dig> or less . as growth temperature and hsf- <dig> expression levels can affect the rate of development in the worm <cit> , we verified that our observed gene expression changes were not simply due to a change in the rate of development between each treatment condition. to do this, we analyzed several genes that are known to be differentially expressed during development and molting, including abu- <dig> wrt- <dig> his- <dig> lin- <dig> abu- <dig> abu <dig> pqn- <dig> pin- <dig> ptr- <dig> abu- <dig> abu- <dig> and sdz- <dig> <cit> , and detected no significant expression differences in these genes across treatment groups . overall, our data indicate that the worms in our four treatment conditions are developmentally synchronous to one another, and that the biological replicates for each condition share a similar expression profile, thus validating our experimental conditions. next, to visualize total hs-dependent vs. -independent gene expression regulated by hsf- <dig> we constructed a venn diagram with the differentially expressed genes for each condition which were determined to be statistically significant as compared to the hsf-1;-hs control . the shaded areas of the venn diagram correspond to hs-dependent and -independent processes regulated by hsf- <dig> , and these are the transcripts that we have focused our subsequent analyses on. altogether, we found that <dig> genes are significantly regulated by hsf- <dig> during hs , and that <dig> genes are significantly regulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs , highlighting that hsf- <dig> regulates both hs-dependent and -independent transcriptional processes. interestingly, only <dig> genes are significantly regulated by hs independently of hsf- <dig> hsf- <dig> is thus not only an essential transcriptional regulator for a majority of the genes altered by hs, but global rna expression analysis supports a gene-regulatory role for hsf- <dig> under both heat stress and non-stress conditions. a greater number of gene changes that depend on hsf- <dig> are independent of heat stress, thus highlighting the important role of hsf- <dig> in regulating gene expression under non-stress conditions. genes that are regulated by hsf- <dig> in response to hs genes that are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> in response to hs to determine whether hsf- <dig> can affect gene expression in both a positive and negative fashion, we separated out the positively vs. negatively regulated genes and analyzed them by venn diagram. we find that <dig> transcripts are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> upon hs . we next examined these <dig> genes in more depth. the top <dig> genes in this category are listed in table <dig> . included in the top <dig> upregulated transcripts are <dig> hsp- <dig> family genes and <dig> hsp- <dig> family genes, all with log2-fold changes greater than <dig> the presence of chaperone genes in our top <dig> hits was expected, and gave us confidence in our experimental strategy. aside from chaperone genes, there are a number of non-chaperones included in the top <dig> most upregulated genes, including the nucleosome remodeling factor complex member nurf- <dig> <cit> , the predicted collagen gene col- <dig> and various genes of unknown function . therefore, the top <dig> genes regulated by hsf- <dig> under hs conditions include <dig> hsp genes and <dig> genes with diverse functions.fig. <dig> genes that are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> in response to hs. a the venn diagram shows the overlap among genes that were found to be significantly upregulated for each of the indicated comparisons between samples. the dark blue shaded area includes genes that are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> upon hs. the q-value is the fdr-adjusted p-value of the test statistic, as determined by the benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple testing. b hierarchical clustering of the genes normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> upon hs. lane <dig> corresponds to the fold change of the <dig> genes found in the dark blue section of the venn diagram in in the hsf-1;+hs vs. control samples. as a comparison, lane <dig> corresponds to the fold change of the same genes found in lane <dig> but in the hsf-1;+hs vs. control samples, as determined by rna-seq. the heat map was organized using cluster <dig> by k-means and euclidean distance. c top processes normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> during hs. the genes found in the dark blue section of the venn diagram in were classified by gene ontology terms that were determined using david f44e <dig> f44e <dig> f44e <dig> f44e <dig> y46h3a.3 hsp- <dig> y46h3a.2 hsp- <dig> t27e <dig> hsp- <dig> c12c <dig> hsp-70 t27e <dig> hsp- <dig> t27e <dig> hsp- <dig> y38e10a.13 nspe-1 t27e <dig> hsp- <dig> f26h <dig> nurf-1 zc <dig> zc <dig> d <dig> scp-1 r <dig> r <dig> b <dig> col-149 the transcript id, gene name, fold change as compared to the hsf-1;-hs control, and description as provided from wormbase, are listed for the <dig> genes with the highest positive fold changes in expression. a complete list of significantly upregulated transcripts is given we then further examined the induction characteristics of the top <dig> hsf-1-dependent genes induced by hs. the log2-fold changes for a subset of these genes are plotted and compared to the expression of the same genes in the presence of hs but in the absence of hsf- <dig> . the fact that hsf- <dig> rnai completely eliminates hs-inducibility of these genes highlights their dependency on hsf- <dig> independent quantitative rt-pcr for the same subset of highly induced genes validates our rna-seq data. in order to better visualize the global patterns of transcript upregulation by hsf- <dig> in response to hs, we constructed a heat map of the <dig> significantly upregulated genes . interestingly, and consistent with the data for a set of the top <dig> upregulated genes , genes that are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> upon hs are either unchanged or downregulated under hs conditions upon hsf- <dig> knockdown on a global level . the fact that many of the <dig> hs-induced genes that require hsf- <dig> are downregulated upon hsf- <dig> knockdown implies that hsf- <dig> may play a role in the basal regulation of these genes, which is then enhanced upon hs. together, these data demonstrate the hsf- <dig> dependency of most hs-induced genes. to identify the various functional processes normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> during hs, we used the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery classification tool to define the top <dig> gene ontology terms for all of the <dig> genes found to be significantly upregulated . the complete output from david is also provided . surprisingly, the top functional category, with an enrichment score of <dig> contains genes involved in cuticle structure. the next four categories, all with enrichment scores under <dig> include genes involved in translation, the response to stress, the regulation of growth, and amine catabolic processes. we thus find that the largest functional category of genes regulated by hs is not the expected heat stress-responsive gene-set, but instead genes associated with forming cuticle structure. we next tested the effects of a cuticle collagen gene, col- <dig> on induction of the hsr by measuring hsp- <dig> promoter activity in phsp-70::gfp worms . we see that col- <dig> rnai decreases hs-induced hsp- <dig> promoter activity, and may control tissue-specific regulation of the hsr. testing the effects of other collagen genes on regulation of the hsr may provide insight into a signaling role for collagens in coordinating stress responses. genes that are normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> in response to hs we next examined the genes separated out from the venn diagram analysis to be normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> upon hs . we find that there are <dig> transcripts in this group . the top <dig> genes normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> upon hs are listed in table <dig> . there are a variety of distinct transcripts downregulated by hsf- <dig> during hs. the gene with the largest log2-fold decrease is acs- <dig> which encodes an acyl-coa synthetase. this enzyme participates in breakdown of fatty acids into acyl-coa in the mitochondria to allow for β-oxidation, thus increasing fat consumption <cit> . another downregulated gene is dct- <dig> which encodes a protein that has pro-apoptotic activity <cit> . the tetraspanin family member tsp- <dig> is also downregulated. the tetraspanin family of proteins is required for epithelial integrity in the worm and regulates cuticle formation <cit> . other downregulated genes include fbxa- <dig> and fbxa- <dig> which encode fboxa proteins with unknown functions; nep- <dig> which encodes a zinc metallopeptidase that negatively regulates signaling peptides <cit> ; glc- <dig> which encodes a subunit of a glutamate-gated chloride channel <cit> ; and delm- <dig> which encodes an ortholog of an acid-sensing ion channel family member <cit> . there are also multiple transcripts of unknown function in this gene group. therefore, the top <dig> genes normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> under hs conditions have a diverse set of functions.fig. <dig> genes that are normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> in response to hs. a the venn diagram shows the overlap among genes that were found to be significantly downregulated for each of the indicated comparisons between samples. the dark purple shaded area includes genes that are normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> upon hs. the q-value is the fdr-adjusted p-value of the test statistic, as determined by the benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple testing. b hierarchical clustering of the genes normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> upon hs. lane <dig> corresponds to the fold change of the <dig> genes found in the dark purple section of the venn diagram in in the hsf-1;+hs vs. control samples. as a comparison, lane <dig> corresponds to the fold change of the same genes found in lane <dig> but in the hsf-1;+hs vs control samples, as determined by rna-seq. the heat map was organized using cluster <dig> by k-means and euclidean distance. c top processes normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> during hs. the genes found in the dark purple section of the venn diagram in were classified by gene ontology terms that were determined using david f28f <dig> acs-2 w09g <dig> w09g <dig> c07a <dig> c07a <dig> c14f <dig> dct-1 c02f <dig> tsp-1 y54f10bm.11 fbxa-66 y119d3b.9 fbxa-21

as compared to the hsf-1;-hs control, and description as provided from wormbase are listed for the <dig> genes with the highest negative fold changes in expression. a complete list of significantly downregulated transcripts is given we then further studied the top <dig> genes that are normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> upon hs. the log2-fold changes of a subset of the top <dig> hsf-1-dependent genes repressed by hs are plotted , and these data are compared to the expression of the same genes in the presence of hs but in the absence of hsf- <dig> . interestingly, we found that all of the genes that are downregulated by hs in the presence of hsf- <dig> are upregulated by hs in the absence of hsf- <dig> one way this could occur is if hsf- <dig> normally suppresses the expression of these genes, and hs-activated hsf- <dig> suppresses them even further. to verify our rna-seq data, we performed independent qrt-pcr for the same subset of highly downregulated genes, and found that the qrt-pcr data was consistent with our rna-seq data . to visualize the patterns of transcripts that are normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> upon hs, we constructed a heat map to visualize the log2-fold changes of the <dig> significantly downregulated genes . as a comparison, the expression of the same transcripts under hs conditions upon hsf- <dig> knockdown is shown . as with the data for the top downregulated genes , many of the <dig> genes that are normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> under hs conditions are conversely upregulated by hs in the absence of hsf- <dig> thus, hs can have completely opposite effects on gene expression depending on the presence or absence of hsf- <dig> upon david analysis of gene ontology terms for the repressed genes, the top <dig> functional categories all had enrichment scores of <dig> or lower. these functional categories include genes that encode proteins with kinase activity, ion binding activity, transcription, atp-binding activity, and reproductive development . the complete output from david is also provided . overall, these results show that a diverse group of genes are normally suppressed by hsf- <dig> during hs. genes that are regulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs genes that are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs while hsf- <dig> has been historically studied for its role in regulating responses elicited by hs, hsf- <dig> also has functions that are independent of hs including roles in development, metabolism, and longevity . to identify processes upregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs, we examined the <dig> genes from the venn diagram that we determined to be downregulated in response to hsf- <dig> rnai independently of hs, suggesting that they are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> . in order to gain insight into the normal hsf-1-regulatory role of these hs-independent genes, we reversed our data comparison to obtain the fold change, as this gene group is shown to be downregulated in response to hsf- <dig> rnai and would thus normally be upregulated by hsf- <dig> fig. <dig> genes that are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs. a the venn diagram shows the overlap among genes that were found to be significantly downregulated for each of the indicated comparisons between samples. the light purple shaded area includes genes that are downregulated upon treatment with hsf- <dig> rnai, and are likely normally induced by hsf- <dig> independently of heat shock, therefore are referred to as upregulated genes. the q-value is the fdr-adjusted p-value of the test statistic, as determined by the benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple testing. b hierarchical clustering of the genes normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs. the fold change of genes found in the light purple section of the venn diagram in were determined by rna-seq to be downregulated in response to hsf- <dig> rnai, and would thus normally be upregulated by hsf- <dig> lane <dig> corresponds to the fold change of these genes in the control vs. hsf-1;-hs samples, and as a comparison, lane <dig> corresponds to each the fold change of the same genes found in lane <dig> but in the control vs. hsf-1;+hs samples. the heat map was organized using cluster <dig> by k-means and euclidean distance. c top processes normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs. the genes found in the light purple section of the venn diagram were classified by gene ontology terms that were determined using david the top <dig> genes that are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> under non-stress conditions are listed in table <dig> . surprisingly, a group of vitellogenin lipid transporter transcripts are among the top <dig> genes. vitellogenins are made in the intestine of late larval/early adult hermaphrodites and are taken up by the germ cells to provide nourishment to embryos <cit> . other top upregulated genes include acdh- <dig> which encodes a short chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase and may play a role in energy production <cit> ; k11g <dig> , which is predicted to be an ortholog of human butyrylcholinesterase; folt- <dig> which encodes a folate transporter <cit> ; ilys- <dig> which is predicted to have lysozyme activity; zc <dig> , which is predicted to have g-protein coupled receptor activity; fat- <dig> which encodes a fatty acid desaturase <cit> ; k10b <dig> , which is predicted to have carboxypeptidase activity; y52e8a. <dig> which encodes the ortholog to a major facilitator superfamily; ugt- <dig> which encodes the ortholog of a polypeptide predicted to have transferase activity; and two genes with unknown function. therefore, a diverse set of genes, including vitellogenins and others, are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs.table <dig> top <dig> genes normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs c55b <dig> acdh-1 f59d <dig> vit-3 f59d <dig> vit-4 c04f <dig> vit-5

characteristics of the top <dig> genes that are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of heat stress. the log2-fold changes of a subset of these top <dig> genes are plotted , and are compared to the expression of the same genes in the presence of hs and absence of hsf- <dig> . this data shows that hs does not affect the expression of these genes in the absence of hsf- <dig> the expression of these mrnas was also verified with qrt-pcr, and the results are consistent with the rna-seq data . to investigate a hs-independent role for hsf- <dig> in the induction of gene expression on a global level, we generated a heat map of all <dig> genes found via venn diagram to be normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> in the absence of hs . as a comparison, genes that are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> in the presence of hs are plotted . the transcripts in this group that are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> in the absence of hs remain upregulated or unchanged in the presence of hs, verifying the heat stress-independent induction of this gene group. we next used david to determine the top <dig> functional processes that are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs. we found that cuticle structure was again the gene category with the highest enrichment score , as was also the case for the genes that are upregulated by hsf- <dig> during hs . this indicates that hsf- <dig> may regulate the basal expression of genes involved in cuticle structure, and that these genes are then further induced upon hs. other functional processes, with enrichment scores less than <dig> include genes that encode proteins involved in the mitochondrial envelope, acyl-coa dehydrogenase activity, peptidase activity, and oxidoreductase activity. the complete output from david is also available . the mitochondrial envelope, acyl-coa dehydrogenase activity, peptidase activity, and oxidoreductase activity are all processes that can be linked to metabolism, further substantiating a functional role for hsf- <dig> in regulating this process. genes that are normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs we next examined the <dig> genes from the venn diagram that we determined to be upregulated in response to hsf- <dig> rnai independently of hs, suggesting that they are normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> . we reversed our data comparison to obtain the fold change, as this gene group is shown to be upregulated in response to hsf- <dig> rnai and would thus normally be downregulated by hsf- <dig> the top <dig> genes in this category are listed in table <dig> . there are a variety of transcript types in this list, including t22f <dig> , which is an mrna that encodes the ortholog of the human solute carrier family 17; eol- <dig> which regulates olfactory learning <cit> ; bo <dig> , which encodes an ortholog of human lipopolysaccharide-induced tnf factor; col- <dig> which encodes a structural constituent of the cuticle; fbxa- <dig> and t08e <dig> , which encode proteins that contain f-box motifs predicted to be important for protein-protein interactions; clec- <dig> and clec- <dig> which encode carbohydrate binding proteins; srg- <dig> which encodes a protein involved in embryo development; clec- <dig> which encodes a protein involved in the immune response; b <dig> , which encodes an ortholog of human cingulin-like 1; clec- <dig> which is predicted to have carbohydrate binding activity; f22f <dig> , which encodes an ortholog of human grb <dig> interacting gyf protein 2; and y47h10a. <dig> and zk <dig> , which both have unknown functions. overall, we find that a diverse set of mrnas are normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs, indicating that hsf- <dig> may normally suppress a variety of cellular processes in a hs-independent manner.fig. <dig> genes that are normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs. a the venn diagram shows the overlap among genes that were

<dig> . the expression of these mrnas was also verified with qrt-pcr, and the results are consistent with the rna-seq data . altogether, these data confirm that hs does not affect the expression of these genes in the absence of hsf- <dig> to investigate a hs-independent role for hsf- <dig> in the suppression of gene expression, we constructed a heat map of all <dig> genes found via venn diagram to be normally suppressed by hsf- <dig> in the absence of hs . as a comparison, the expression patterns of the same transcripts suppressed by hsf- <dig> in the presence of hs are shown . the transcripts in this group that are significantly downregulated by hsf- <dig> in the absence of hs remain downregulated or unchanged by hsf- <dig> in the presence of hs, further verifying that regulation of this subset of genes by hsf- <dig> is independent of hs. we next used david to determine the functional processes that are normally downregulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs. genes involved in cell cycle processes were most abundant, with an enrichment score of <dig> followed by genes involved in epithelium development, regulation of growth, genitalia development, and cell migration, all with enrichment scores under <dig> . the complete output from david is also available . cell cycle processes, epithelium development, regulation of growth, genitalia development, and cell migration are all processes that can be linked to development, thus confirming a hs-independent role for hsf- <dig> in development. discussion regulation of gene expression by hsf-1 c. elegans is a useful model organism for identifying regulatory processes that are shared between species. while the transcription factor hsf- <dig> has classically been studied as a factor that is responsive to cytoplasmic proteotoxic stress, it is becoming increasingly evident that this transcription factor also has major non-stress-induced roles in coordinating gene expression. with the rna-sequencing experiments performed here, we confirm that hsf- <dig> can regulate gene expression under both heat stress and non-stress conditions. in addition to genes that are classically stress-responsive, such as chaperones, our work shows that hsf- <dig> also regulates sets of genes involved in a variety of cellular processes including metabolism, development, and longevity. cuticle structure genes are normally upregulated by hsf- <dig> via hs-dependent and -independent mechanisms a surprising result of our study is that genes controlling cuticle structure comprise the largest gene ontology group that is upregulated by hsf- <dig> in both a hs-dependent and -independent manner. the c. elegans cuticle is an exoskeletal structure that creates a barrier between the animal and the environment, provides body shape, and allows movement via attachment to muscle. many of the genes in the cuticle structure category are collagens, structural proteins that form an extracellular matrix composing the exoskeleton, or cuticle, of the nematode. there are ~ <dig> distinct collagen genes in c. elegans, and they are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion and at distinct temporal times <cit> . cuticle structure is controlled by enzymes involved in collagen processing, and the polymerization pattern is dictated by actin filaments that are organized in specific patterns around the body of the worm. in humans, collagens comprise about one-third of all expressed protein <cit> . aside from the structural role of collagens, these genes can also participate in signal transduction . collagen genes were recently found to be upregulated by skn- <dig> the c. elegans oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor <cit> . in future work, it will be interesting to test whether collagen can act to relay signals to stress-specific transcription factors including skn- <dig> and hsf- <dig> roles for hsf- <dig> in regulating metabolism and development in a hs-independent manner although hsf- <dig> has classically been studied as a transcription factor that responds to hs and cytoplasmic proteotoxic stress, hsf- <dig> has recently been gaining importance as a transcription factor that is involved in non-stress processes including development and metabolism <cit> . in mice, hsf family members have been documented to be involved in diverse developmental processes, including oogenesis, spermatogenesis, and corticogenesis <cit> . hsf- <dig> in the worm has also been shown to be regulated by insulin/igf- <dig> tgf-β, and cgmp signaling to control development <cit> . the finding that mammalian hsf <dig> can be regulated by sirt <dig> a deacetylase that is under metabolic control, provides evidence that hsf- <dig> and metabolism are linked <cit> . this finding is also true for c. elegans hsf- <dig> as the sirt <dig> homolog sir- <dig> regulates the c. elegans hsr <cit> . additionally, the insulin-like signaling regulators ddl-1/ <dig> have been linked to hsf- <dig> regulation <cit> . here, we show that under non-stress conditions, hsf- <dig> regulates a number of genes involved in developmental and metabolic processes. therefore, our work further highlights the links between hsf- <dig> and these non-stress processes. network analysis identifies a nuclear hormone receptor as a common link between processes regulated by hsf- <dig> upon hs to determine how the genes regulated by hsf- <dig> during hs may interact with each other, we performed network analysis using genes associated with the top go-terms as determined by david . we used the mimi plugin to integrate data from protein interaction databases to allow for the creation of interaction networks using the network-building software cytoscape. this analysis enabled us to identify interacting partners shared by at least two genes regulated by hsf- <dig> during hs. the transcripts induced by hsf- <dig> during hs are shown in red, while the transcripts downregulated by hsf- <dig> during hs are shown in blue, with the intensity of color correlating to the fold change. genes that are not colored were not found to be affected by hsf- <dig> during hs in our dataset, but are neighbors shared by at least two genes that were affected. we found network linkages between the processes of cuticle structure formation, translation, the response to stress, protein kinase activity, and transcription . interestingly, the nuclear hormone receptor nhr- <dig> is a common link between several of the hs-regulated processes that require hsf- <dig> including cuticle structure, translation, and the response to stress. nuclear hormone receptors comprise a class of ligand-gated transcription factors that bind to small molecule metabolites such as fatty acids, vitamins, and steroids to directly regulate gene transcription <cit> . they are thus well-poised to coordinate metabolism, development, reproduction, and homeostasis across diverse tissues. nhr- <dig> is broadly expressed in c. elegans and is located in eight head neurons, the sensory pvd neurons in the posterior lateral body wall, the pharynx, the intestine, the dorsal peri-vulva region, and the somatic gonad precursor cells <cit> . in future work, it will be interesting to test the role of nhr- <dig> and other nuclear hormone receptors in the hsr, and to see if it can contribute towards the coordination of this response across tissues.fig. <dig> network analyses of the top hsf-1-regulated processes. a predicted network regulated by hsf- <dig> during hs. genes associated with the top <dig> induced and suppressed processes in figs. 1c and 2c were used for analysis. b predicted network regulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs. genes associated with the top <dig> induced and suppressed processes in figs. 3c and 4c were used for analysis. for a and b, the color of each gene corresponds to the degree of hsf- <dig> regulation of the corresponding transcript. network analysis was done with mimi using the cytoscape platform. the uncolored genes were not affected by hsf- <dig> during or independently of hs in our dataset, but are neighbors shared by at least two genes that were affected in our dataset network analysis identifies a tyrosine kinase as a common link between various developmental processes regulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs to uncover c. elegans interaction networks associated with processes regulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs, we performed network analysis using genes associated with the top go-terms as determined by david . network linkages were found for genes involved in the mitochondrial envelope, peptidase activity, oxidoreductase activity, cell cycle processes, and epithelium development. we found that let- <dig> an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase <cit> , is predicted to interact with many of these transcripts. the egf pathway in c. elegans has been linked to multiple developmental pathways <cit> . this rtk may thus allow for signaling to hsf- <dig> during non-stress conditions to modulate developmental gene expression. interestingly, hsf <dig> null mouse embryonic fibroblasts are defective in both basal and egf-induced cell migration <cit> , so the link between hsf- <dig> and the egf signaling pathways may be conserved across species. it will thus be worthwhile in future work to test for the involvement of let- <dig> in the regulation of hsf- <dig> activity in c. elegans. hsf- <dig> impacts aging-regulated gene expression as hsf- <dig> has been implicated to play an important role in both aging and disease <cit> , we analyzed the role of hsf- <dig> in regulating age-associated transcriptional changes in our data-sets . by comparing the transcriptome profiles between young and old adult c. elegans, a previous study by budovskaya et al. identified <dig> genes to be differentially regulated upon worm aging <cit> . a venn diagram comparison of these <dig> age-regulated genes with those that we found to be regulated by hsf- <dig> during hs shows that <dig> aging-associated genes overlapped with our dataset . a complete list of genes shared between both data-sets is also provided . the functional processes regulated by this overlapping gene set were then determined via david analysis. cuticle structure was the largest functional category, with an enrichment score of <dig> . other gene categories, all with enrichment scores of <dig> or lower, include cuticle development, the response to stress, amine catabolic processes, carbohydrate binding, and membrane structure. network analysis performed on the <dig> overlapping genes shows that only a small subset of these genes are predicted to interact with each other .fig. <dig> age-regulated genes controlled by hsf- <dig> a the venn diagram shows the overlap among genes that are differentially expressed during aging and regulated by hsf- <dig> during hs. the venn diagram was made using genes previously found to be regulated

shows the overlap among genes that are differentially expressed during aging and regulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs. the venn diagram was made using genes previously found to be regulated

transcript corresponds to the degree of hsf- <dig> regulation. genes that are not colored were not affected by hsf- <dig> in our dataset, but are neighbors shared by at least two genes that were affected in our dataset next, a comparison between aging-associated genes and those we found to be regulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs was done. a venn diagram shows that <dig> aging-associated genes overlapped with our dataset . a complete list of genes shared between both data-sets is also provided . the functional processes regulated by this gene set was then determined via david analysis. cuticle structure was again the largest category, with an enrichment score of <dig> the other categories, with enrichment scores of <dig> or lower, include peptidase activity, c-type lectin, vitamin binding, and lifespan-associated processes . the transcriptional impact of these hsf- <dig> and aging-regulated genes that are independent of hs was then determined by network generation . interestingly, the interaction network of aging-associated genes regulated by hsf- <dig> independently of hs is four-fold larger than the network of aging genes that depend on hs. we thus conclude that hsf- <dig> may have a role in impacting longevity that can be separated from its role in stress responses. hsf- <dig> regulates collagen genes which may affect the aging process it is interesting that cuticle structure genes constitute the largest overlap with aging-related genes. in humans, mutations in collagens lead to a large number of heritable human diseases such as osteoporosis and musculoskeletal diseases <cit> . collagens are long-lived proteins known to accumulate damage during aging, leading to a decline in tissue health <cit> . also, type i collagens become resistant to proteolysis upon age <cit> , affecting their turnover. interestingly, mice expressing cleavage-resistant type i collagen go through an accelerated aging process <cit> . thus, cellular aging can be affected by the state of the extracellular matrix in mammals. recently, collagen production and extracellular matrix remodeling were determined to be essential for longevity in c. elegans. collagen may directly affect signaling processes associated with longevity in c. elegans, including signaling through skn- <dig> <cit> . we note that hsf- <dig> was also recently shown to regulate cytoskeletal integrity in a process that can influence stress resistance and longevity in c. elegans <cit> . thus, the linkage of both the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton to hsf- <dig> may provide a mechanism by which hsf- <dig> promotes longevity. CONCLUSIONS next generation sequencing has allowed us to uncover highly varied roles for c. elegans hsf- <dig> in both hs-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including roles in the regulation of development, cytoprotection, metabolism, and aging . network analyses show that under hs conditions, the nuclear hormone receptor nhr- <dig> may allow coordination of the hsf- <dig> response across tissues, while under basal conditions, the egf receptor let- <dig> may regulate a similar coordination. these findings warrant further studies in order to further understand the methods of cell non-autonomous signaling across tissues. a striking result shown here is that multiple genes involved in cuticle structure, including collagen genes, are enriched as hsf- <dig> targets in hs-dependent and -independent manners. as recent studies link collagen to cytoprotection and longevity, the regulation of collagen expression may be one method by which hsf- <dig> enhances lifespan. harnessing the ability of hsf- <dig> to regulate collagen could thus have broad appeal in the treatment of diseases of aging.",

    "prompt": "Provide a brief summary emphasizing patient outcomes. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND the problem of learning causal influences from passive data has attracted a good deal of attention in the past 30 years, and techniques have been developed and tested. the constraint-based technique for learning bayesian networks is a well-known method <cit> , and has been implemented in the tetrad package . this method orients edges which are compelled to be causal influences. another method for learning bayesian networks is the greedy equivalent search <cit> , which does not in itself distinguish which edges are compelled to be causal. however, post-processing of its resultant network can compel edges. both these strategies assume the composition property, which states that a variable z and a set of variables s are not independent conditional on t, then there exists a variable x in s such that x and z are not independent conditional on t <cit> . when t is the empty set, this property simply states if z and s are not independent then there is an x in s such that z and x are not independent. so, at least one variable in s much be correlated with z. however, if two or more variables interact in some way to affect z, there could be little marginal effect for each variable, and the observed data could easily not satisfy the composition property. furthermore, if interacting variables have strong marginal effects, the causal learning algorithms do not distinguish them as interactions, but only as individual causes. so, the standard methods for learning causal influences do not learn that causes are interacting to cause a target, and do not even discover causes that are interacting with little or no marginal effect. an important task then is to learn such interactions from data. a method that does this could be a preliminary step before applying a causal learning algorithm. this paper concerns the development of a new method that does this in the case of discrete variables. we first provide some examples of situations where discrete variables interact. interaction examples an example, which has recently received a lot of attention, is gene-gene interactions, called epistasis. biologically, epistasis describes a situation where a variant at one locus prevents the variant at a second locus from manifesting its effect <cit> . epistasis between n loci is called pure epistasis if none of the loci individually are predictive of phenotype and is called strict epistasis if no proper multi-locus subset of the loci is predictive of phenotype <cit> . epistasis has been defined statistically as a deviation from additivity in a model summarizing the relationship between multi-locus genotypes and phenotype <cit> . it is believed that much of genetic risk for disease is due to epistatic interactions . a single nucleotide polymorphism is a substitution of one base for another. genome-wide association studies investigate many snps, often numbering in the millions, along with a phenotype such as disease status. by investigating single-locus associations, researchers have identified over <dig> risk loci associated with <dig> common diseases and traits . however, these single-locus investigations would miss epistatic interactions with little marginal effect. another important example is the interaction of clinical or genomic variables with treatments to affect patient outcomes. for example, herceptin is a treatment for breast cancer patients which is effective for her2+ patients. so, herceptin and her <dig> status interact to affect survival. this is a well-known relationship. however, we now have large scale breast cancer and other datasets <cit> from which we can learn treatment-variable interactions that are not yet known. this knowledge will enable us to better provide precision medicine. as another example, we are now obtaining abundant hospital data concerning workflow. these data can be analysed to determine good personnel combinations and sequencing <cit> . statistical interactions in statistics, the standard definition of an interaction is a relationship where the simultaneous influence of two or more variables on a target variable is not additive. however, when we leave the domain of regression and deal with the type of non-linear discrete interactions discussed above, this definition is limited. for example, researchers have developed the noisy-or model to combine the effect of binary causes that are independently causing a binary target <cit> . we would not call this relationship an interaction; yet the rule for combining the individual effects is not additive. when variables combine to affect a target with no marginal effect , we definitely can say there is an interaction. figure <dig> shows bayesian networks illustrating these two disparate situations. we discuss bayesian networks further in the methods section. however, briefly a bayesian networks consists of nodes which represent random variables, edges between the nodes, and the conditional probability distribution of every variable given each combination of values of its parents. figure 1a shows a causal relationship with no marginal effects. that is, pz1|x1=0× <dig> + <dig> × <dig> +0× <dig> = <dig> pz1|x2= <dig> × <dig> + <dig> × <dig> + <dig> × <dig> = <dig> pz1|x3= <dig> × <dig> + <dig> × <dig> + <dig> × <dig> = <dig> . fig. <dig> on the left is a bayesian network representing a causal interaction with no marginal effects, and on the right is a bayesian network representing a causal interaction described by the noisy-or model by the symmetry of the problem, we see the same result holds for y. figure 1b shows a causal relationship developed with the noisy-or model. that model assumes each cause has a causal strength that independently affects the target. see <cit> for the details of the assumptions. in this case the causal strength of x is px = <dig> and the causal strength of y is py = <dig> . from these causal strengths, the noisy-or model computes the conditional probabilities of z as follows: pz1|x <dig> y1=1−1− <dig> − <dig> = <dig> pz1|x <dig> y2=1−1− <dig> = <dig> pz1|x <dig> y1=1−1− <dig> = <dig> pz1|x <dig> y2=1−1= <dig> the examples just shown are two extreme cases, providing us with clear examples of an interaction and a non-interaction. however, in general, there does not appear to be a dichotomous way to classify a discrete causal relationship as an interaction or a non-interaction. so, we propose a fuzzy set membership definition of a discrete interaction in the methods section. previous research on learning discrete interactions the problem concerning learning genetic epistasis from gwas datasets has recently inspired ample research on learning discrete interactions from high-dimensional datasets. researchers applied standard statistical techniques including logistic regression <cit> , and regularized logistic regression <cit> . however, many felt that regression may not work well at learning interacting loci because the assumptions in these models are too restrictive. so researchers applied machine learning strategies including modeling full interactions <cit> , using information gain <cit> , a technique called snp harvester <cit> , using relieff <cit> , applying random forests <cit> , a strategy called predictive rule inference <cit> , a method called bayesian epistasis association mapping <cit> , the use of maximum entropy <cit> , bayesian network learning , and bayesian network learning combined with information gain <cit> . a well-known new technique called multifactor dimensionality reduction <cit> was also developed. mdr combines two or more variables into a single variable ; this changes the representation space of the data and facilitates the detection of nonlinear interactions among the variables. mdr has been applied to detect epistatically interacting loci in hypertension <cit> , sporadic breast cancer <cit> , and type ii diabetes <cit> . jiang et al. <cit> evaluated the performance of <dig> bayesian network scoring criteria and mdr when learning two interacting snps with no marginal effects. using <dig> simulated datasets and a real alzheimer's gwas dataset, they found that several of the bayesian network scoring criteria performed substantially better than other scores and mdr. the bn score that performed best was the bayesian dirichlet equivalence uniform score, which is based on the probability of the data given the model. henceforth, we refer to a candidate cause as a predictor. the multiple beam search algorithm was developed in <cit> to discover causal interactions. mbs starts by narrowing down the number of predictors using a bayesian network scoring criterion to identify a best set of possible predictors. next it starts a beam from each of these predictors. it performs greedy forward search on this beam by adding the predictor that increases the score the most. it stops when no predictor addition increases the score. next mbs does greedy backward search on each beam by deleting the predictor that increases the score the most. it stops when no predictor deletion increases the score. the set of predictors discovered in this manner is a candidate causal interaction. however, if two predictors each have a strong individual effect, they will have a high score together and will therefore be identified as an interaction, even if they do not interact. mbs-igain <cit> resolves this difficulty. mbs-igain also used mbs to develop beams and uses bayesian network scoring to end the forward search. however, it uses information gain to choose the next predictor rather than adding the predictor that increases the score the most. in a comparison using <dig> simulated 1000-predictor datasets with <dig> interacting predictors involved in <dig> interactions, mbs-igain substantially outperformed nine epistasis learning methods including mbs <cit> , leap <cit> , logistic regression <cit> , mdr <cit> combined with a heuristic search, full interaction modeling <cit> , information gain alone <cit> , snp harvester <cit> , beam <cit> , and a technique that uses maximum entropy <cit> . methods mbs-igain requires some marginal effect to detect interactions containing more than two predictors. if the dataset is not high-dimensional, we can alleviate this difficulty by instead doing an exhaustive search while using the model selection criteria in mbs-igain. however, the exhaustive search is not straightforward because we must not only score each candidate model m, but also check the submodels of m to see how much information is provided if we do not combine them into m. we develop exhaustive-igain, which does this. we compare the performance of exhaustive-igain to mbs-igain using <dig> simulated 40-predictor datasets based on <dig> interactions with marginal effects, <dig> simulated 40-predictor datasets based on two predictors interacting with no marginal effects, <dig> simulated 40-predictor datasets based on <dig> predictors interacting with no marginal effects, and <dig> simulated 40-predictor datasets based on <dig> predictors interacting with no marginal effects. we use exhaustive-igain to learn interactions from a real clinical breast cancer dataset. since exhaustive-gain uses bayesian networks and information gain, we first review these. bayesian networks bayesian networks are an important architecture for reasoning under uncertainty in machine learning. they have been applied to many domains including biomedical informatics . a bayesian network represents a joint probability distribution by a directed acyclic graph g = , where the nodes in v are random variables and the edges in e represent relationships among the variables, and by the conditional probability distribution of every node x ∈ v given every combination of values of the node’s parents. the edges in the dag often represent causal relationship <cit> . a bn modeling causal relationship among variables related to respiratory diseases appears in fig. <dig> fig. <dig> a bayesian network representing the relationships among a small subset of variables related to respiratory illnesses using a bn, we can determine probabilities of interest with a bn inference algorithm <cit> . for example, using the bn in fig. <dig> if a patient has a smoking history , a positive chest x-ray , and a positive cat scan , we can determine the probability of the patient having lung cancer . that is, we can compute p. inference in bns is np-hard <cit> . so, approximation algorithms are often employed <cit> . learning a bn from data concerns learning both the parameters and the structure . in the score-based structure-learning approach, a score is assigned to a dag based on how well dag model g fits the data. the bayesian score <cit> is the probability of the data given g. this score, which uses a dirichlet distribution to represent prior belief concerning each conditional probability distribution in the bn, follows: scorebayesg:data=pdata|g=∏i=1n∏j=1qiΓk=1riaijkΓk=1riaijk+k=1risijk∏k=1riΓaijk+sijkΓaijk where n is the number of variables in the model, ri is the number of states of xi, qi is the number of different values that the parents of xi can jointly assume, aijk is a hyperparameter, and sijk is the number of times xi assumed its k th value when the parents of xi assumed their j th value. when aijk = α/riqi, where α represents a prior equivalent sample size, we call the bayesian score the bayesian dirichlet equivalent uniform score <cit> . it has been shown that the problem of learning a bn dag model from data is np-hard <cit> . resultantly, heuristic search algorithms have been developed <cit> . information gain, interaction strength, and interaction power information theory <cit> concerns the quantification and communication of information. given a discrete random variable z with m alternatives, the entropy h is defined as follows: h=−∑i=1mplog2p. if we repeat n trials of the experiment having outcome z, then it is possible to show that the entropy h is the limit as n → ∞ of the expected value of the number of bits needed to report the outcome of every trial. entropy provides a measure of our uncertainty in the value of z in the sense that, as entropy increases, it takes more bits on the average to resolve our uncertainty. entropy achieves its maximum value when p = 1/m for all zi, and its minimum value when p = <dig> for some zj. the expected value of the entropy of z given x is called the conditional entropy of z given x. we denote conditional entropy as h. mathematically, we have hz|x=∑j=1khz|xjpxj, where x has k alternatives. knowledge of the value of x can reduce our uncertainty in z. the information gain of z relative to x is defined to be the expected reduction in the entropy of z given x: ig=h−h. let ig denote the information gain of z relative to the joint probability distribution of x and y. the interaction strength of x and y relative to z as then defined as follows: iszxy=igzxy−igzx−igzy. let ig denote the information gain of z relative to the joint distribution of all variables in set a. the is of variable x and set of variables a is then defined as follows: iszxa=igzxa−igzx−igza. since a is a set, a ∪ {x} should technically be used in the ig expression. however, we represent this union by x, a. interaction strength provides a measure of the increase in information gain obtained when x and a are known together relative to knowing each of them separately. when ig ≠ <dig> we define the interaction power of model m for effect z as follows: ipzm=mina⊂misz;m−a,aigzm=mina⊂migzm−igz;m−a−igzaigzm. since information gain is nonnegative, it is straightforward that ip ≤ <dig> if m is causing z with no marginal effects , the ip is <dig> we would consider this a very strong interaction. when the ip is small, the increase in ig obtained by considering the variables together is small compared to considering them separately. we would consider this a weak interaction or no interaction at all. jiang et al. <cit> show that if the variables in m are independent causes of z, then is≥ <dig> so, in situations we often investigate, the ip is between <dig> and <dig> and therefore satisfies the notion of a fuzzy set <cit> , where the greater the value of the ip the greater membership the model has in the fuzzy set of interactions. the is and ip can be used to discover interactions. in this next section we develop algorithms for learning interactions that use the is and the ip. interaction strength algorithms we present the multiple beam search information gain and exhaustive search information gain algorithms, which use information gain and bayesian network scoring to learn interactions. mbs-igain, which was previously developed in <cit> , does a heuristic search, while exhaustive-igain does an exhaustive search. figure <dig> shows algorithm mbs-igain. the score in algorithm mbs-igain is the bdeu score of the dag model that has the predictors in m being parents of the target z. the notation score indicates that y is the only parent of z. mbs-igain symbiotically uses the is and ig functions and a bayesian network scoring criterion. initially, the most promising predictors are chosen using the scoring criterion. a beam is then started from each of these predictors. on each beam, the predictor, which has the highest is with the set of predictors chosen so far, is greedily chosen. the search ends when either the is is small relative to the ig of the model , indicating that the ip would be small, or when adding the predictor decreases the score of the model. this latter criterion is included because we not only want to discover predictors that seem to be interacting, but we also want to discover probable models. on the other hand, the check for a sufficiently large is is performed because a set of snps could score very high as parents of z when there is no interaction. for example, if x and y each have strong causal strengths for z but affect z independently, the model with them as parents of z would score high. the noisy-or model <cit> is such a model. in this situation the model x → z ← y would have a high score without there being an interaction. finally, a parameter r, which puts a limit on the size of the model m learned, could be included in mbs-igain.fig. <dig> algorithm mbs-igain mbs-igain will miss a 3-predictor or 4-predictor pure epistatic interaction. when there are not many predictors, we can ameliorate this problem by doing an exhaustive search. algorithm exhaustive-igain, which appears in fig. <dig> does this. the parameter r is the maximum size of the interactions we are considering. for each set m of size between <dig> and r, the algorithm checks every subset a of m to see if the ratio of is to ig exceeds a threshold t. in this way it makes certain that the ip exceeds t. it also checks that m yields a higher score than both a and m-a. if m passes these tests for every subset, then m is considered an interaction.fig. <dig> algorithm exhaustive-igain reporting the noteworthiness of an interaction once we discover an interaction, we need to report its noteworthiness. first, we report its ip to indicate its strength as an interaction. however, if the model is unlikely, it is still not very noteworthy even if the ip is large. so, we also need to in some way report the significance of the model. standard p-values are not very informative because there is more than one null hypothesis. consider fig. <dig> which shows the dag model mxy in which x and y are both parents of z. the three competing models are on the right. model m <dig> represents that neither variable is a parent of z, model mx has x as a parent of z and y not as a parent of z, and model my has y as a parent of z and x not as a parent of z. standard statistical techniques do not investigate these multiple competing hypotheses. they only pit the null hypothesis m <dig> against mxy. however, if either model mx or my were the correct model, we would obtain an association of the two variables together with z even though mxy is incorrect. towards addressing this difficulty, jiang et al. <cit> developed the bayesian network posterior probability , which provides the posterior probability of a dag model that has an arbitrary number of parents of a target z. for the two-parent model mxy, the bnpp is as follows: pmxy|data=pdata|mxypmxypdata|mxypmxy+pdata|m0pm0+∑kpdata|mkpmk, where k sums over the two 1-predictor models. the bnpp extends to larger models, but the number of competing hypotheses grows exponentially with size of the model. however, in general, we usually don’t learn an interaction with more than <dig> predictors. jiang et al. <cit> discuss and provide prior probabilities in the case of interactions learned from gwas datasets.fig. <dig> the model that x and y are both parents of z is on the left, and its three competing models are on the right evaluation methodology we evaluated exhaustive-igain by comparing it to mbs-igain using simulated datasets, and by applying it to a real breast cancer dataset. we discuss each of these next. simulated datasets one hundred simulated datasets based on interacting trinary variables causing a binary target were developed by chen et al. <cit> . they labeled the predictors snps and the target a disease. therefore, we will proceed with this terminology. each dataset had <dig> total snps, and consisted of <dig> cases and <dig> controls. the datasets were generated based on two 2-snp interactions, two 3-snp interactions, and one 5-snp interaction, making a total of <dig> causative snps. the effects of the interactions were combined using the noisy-or model <cit> . the <dig> interactions used to generate the datasets were as follows:s <dig> s <dig> s <dig> s <dig> s5 s <dig> s <dig> s8 s <dig> s <dig> s11 s <dig> s13 s <dig> s15 each of these <dig> interactions exhibits some marginal effect. as mentioned in the introduction section, mbs-igain <cit> previously outperformed <dig> other methods at interaction discovery using these <dig> datasets. we developed <dig> datasets based on these same interactions, but with only <dig> total snps. each dataset has <dig> cases and <dig> controls. urbanowicz et al. <cit> created gametes, which is a software package for generating pure, strict epistatic models with random architectures. we used gametes to develop 2-snp, 3-snp, and 4-snp models of pure epistatic interaction. that is, there are no marginal effects. the software allows the user to specify the heritability and the minor allele frequency . we used values of heritability ranging between <dig> and <dig> , and values of maf ranging between <dig> and <dig> . using these values, we generated <dig> datasets based on pure, strict 2-snp interactions, <dig> datasets based on pure, strict 3-snp interactions, and <dig> datasets based on pure, strict 4-snp interactions. the 2-snp and 3-snp based datasets contained <dig> cases and <dig> controls, and the 4-snp based datasets contained <dig> cases and <dig> controls. all the simulated datasets are available in additional file <dig> we used both mbs-igain and exhaustive-igain to analyze both sets of datasets. we ran both algorithms with all combination of the following values of the threshold t in the algorithms: t = <dig> , <dig> ; and the parameter α in the bdeu score: α = <dig> <dig> <dig> we compared the results using the following two performance criteria:criterion 1: this criterion determines how well the method discovers the predictors in the interactions, but does not concern itself with whether the method discovers the actual interactions. first, the learned interactions are ordered by their scores. then each predictor is ordered according to the first interaction in which it appears. finally, the power according to criterion <dig> is computed as follows: power1k=1h×m∑i=1hnki where nk is the number of true interacting predictors appearing in the first k predictors learned for the ith dataset, m is the total number of interacting predictors in all interactions, and h is the number of datasets. criterion 2: this criterion measures how well a method discovers each of the interactions. the criterion used the jaccard index which is as follows: jaccardab=#a∩b#a∪b. the jaccard index equals <dig> if the two sets are identical and equals <dig> if their intersection is empty. the criterion provides a separate measure for each true interaction. the learned interactions are first ordered by their scores for each dataset i. denote the jth learned interaction in the ith dataset by mj , and denote the true interaction we are investigating by c. for each i and j we compute jaccard,c). we then set jkic=max1≤j≤kjaccardmji,c. the power according to criterion <dig> for interaction c is then computed as follows: power2kc=1h×m∑i=1hjkic where h is the number of datasets and m is the total number of interacting predictors in interaction c. real dataset the metabric data set <cit> has clinical data and outcomes for <dig> primary breast cancer tumors. table <dig> shows the clinical variables and their values used in our analysis. the data in three of these variables were transformed from their original metabric values using domain knowledge and the equal distribution discretization strategy. the transformations follow:age_at_diagnosis: this variable was discretized to the five ranges shown using the equal distribution discretization technique and breast cancer expert knowledge. size: this variable was discretized to the three standard ranges shown. lymph_nodes_positive: this variable was grouped into the six ranges shown. the outcome variable is whether the patient died from breast cancer. if the person was known to die from breast cancer, the days after initial consultation that the patient died is recorded. if the person was not known to die from breast cancer, the days after initial consultation that the patient was last seen alive or died from another cause is recorded. if a patient was known to die from breast cancer within x years after initial consultation or is known to be alive x years after initial consultation, we say their breast cancer survival status is known x years after initial consultation. these data provide us with <dig> patients whose breast cancer survival status is known 5 years after initial consultation, <dig> patients whose breast cancer survival status is known 10 years after initial consultation, and <dig> patients whose breast cancer survival status is known 15 years after initial consultation. we used exhaustive-igain to learn interactions that affect 5 year, 10 year, and 15 year breast cancer survival. RESULTS simulated datasets based on marginal effects the results were similar for all combinations of the parameters, but best when t = <dig> and α = <dig> figure <dig> shows power <dig> for k ≤ <dig> for the exhaustive-igain and mbs-igain algorithms. figure <dig> shows power <dig> for k ≤ <dig> for each interaction c for the two methods. figure 7f shows the average of power <dig> over all <dig> interactions. it is initially surprising that mbs-igain does slightly better than exhaustive-igain according to power criterion <dig> and, on the average, according to power criterion <dig> these results can be attributed to the superior performance of mbs-igain for interaction {s <dig> s <dig> s <dig> s <dig> s5} and interaction {s <dig> s <dig> s11} . an explanation for this superior performance is as follows. mbs-igain, for example, could have s <dig> and s <dig> already chosen on a beam and be considering s <dig> next. the model {s <dig> s <dig> s11} is only checked for interaction strength relative to the models {s <dig> s10} and {s11}. so, if the information gain of {s <dig> s <dig> s11} satisfies a threshold relative to the sum of the information gains of {s <dig> s10} and {s11} , the model will be chosen. on the other hand, for exhaustive-igain to choose model {s <dig> s <dig> s11}, that model must also beat the sum of the gains for {s <dig> s11} and {s10} and the sum of the gains for {s <dig> s11} and {s9}. so, mbs-igain will more readily accept model {s <dig> s <dig> s11}. this is a property of these particular datasets, and should not indicate the mbs-igain performs better than exhaustive-igain when there are marginal effects. mbs-igain does a heuristic search, and the performance of a comparison to each combination of sub-models, as done by exhaustive-igain, has a more proper theoretical basis. note that the performances of the two methods are about the same in the case of the 2-snp models , when this phenomenon cannot occur.fig. <dig> comparison of exhaustive-igain and mbs-igain, when analysing the simulated datasets based on interactions with marginal effects, using performance criterion 1 fig. <dig> comparison of exhaustive-igain and mbs-igain, when analysing the simulated datasets based on interactions with marginal effects, using performance criterion 2 exhaustive-igain discovers on the average <dig> models and mbs-igain discovers on the average <dig> models. when there are <dig> snps, there about <dig> models containing between <dig> and <dig> snps. so, both methods exhibit the good discovery performance shown in figs. <dig> and <dig> with very few false positives. note that mbs-igain could discover at most <dig> models because there are only <dig> beams. simulated datasets based on pure, strict epistasis figure <dig> shows power <dig> for exhaustive-igain and mbs-igain for k ≤ <dig> for each of the three pure epistatic interactions.fig. <dig> comparison of exhaustive-igain and mbs-igain, when analysing the simulated datasets based on pure epistatic interactions with no marginal effects, using performance criterion 2 we see from fig. 8a that both methods discover the 2-snp interaction very well. in fact exhaustive-igain ranked the correct interaction first in <dig> of the datasets and 3rd in the remaining dataset, while mbs-igain ranks it first in <dig> of the datasets and 4th in the remaining dataset . in the case of a 2-snp interaction, mbs-igain effectively does an exhaustive search, explaining why it performs almost as well as exhaustive-igain. its slightly worse performance is due to its different exit criteria concerning the score. it stops adding predictors when no predictor increases the score. on the other hand, exhaustive-igain checks whether any sub-model has a higher score than the model being considered. exhaustive-igain achieves this performance with very few false discoveries. the average number of interactions discovered by exhaustive-igain is <dig> . on the other hand, the average number of interactions discovered by mbs-igain is <dig> . figure 8b shows that exhaustive-igain also discovers the 3-snp interactions extremely well, while mbs-igain exhibits poor performance. this poor performance is to be expected. that is, when there are no marginal effects, if {s <dig> s <dig> s3} is our interaction, s <dig> or s <dig> would be chosen first on the beam initiating from s <dig> only by chance. in general, exhaustive-igain exhibited this good performance with a low false positive rate. the average number of interactions discovered for <dig> of the datasets was <dig> . however, for one of the datasets, <dig> interactions were identified. as fig. 8c shows, exhaustive-igain performed well for the 4-snp interactions, but not as well it did for the smaller models. this result indicates that higher order interactions are more difficult to discover. as expected, mbs-igain again showed very poor performance. for <dig> of the datasets, the average number of interactions discovered by exhaustive-igain was <dig> . however, for two of the datasets, <dig> interactions were discovered. real dataset table <dig> shows the correlations of each of the predictors with breast cancer survival according to both the bnpp and pearson’s chi-square test. except for a few exceptions, the two methods are in agreement. our purpose here is not to discuss these correlations, but rather to provide them as a frame of reference for the learned interactions, which appear in table <dig> table <dig> the individual variable effects learned from the metabric dataset. the p-values were obtained using the chi-square test table <dig> shows the interactions learned from the metabric dataset that have ips > <dig> . the data indicates that histological interacts with menopausal_status to affect both 5 year and 15 year breast cancer death survival. a consultation with a breast cancer oncologist <dig> reveals that invasive ductal carcinoma has a worse prognosis in premenopausal women, but other histological types do not. furthermore, table <dig> indicates that neither histological nor menopausal status is highly correlated with 5 year or 15 year breast cancer death survival by themselves. table <dig> also shows that the data indicates hormone and menopausal_status interact to affect <dig> breast cancer death survival. the breast cancer oncologist indicated that hormone therapy is more effective in post-menopausal women. as table <dig> shows, neither hormone nor menopausal_status are highly correlated with 10 year breast cancer death survival by themselves. finally, table <dig> shows that the data indicates that histological and hormone interact to affect 5 year breast cancer death survival. the oncologist stated idc might respond slightly worse to hormone therapy than other types, but that this difference is not well-established. the bnpp is a relatively new concept, and the ip is a complete new concept. so, we do not have the same intuition for their values as we have for a p-value. that is, we have come to consider a p-value of <dig> meaningful partly due to fisher's <cit> statement in <dig> that “it is convenient to draw the line at about the level at which we can say: either there is something in the treatment, or a coincidence has occurred such as does not occur more than once in twenty trials,” and also due to years of experience. to provide a context for the results in table <dig> table <dig> shows the average bnpps and ips of all <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> predictor models obtained from the metabric dataset. as we would expect, the value of the bnpp decreases as the size of the models increases. however, the ip is small for models of all sizes. the models we learned are all 2-predictor models. so we compare those results to the averages for 2-predictor models. our ip results of <dig> , <dig> , <dig> and <dig> are all substantially larger than the 2-predictor ip average of <dig> . three of our bnpp results, namely <dig> , <dig> , and <dig> are much higher than the average 2-predictor bnpp of <dig> . however, the value of <dig> , which is obtained for {hormone, menopausal_status}, is not much higher than the average. yet, this model has the largest ip .table <dig> the average bnpps and ips of all <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> predictor models obtained from the metabric dataset CONCLUSIONS we compared exhaustive-igain to mbs-igain using simulated datasets based on interactions with marginal effects, and simulated datasets based on interactions with no marginal effects. mbs-igain performed as well as exhaustive-igain when analysing the datasets based on interactions with marginal effects. mbs-igain is o whereas exhaustive-igain is o, where n is the number of predictors and r is the maximum size of the models considered. so, our results indicate that mbs-igain achieves similar results to exhaustive-igain with this type of dataset, but much more efficiently. on the other hand, as could be expected, mbs-igain could not discover pure epistatic interactions involving more than two snps. exhaustive-igain performed very well at discovering 3-snp interactions, and reasonably well at discovering 4-snp interactions. we conclude from these results that the combined use of information gain and bayesian network scoring enables us to discover higher order pure epistatic interactions if we perform an exhaustive search. when we applied exhaustive-igain to a real breast cancer dataset to learn interactions affecting breast cancer survival, we learned interactions that agreed with the judgements of a breast cancer oncologist. we conclude that exhaustive-igain can be effective when applied to real data. abbreviations bdeu, bayesian dirichlet

    "prompt": "Write a summary of the research hypothesis and results. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND class i major histocompatibility complex molecules bind short peptides derived from the processing of proteins, and present them on the cell surface for t cell scrutiny. functional mhc molecules are made of a heavy chain and a β2-microglobulin chain. peptide binding by class i molecules is accomplished by interaction of the peptide amino acid side chains with discrete pockets within the peptide-binding groove of the mhc molecule formed by the α <dig> and α <dig> domains of the heavy chain. typically, in the case of human leukocyte antigen class i, the main binding energy is provided by the interaction of residues in position <dig> and the c-terminus of the peptide with the b and f binding pockets of the mhc molecule, respectively <cit> , although side chains throughout the ligand can have a positive or negative influence on binding capacity. the common chemical specificity of the peptide side chains amongst ligands bound by a specific mhc molecule is termed the binding motif <cit> . mhc molecules are extremely polymorphic, and over a thousand allelic variants have already been described at the class i a and b loci. most of the polymorphism is located in the peptide-binding region, and as a result each variant is believed to bind a unique repertoire of peptide ligands. despite this polymorphism, hla class i molecules can be clustered into groups, designated as supertypes, representing sets of molecules that share largely overlapping peptide binding specificity. each supertype can be described by a supermotif that reflects the broad main anchor motif recognized by molecules within the corresponding supertype. for example, molecules of the a2-supertype share specificity for peptides with aliphatic hydrophobic residues in position <dig> and at the c-terminus, while a3-supertype molecules recognize peptides with small or aliphatic residues in position <dig> and basic residues at the c-terminus. the first supertypes were described in the mid-1990's by our group <cit> . using motifs derived from binding data or the sequencing of endogenously bound ligands, along with simple structural analyses, nine different supertypes were defined <cit> . initial peptide binding studies allowed the identification of several peptides with degenerate binding capacity for the a2- <cit> , a3- <cit> and b7-supertypes <cit> . in subsequent years, additional binding data have been published to confirm the b44- <cit> , a1- and a24-supertypes <cit> . over time, a number of different and more sophisticated computational approaches have been implemented by others to classify hla class i alleles into clusters or supertypes <cit> . while in general agreement, additional supertypes, representing either sub-clusters of the original nine or completely novel groupings, have been proposed <cit> . despite differences in various classification schemes, the concept of hla supertypes has been effectively used to characterize and identify promiscuously recognized t cell epitopes from a variety of different disease targets, including measles-mumps-rubella <cit> , sars <cit> , ebv <cit> , hiv <cit> , kaposi' sarcoma associated human herpesvirus <cit> , hcv <cit> , hbv <cit> , hpv <cit> , influenza <cit> , p. falciparum <cit> , lcmv <cit> , lassa virus <cit> , f. tularensis <cit> , vaccinia <cit> , and also cancer antigens <cit> . supertypes have also been utilized as a component in several approaches and algorithms designed for predicting peptide candidates with degenerate hla class i binding capacity <cit> . finally, supertypes have also been examined as a variable in studies of disease association, rates of susceptibility, and outcome <cit> . the original classification proposed by sette and sidney <cit> comprised about <dig> different class i mhc alleles. however, over the last <dig> years, substantially more binding data has been generated, and through the efforts of several seminal mhc-related databases, including syfpeithi <cit> , hla ligand <cit> , fimm <cit> and mhcbn <cit> , mhc binding motif information is readily accessible. up-to-date compilations of mhc sequence data are also readily available in the imgt database <cit> . herein, we analyze the complete list of alleles available through imgt using a simple approach largely based on compilation of published motifs, binding data, and analyses of shared repertoires of binding peptides, in conjunction with clustering based on the primary sequence of the b and f peptide binding pockets. as a result, we now provide updated supertype assignments, with new assignments for about <dig> different hla-a and -b alleles. this will permit the use of our original classification scheme based on current data and its comparison to alternative supertype classification methodologies developed since then. RESULTS mhc sequences and peptide binding pockets α <dig> and <dig> chain residues comprising the b and f peptide-binding pockets of <dig> hla a and b class i molecules were extracted and aligned. based on crystallographic studies <cit> , residues <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> were considered as comprising the b pocket, which engages the peptide residue in position <dig> the residues comprising the f pocket, which engages the peptide c-terminal residue, were defined as <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> further, for the b pocket we defined the subset of residues <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> as key residues. in the f pocket, the key residues are those in positions <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> pocket chemical specificity next, we defined the broad chemical specificity associated with the different b and f pockets. table <dig> summarizes the amino acid residues generally associated with each particular description of binding specificity. the particular set of residues associated with each use of a descriptor may vary with context. while these descriptions largely follow classical textbook definitions, they also consider our own historical use and experience with peptide binding studies. for example, in our analyses we often consider the polar residue q along with more classically defined aliphatic residues based on observed behavior in mhc peptide binding studies <cit> . it is also important to note that some residues are assigned to multiple categories, as their chemical specificity is compatible with different emphases. for example, l would be considered as both aliphatic and hydrophobic. the chemical specificities defining each supertype are listed in table <dig> peptide-binding motif-based supertype assignments as a starting point, we have largely utilized the nine supertype designations derived previously <cit> , with a few exceptions. these exceptions entail specificities that appear to be compatible with multiple supertypes. more specifically, we recognize that some alleles have repertoires overlapping both the a <dig> and a <dig> supertypes , and others with the a01- and a24-supertypes . also, because it utilizes a non-canonical main anchor spacing, and as a result appears to have a repertoire that overlaps with other specificities, we have presently separated hla b* <dig> and other alleles sharing sequence and serological antigen similarities, as a separate cluster. while these b* <dig> alleles utilize a unique mode of peptide binding, it is likely that in most cases their repertoires overlap significantly with other supertypes, especially the b07-supertype . as a result, we have not defined this a separate supertype. next, the available peptide-binding motifs were compiled. in total, <dig> different class i motifs were identified. motif information was derived from our own peptide-binding studies, or from the published scientific literature as compiled in the syfpeithi database <cit> . the basis for each motif assignment is listed in tables <dig> and <dig> for hla-a and -b alleles, respectively. corresponding supertype associations were assigned based on the criteria listed in table <dig> pocket analysis and supertype assignments the amino acids comprising the b and f peptide binding pockets were compiled for all alleles for which complete sequence information was available. the positions of specific mhc residues forming the corresponding pockets are listed above. a reference panel of b and f pockets was generated to include all alleles for which the mhc-peptide binding specificity has been defined . these b and f pocket structures, along with the associated alleles and corresponding binding specificity are shown in tables <dig> and <dig> respectively. <dig> based on data presented in saper et al, and madden , the mhc residues utilized as constituting the b pocket are: <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> key residues are those in positions <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> <dig> based on data presented in saper et al, and madden , the mhc residues utilized as constituting the f pocket are: <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> key residues are those in positions <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> <dig> the key residue pockets dtld, dtlh and dtly are each associated with two different, although overlapping, specificity descriptions. in each case, one description is associated with hla b <dig> alleles, and in the other with hla a alleles. in assigning key residue matches, matches were assigned on the basis of corresponding locus. next, the b and f pocket structures of alleles whose peptide binding specificity was unknown were compared against the sequences in the reference panel. for each case, an attempt was made to find an exact match with the full set of residues in the corresponding pocket. if a match was identified, the allele was assigned the associated specificity shown in tables <dig> and <dig> if an exact match could not be found, then a match with a key residue sequence was attempted. if no match was identified, the allele was considered unassigned. for each allele where a match for the full or, secondarily, key residue sequence could be identified for both the b and f pockets with any of the alleles indicated in tables <dig> and <dig> a corresponding hla supertype was assigned. of the <dig> sequences analyzed, matches at both b and f pockets were found for <dig> . notably, for the majority of alleles not in the reference panel full sequence matches were identified at both the b and f pockets. figures <dig> and <dig> indicate the alleles associated with each hla-a or -b supertype, respectively. conversely, as an index, additional file <dig> provides the supertype assignment for each of the <dig> hla-a and -b alleles examined, along with their respective b and f pocket structures. at the hla-a locus, alleles were fairly evenly distributed amongst the four supertypes we have defined. considering the alleles with broad, or dual, specificity , the minimum was <dig> alleles for a <dig> and the maximum was <dig> alleles for a <dig> <dig> alleles were assigned to the a <dig> supertype, and <dig> to the a <dig> supertype. at the hla-b locus, the b07-supertype is the largest, with <dig> members. <dig> alleles were associated with the b <dig> pattern. as noted above, we hypothesize that alleles in this cluster will likely cross-react with other supertypes , so we do not consider this group as a distinct supertype. the b <dig> supertype was assigned only <dig> alleles, making it the smallest supertype. novel supertypes could not be identified, but several alleles have specificities spanning two different supertypes from tables <dig> and <dig> it is evident that not all possible combinations of b and f pocket specificities are present within the reference panel. for example, there are no alleles associated with a preference for acidic residues in position <dig> and basic residues at the c-terminus. hence, we were interested to see if combinations not found in the original supertype assignments were revealed in the present analysis. interestingly, we did not identify any new combinations. it is possible that new specificities will be identified from amongst the set of <dig> alleles for which pocket matches could not be obtained. however, we also note that in the majority of these cases, matches could be made if one allowed a single conservative residue change . thus, based on the analyses done to date, it would appear that the set of supertype specificities currently identified will cover virtually all hla-a and -b class i mhc alleles. in addition to a* <dig> and a* <dig> the present analysis has identified <dig> alleles expected to have a specificity overlapping two supertypes. nine alleles matched pocket preference patterns that would be compatible with both the a01- and a03-supertypes, and another <dig> with the a01- and a24-supertypes. in the former case, the association was established on the basis of pocket matches with a* <dig> not surprisingly, several, but not all, of the alleles assigned the a01–a <dig> specificity also share the a <dig> antigen. the a01–a <dig> cross-reactivity pattern was established on the basis of pocket matches with a* <dig> all of the alleles associated with the a01–a <dig> pattern also shared the a <dig> antigen. unexpected supertype assignments typically, the supertype assignment for a particular allele follows the predominant assignment for other alleles sharing the same serological antigen. with this in mind, we did identify several instances where the current classification differed from what was expected based on serology or previous classification . of these, the more striking ones involve alleles for which the assigned supertype represents a non-conservative change in the binding specificity from what would have been expected. for example, a* <dig> and a* <dig> which are associated with the a <dig> serological antigen, and thus might be expected to have an f pocket specificity for hydrophobic/aliphatic residues, were found to have an f pocket matching that of a <dig> supertype alleles, which have a specificity for positively charged residues. similarly, b* <dig> and b* <dig> were found to have b <dig> supertype b pockets, associated with a preference for positively charged residues, when a b <dig> supertype specificity for acidic residues might have been expected. <dig> expected based on serological association. as noted above, in the present analysis, and contrary to what was done in the original analysis, we did not make supertype assignments for alleles without an exact or key match by considering conservative substitutions. as a result of this more conservative approach, we now no longer assign supertypes to some alleles previously given a supertype designation . in the majority of these cases, however, the original designation would still seem to be a reasonable assumption. discussion in the present study we have attempted to classify almost <dig> hla-a and -b class i alleles into supertypes. this is nearly a 10-fold increase in the number of alleles compared to our original classification done about a decade ago <cit> . besides providing supertype assignments for considerably more alleles, the present report has attempted to make more transparent how the original \"phenomenological\" classifications were done. about 80% of the <dig> alleles examined were classified into one of the nine supertypes identified previously. analysis of b and f pocket specificity patterns did not suggest the existence of any novel supertypes. hla supertypes do not necessarily demarcate groups of alleles with completely non-overlapping repertoires. a binding repertoire overlapping multiple supertypes has been demonstrated previously, for example, in the cases of a* <dig> <cit> and a* <dig> . in the present study we have identified <dig> other alleles that would appear to have specificities that bridge either the a <dig> and a <dig> supertypes, or the a <dig> and a <dig> supertypes. at the same time, individual peptides can be readily identified that bear a particular supermotif, but that do not bind individual hla allele members of the supertype, or that bind alleles of other supertypes, even supertypes associated with a different locus. typically, in the first case, these phenomena result from differences in motif compatibility, perhaps at secondary positions. the second case likely reflects overlap between the supertypes in terms of specificity, although in rare cases binding can be accomplished when no main anchor motif compatibility is apparent. these observations are exemplified by a large scale analysis of the capacity of a non-redundant set of <dig> known ebv and hiv derived epitopes to bind a panel of <dig> different hla class i a and b molecules . it was found that about 21% of the peptides bearing a specific supermotif bound a given allele in the corresponding supertype with an affinity of <dig> nm, or better. by contrast, only in 1% of the cases considered did an allele bind a peptide that did not have the corresponding supermotif. at the same time, it was noted that in the set of peptides utilized 62% have motifs associated with <dig> or more supertypes. the pattern of binding also followed this general promiscuity. it is also significant to note that when the same library of peptides was examined for recognition in hiv/ebv patients, it was found that ~95% of the epitopes were recognized in individuals not expressing the allele the epitope was originally reported to be restricted by, and the promiscuity more often than not involved an allele outside of the supertype associated with originally described restricting allele <cit> . thus, it is apparent that the lines of demarcation between supertypes can be fuzzy from the perspective of both the allelic specificity and the peptide motif. restriction outside or across supertypes can also originate from overlaps in supermotifs , or for alleles such as b* <dig> which do not utilize the typical p2/cterminus anchor spacing. b* <dig> utilizes p <dig> and p <dig> not p <dig> and as such may be compatible with several supertypes and alleles. thus, an a02- or a24-supertype epitope cross-reacting with b* <dig> is not an example of a motif \"failure\", but merely reflects the fact that the specific peptide has both motifs. it is important to emphasize that supertypes are based on mhc binding, and that mhc binding alone is not sufficient criteria for t cell recognition. indeed, hundreds of examples of peptides that bind with remarkably high affinity, but that are not recognized by t cells, have been reported in the literature. we note that even in the best affinity ranges , rarely more than 10% of the peptides can be expected to be recognized <cit> . similarly, binding affinity is not necessarily correlative of frequency of recognition <cit> . it is true that the trend is towards the most frequently recognized peptides being also the highest affinity binders <cit> , but that is not always the case, and there are clearly cases where the dominant epitope has an ic <dig> of ~ <dig> nm, while several other non-recognized peptides have affinities in the < <dig> nm range. it must also be emphasized that membership of an epitope in a supertype is not sufficient to guarantee its recognition by t cells in the context of different mhc alleles. peptide binding to mhc is an absolute requirement for an epitope to be recognized by t cells. at the same time, many other factors, including protein expression and processing, as well as t cell repertoire and the specific mhc context, come into play in determining whether a peptide will be an epitope or not, or whether an epitope will be promiscuously recognized within a specific supertype. for example, goulder and co-workers, studying b7-supertype epitopes, found that differential selection pressure exerted on hiv by ctl targeting identical epitopes, but restricted by distinct hla alleles from the same supertype, can result in significant functional differences <cit> . macdonald et al., looking at two b <dig> subtypes described as members of the hla b44-supertype, reported that a naturally selected dimorphism between the two molecules alters class i structure, peptide repertoire, and t cell recognition <cit> . the intent of the current study was to derive an updated classification of hla class i mhc alleles on the basis of primary anchor specificity. for the vast majority of hla class i molecules whose binding specificity have been described by crystal structure, pool sequencing or peptide binding studies, the main anchor interactions of the peptide almost invariably involve the mhc b and f pockets, while other pockets likely dictate secondary interactions. this pattern also appears to be true for most macaque and chimpanzee class i alleles studied to date. there are exceptions, however, and indeed we have not assigned b* <dig> alleles to a specific supertype in recognition of the fact that these alleles appear to utilize pockets other than the b pocket as a primary anchor contact. for hla class i molecules in general, the b and f pockets are the most likely main anchor contacts, while other pockets likely dictate secondary interactions. high levels of crossreactivity have been experimentally demonstrated in the case of <dig> supertypes for alleles that vary at secondary pockets <cit> . by contrast, in the murine system it is well recognized that other pockets are often the important primary peptide contacts <cit> . thus, to utilize the classification approach described here in the context of other species, additional pockets may need to be considered. it is also likely that the further parsing or sub-classifying of supertypes on the basis of secondary interactions can be accomplished. in the case of hla-b alleles, f pocket specificity is difficult to correlate with a specific sequence, as a diverse pattern of residues appears to be associated with similar binding specificity. independent of the residues in the f pocket, most hla-b alleles seem to bind hydrophobic residues. thus, assignment of b alleles was primarily driven by the specificity exhibited by the b pocket. on the other hand, it is also possible that greater resolution in the f pocket could be achieved as more data become available to discriminate different preference patterns. for example, in the b <dig> supertype it is apparent that some alleles, like b* <dig> prefer large hydrophobic residues, such as y. conversely, other b <dig> supertype alleles, such as b* <dig> seem to prefer small hydrophobic residues, such as a, at the c-terminus. while we have noted these subtle differences in preference <cit> , in practice we have not found that they significantly impact cross-reactivity between the alleles. this perhaps suggests that the c-terminal anchor in some contexts is less important, and that shared secondary preferences can have a stronger influence on degenerate binding capacity than in other cases. at the same time, it may be necessary to consider additional key residues in the analysis of the f pocket. this is exemplified in the cases of a* <dig> and a* <dig> which have the same key f pocket residues, but which are associated with much different specificity. the vast majority of hla-a and -b alleles fall into one of the <dig> supertypes we have described. there are likely reasons for this <cit> , which include evolutionary relationships, but also constraints and limitations inherent in the epitope processing infrastructure. for example, no allele has been identified to date that binds peptides with d, e, q or p at the c-terminus, which is in congruence with the preferences of both proteasomal cleavage and tap transport <cit> , and an observation that has been applied in the rational design of an in vitro test reagent tool offered as a tool by the los alamos hiv sequence database <cit> . supertype classification should not be taken to necessarily imply an evolutionary relationship. in some cases this is largely true, as for example in the case of the a2-supertype, where most alleles are associated with the a <dig> serological antigen. in other cases the relationship is more complicated, such as the gene conversion relationship between the a <dig> a <dig> and a <dig> antigens. this latter example is somewhat of the exception that proves the rule. supertype associations are based on shared binding specificity, which may result from both common ancestry and convergent evolution <cit> . thus, while alleles within a supertype may have a close evolutionary relationship, that is not a given. also, alleles sharing specificity at one anchor position may be associated with very disparate specificities at the other. other groups have also utilized various methodologies to define supertypes. in general, our classification is in agreement with those derived by other approaches, as compiled by hertz <cit> , lund <cit> and tong <cit> . this is not surprising given the good agreement observed between our initial dataset and other classifications, and that the methodology utilized here is not different from the one utilized to derive the original assignments. if there are variations, they usually represent the splitting of a supertype, or reassignment of individual alleles. as in any classification problem of this kind, there is no absolute truth in supertype assignments. the practical application of supertype classification schemes to identify degenerately binding peptides will ultimately show what classification scheme has the most practical value. CONCLUSIONS the present study represents an update to the hla class i supertype classification originally described almost a decade ago. using mhc peptide binding motif data and mhc sequence information that has since become available, supertype associations have now been provided for over <dig> hla-a and -b alleles. in addition, the approach utilized has been made more transparent, allowing others to utilize the classification approach going forward.",

    "prompt": "Capture the essential diagnostic criteria in a short summary. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND transcriptional regulation provides an ideal target for therapeutic intervention. as such, tools for studying transcriptional modulators of disease genes will help to facilitate the development of novel therapeutics <cit> . cell lines have been used to study the expression of specific genes involved in disease development or at signal transduction checkpoints, and are currently a front-line approach for early-stage drug discovery. a number of indirect techniques are available to assess gene transcription in cells including elisa and gene arrays or quantitative pcr for measuring the gene transcript levels. however, these methods are time consuming, resource intensive and/or do not directly assess the transcriptional activity of an endogenous promoter. moreover, they are not amenable to high-throughput screening for efficient detection of drug-induced changes in disease gene expression. cell-based gene reporter assay systems were developed as an alternative system amenable to hts over <dig> years ago, and have been widely used to study transcription and gene regulation. specifically, linking easily detectable reporter genes – such as luciferase, β-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein – to defined gene promoters and regulatory elements has resulted in the production of numerous reporter vectors. transient transfection of such reporter vectors into cultured cells and quantitative analysis of the reporter gene product is a fast and efficient way to study disease gene expression. moreover, the establishment of cell lines containing random stable integrants has made possible the development of cell-based reporter assays <cit> , which have now been successfully scaled-up for hts following advances in robotics and fluorescence/luminescence plate-reader technologies <cit> . recently, a novel reporter system was developed in which flp recombinase is used to produce flippase recognition target single site-specific integration of a reporter gene construct at a transcriptionally-active genomic locus in cultured cells <cit> . this approach has several advantages over randomly integrated reporter constructs including single copy construct integration and a single chromatin context within which the effects of promoter mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms on gene expression can be studied <cit> . moreover, this reporter system has been used to screen small molecules for inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor <cit> . although randomly integrated and frt single site-specific reporters are presumed to reflect endogenous regulation of the disease gene, this is a questionable assumption given the unknown epigenetic influences of chromatin structure on gene transcription along with missing genetic elements that regulate gene expression at the endogenous locus. to this end, optimal systems would utilize gene-targeted reporters controlled by endogenous regulatory sequences and governed by an inherited epigenetic program unique to a given disease gene locus. although gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells makes it possible to precisely integrate exogenous dna sequence into a predetermined 'target' gene locus <cit> , such systems have been much less effective in somatic cells. an alternative approach, utilizing single-stranded recombinant adeno-associated virus to promote homologous recombination between the targeting construct and the chromosome <cit> has been widely applied to genetically modify endogenous genes by insertion, deletion/replacement, and point mutation <cit> . the efficiency of gene targeting using single-stranded raav vectors is also much higher than that observed with adenovirus- or retrovirus-based vector systems <cit> . self-complementary raav vectors have been shown to promote more efficient viral transduction than single-stranded raav vectors both in vitro and in vivo <cit> . however, these double-stranded vectors do not appear to contribute to the gene targeting reaction <cit> . the tnf-α gene maps to chromosome 6p <dig> , contains four exons, and spans approximately <dig> kb of dna in human cells <cit> . tnf-α gene expression is cell type-specific and induced by a wide variety of stimuli such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and lipopolysaccharide <cit> . the tnf-α protein is a multifunctional cytokine, and is involved in the regulation of a broad spectrum of biological processes <cit> . the tnf-α gene appears to be silenced in hela cells, as evidenced by undetectable levels of mrna by northern blot and protein by elisa <cit> . in the present study, we sought to engineer a hela cell line containing a targeted luciferase reporter in exon <dig> of the tnf-α gene. we also sought to compare the patterns of renilla luciferase induction with endogenous tnf-α mrna transcription between targeted and non-targeted cell lines in response to drug treatment. the production of a tnf-α gene-targeted reporter cell line will provide a sensitive and more predictive analytical tool for identifying molecules that modulate tnf-α gene transcription. RESULTS an raav targeting vector was generated to facilitate fusion of the renilla luciferase reporter gene to the tnf-α gene locus in hela cells . the vector harbors a <dig> kb genomic dna fragment from the tnf-α locus, which was split into left and right homologous arms by the insertion of a r-luc cdna and loxp sites that flank a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter-driven zeocin expression cassette. the insertion site in exon <dig> is immediately downstream of the tnf-α start codon, fusing the r-luc gene in-frame to the tnf-α transcript. since the left homologous arm of the targeting vector encodes the tnf-α core promoter and contains other regulatory elements necessary for initiation of transcription, we are able to compare reporter expression profiles between the targeted and non-targeted cell lines, the latter of which are derived from the random integration of av.tnf-rl.targ in hela cells. a zeocin-resistant gene serves as a selectable marker for clonal expansion of cells in which the raav genome has been stably integrated. enrichment of stably integrated cells is required for this type of insertional gene targeting. hela cells were infected with av.tnf-rl.targ and re-plated for clonal expansion under zeocin selection. zeocin-resistant colonies were picked and transferred to replicate 96-well plates. cells in replica plates were lysed for pcr screening with two sets of primers, which hybridize to sequences outside the right and left targeting arms and inside the exogenous insert. clone # <dig> was identified as a positive targeted clone, from <dig> clones screened, and its left-side pcr product was cloned into the pblunt4pcr vector for sequence confirmation. sequencing results revealed the presence of both the non-virus-derived flanking sequences and the expected in-frame fusion of the r-luc cdna in the tnf-α gene . this positive clone was expanded and the genomic dna was analyzed by digestion with several restriction enzymes . genomic dna from parental hela cells was used for comparison . the southern blot was probed with tnf-α left arm-homologous sequences. the additional bands observed in the digested tg#28zeor samples are indicative of targeted insertion of the r-luc cdna at the tnf-α gene locus. no additional random vector integration was observed . the exogenous pgk promoter and transcription of the zeocin gene could affect the transcriptional activity of the targeted tnf-α gene. to eliminate any possible artificial induction in r-luc activity, the selection cassette was removed from the targeted intermediate, tg#28zeor . flanked by a pair of loxp sites, the pgk-zeocin cassette can be easily excised from the targeting aav genome. cre recombinase-mediated excision was used to remove this selection cassette from the targeted tg#28zeor line and also from the non-targeted cell lines that harbor random integrations of the targeting virus. a recombinant adenoviral vector, ad.cre, was used to deliver cre recombinase to the cells. southern blot analysis with probes for tnf-α and pgk/zeo demonstrated that ad.cre infection resulted in loss of the selection cassette from the targeted intermediate, producing the final tnf-α reporter cell line, tg#28zeo- . individual clones expanded from a single cell were isolated from the zeocin-sensitive cell pool by limited dilution. five independent lines were randomly selected and basal levels of r-luc expression among these was compared. no apparent differences were observed between individual tg#28zeo- lines, and the expression levels were very similar to that in the original cell pool . however, basal r-luc activity in the targeted intermediate was more than 300-fold higher than in the clones lacking the zeocin selection cassette . thus, as predicted, this selection marker enhanced transcription from the tnf-α gene locus, arguing that r-luc activity in tg#28zeo- cells should more closely reflect endogenous tnf-α gene regulation than reporter activity in tg#28zeor cells. current tnf-α reporter vectors contain only about <dig> kb of core promoter located upstream of the tnf-α gene . in addition, these plasmid-based tnf-α/reporter constructs are randomly inserted into the host cell genome following transfection. in theory, the fidelity of tnf-α gene expression in these randomly integrated reporter cell lines may be influenced by missing regulatory sequences not part of the <dig> kb core promoter of the tnf-α gene <cit> . indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that the regulation of tnf-α expression involves distal enhancers located over a <dig> kb region, and that these enhancers interact to form a novel double-loop chromatin configuration. this structure circularizes the tnf-α gene and thereby facilitates transcription <cit> . moreover, epigenetic regulation is important for the control of tnf-α transcription <cit> and key epigenetic modifications at the tnf-α locus may be missing from the regulatory elements governing reporter expression in the randomly integrated reporter cell lines. in addition to the lack of intact endogenous regulatory elements and epigenetic modifications associated with the self-contained tnf-α core promoter/reporter gene, expression of the randomly integrated reporters is very likely to be influenced by both genetic and epigenetic features associated with the insertion site, in a very unpredictable manner. thus, we hypothesized that the tnf-α gene would be an ideal platform to test whether targeted reporter expression more closely reflects endogenous gene expression patterns than randomly integrated reporters. to test this hypothesis, we isolated <dig> non-targeted tnf-α/r-luc reporter clones in which the pgk-zeocin cassette had been excised by ad.cre infection. we then compared basal r-luc activity in the targeted and non-targeted reporter lines. activity varied widely among the non-targeted lines relative to that in the targeted line. four non-targeted lines representing the range of basal r-luc activity were selected for additional comparison to the tg#28zeo- targeted clone . tnf-α mrna was purified from the reporter lines and quantified by taqman pcr . basal tnf-α mrna levels were similar in all of the ntg lines, whereas the level in the tg line was somewhat lower. reduced expression in the tg line was most likely due to the disruption of one tnf-α allele as a consequence of the in-frame insertion of the r-luc cdna. tg and ntg cell lines were then treated with known inducers of tnf-α expression. drugs representing different activation pathways were used: the protein kinase c activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate <cit> ; the dna topoisomerase ii inhibitor doxorubicin <cit> ; the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a <cit> ; and the dna methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine <cit> . the extent of drug-induced reporter activity varied dramatically among the ntg cell lines tested – ranging from little or no induction to an induction profile similar to that in the tg cell line . however, even where such similarities existed, differences between the tg and ntg <dig> lines were apparent. drug-induced changes in tnf-α and r-luc mrna expression in the tg line were then quantitated by taqman pcr and compared with r-luc activity in the tg line . the induced patterns of both the tnf-α and r-luc mrnas closely reflected the patterns of r-luc protein activity following drug treatment, indicating that reporter expression accurately reflects endogenous tnf-α gene expression in the tg clone. throughout the approximately one-year study period, the basal level of r-luc activity remained low and the levels of pma- and tsa-induced reporter expression remained constant in the targeted cell line . however, we did not conduct a systematic analysis of drug-induced reporter activity at regular intervals during this time. nevertheless, while the long-term affects from integration of reporter gene sequences are unknown, our data do not indicate a progressive transcriptional silencing of the r-luc gene. we next probed potential regulatory differences between tg and the ntg cell lines further by investigating their responsiveness to <dig> -dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid <cit> . this is an agent that induces vascular permeability and tumor cell death in human solid tumors by activating tnf-α transcription <cit> and is currently in phase ii clinical trials <cit> . at a fixed drug concentration, dmxaa-induced r-luc activity was observed in the tg cell line but not in any of the tested ntg cell lines . in dmxaa dose-response studies, r-luc activity was induced in the tg line by as much as ~10-fold, while induction in the ntg <dig> line was insignificant . this differential drug-based induction was not due to cell line-dependent differences in cellular toxicity . moreover, little to no difference was observed when comparing the up-regulation of tnf-α mrna following dmxaa treatment in the tg and ntg <dig> lines . these data suggest that the <dig> kb tnf-α core promoter region does not encode the dmxaa response element. anthracycline antibiotics are also known activators of tnf-α promoter transcription. dose-response studies with four closely related anthracycline antibiotics demonstrated a pronounced up-regulation of r-luc activity in the tg cell line at a drug concentration of <dig> μm . anthracycline exposure did not appear to significantly reduce cell viability in the tg line at this drug concentration . therefore, both tg and ntg <dig> cell lines were treated with anthracyclines at <dig> μm drug and assayed for r-luc activity. differential r-luc activity was evident between these cell lines, most notably following idarubicin treatment . indeed, idarubicin induced r-luc activity ~300-fold in the tg line, but only ~50-fold in the ntg <dig> line – representing a 6-fold difference in induction between the tg and the ntg <dig> cell lines. differential induction between tg and ntg <dig> cell lines was also observed following treatment with daunorubicin, doxorubicin and epirubicin. again, these differences were not due to differences in anthracycline-induced cell death in the tg and ntg <dig> cell lines . rather, we attribute the differences in r-luc reporter activity to unique genetic and/or epigenetic features of the endogenous tnf-α gene locus. we also conclude that targeted reporter cell lines may be superior tools for screening drugs that modulate the transcriptional activity of target genes. the use of such cell lines with biophotonic imaging as presented here may be extremely useful for multi-parameter hts to identify novel therapeutics. CONCLUSIONS we conclude that gene-targeted reporter cell lines may more accurately index endogenous gene expression to facilitate predictive cell-based screening for drug discovery.",

    "prompt": "Distill this medical abstract into few key sentences. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND protein-protein interactions are dominated by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and hydrophobic contacts across the interface <cit> . these local interactions have to be desolvated, densely packed, and hence deeply buried to make contribution to the binding free energy <cit> . this is why the energetically important hot spot residues in the interface tend to cluster into local regions with low solvent accessible surface area values <cit> . identifying these energetically important residues, which can offer useful information to protein engineering and better understanding of protein-protein interaction <cit> , is usually done by site-directed alanine mutagenesis. this experimental method mutates the target residue into alanine which only has a cβ heavy atom on its side-chain <cit> . a residue whose mutation results in a large binding free energy change is defined as a hot spot residue <cit> . many feature-based <cit> energy-based <cit> and even feature-and-energy-combined <cit> computational approaches have been proposed to address the hot spot prediction problem. almost all of these feature-based methods use sasa information of the residue as a critical feature in the prediction. a low sasa is necessary for a residue to be a hot spot residue; however, it is not sufficient, as a large number of non hot spot residues also have low sasa values. therefore, sasa is not effective for distinguishing between slightly buried residues—a large part of which are non hot spot residues—and deeply buried residues that are very likely to be hot spot residues. in this work, we introduce a new descriptor for protein atoms and residues. it is named “burial level”. in the definition of burial level, the buried immobilized water molecules are treated as an integral part of the protein complex. we show that our definition of residue burial level is nicely correlated to ∆∆g. a high burial level is not only in general necessary for hot spot residues but also more sufficient for them in comparison to sasa. in other words, most hot spot residues tend to have high burial level while most non hot spot residues are exposed or just slightly buried. we also define the burial level of atomic contacts and we determine the number of three types of buried interfacial atomic contacts at different burial level that are directly broken when the residue is substituted by alanine. the number of those deeply buried atomic contacts together with the burial level of the residue itself are further fed into svm as features to classify interfacial residues into hot spot residues or non hot spot residues. we name this svm-based model dbac since the features used are mainly based on the deeply buried atomic contacts. by applying our method to a data set of <dig> mutations, we achieve an f measure of <dig> under the hot spot definition of ∆∆g ≥ <dig> kcal/mol, which is better than other computational methods. we also conduct a detailed analysis of the features used in this work; and we find that hot spot residues tend to have significantly more deeply buried atomic contacts than non hot spot residues. methods data set our data set is collected by retrieving the experimental alanine mutagenesis data from the alanine scanning energetics database <cit> and other previously published works <cit> . we require that: the 3d structure of the wild-type protein complex is solved by x-ray crystallography and is reported in pdb <cit> , and the associated solvent information is also included in the pdb file. we do not consider protein-ligand interaction or protein-peptide interaction in this work; thus those interactions without an extended interface are excluded. the reason is that the interfaces of protein-ligand interactions are small and most interfacial residues are exposed in the solvent to a certain degree; thus the burial levels of the atoms are mostly very low and imply little information. the structural similarity of the complexes are tested by the ce algorithm <cit> . if the two chains of the two complexes have a significant similarity, their binding interfaces are further examined to ensure that there is no redundancy in the data set. furthermore, only mutations in the interface are considered. we used another version of this data set in our previous work <cit> , where the requirement that the mutations have to be in the interface was not applied. our data set in this work consists of <dig> mutations distributed in <dig> protein complexes. hot spot residues are usually defined by setting ∆∆g ≥ <dig> kcal/mol or ∆∆g ≥ <dig> kcal/mol. we prefer the second choice, as only a higher ∆∆g threshold can reflect the direct influence of the mutation. that is, the interfacial atomic contacts that are directly broken by the mutation are taken into consideration with more weights. under the ∆∆g ≥ <dig> threshold, there are <dig> hot spot residues and <dig> non hot spot residues in our data set. some researchers even suggested that a residue should have a ∆∆g higher than <dig> kcal/mol so as to have a strong impact on the binding of the two proteins <cit> . in practice, a lower value has to be considered in order to get enough data for statistical analysis <cit> . the data set is available at http:// <dig> . <dig> :8080/dbac data. feature generation burial level for an atom, residue or an atomic contact our definition of burial level is based on atomic contact graph. the atomic contact graph of a protein complex is an undirected graph with heavy atoms as nodes and atomic contacts as edges. the atoms in this graph are labeled as exposed or buried according to its sasa. if the sasa of an atom is not less than <dig> Å <dig> it is exposed, otherwise it is buried. sasa is calculated by the naccess software based on the lee-richards algorithm <cit> . all the exposed water molecules, which we consider as a part of the bulk solvent, are removed, while the buried water molecules are kept as a part of the complex. thus the oxygen atoms of the buried water molecules are a part of the atomic contact graph. the atomic contact is defined by a distance threshold and the voronoi diagram. voronoi diagram decomposes the 3d space into cells by assigning every point in the space to its nearest neighboring input site. here in this work, the input sites are the positions of the atoms in the complex structure. if two atoms’ voronoi cells are adjacent to each other, they are somehow “sheltering” each other. we define the atomic contact by adding an extra distance requirement to voronoi diagram. two atoms are considered to be in contact if they have a distance less than their van der waals radius plus the diameter of a water molecule and they share a voronoi facet. we actually used the delaunay diagram that is dual to voronoi diagram. two facet-sharing voronoi cells correspond to two connected points in the delaunay diagram. the delaunay diagram is calculated by using the qdelaunay program in qhull <cit> . this distance threshold, <dig> Å, is based on a water-free idea and it has been used in <cit> . in an atomic contact graph, the burial level of an atom is defined as the length of the shortest path from this atom to its nearest exposed atom. for example, the burial level of exposed atoms is <dig> and the burial level of their immediate buried neighbors is <dig> we calculate the burial levels by adding a pseudo node, which represents bulk solvent, to the atomic contact graph. this node is connected to all of the exposed nodes directly. then the burial level of any atom equals to the length of the shortest path from this atom to the pseudo node minus <dig> this is exactly the single-source-shortest-path problem and it can be solved using dijkstra’s algorithm <cit> . the reason for using a voronoi-diagram-combined definition of atomic contact is as follows. if only distance information is used, there will be many false atomic contacts in the atomic contact graph whose two atoms cannot contact with each other at all , and the atomic contact graph will be a trivial discretization of the euclidean distance between atoms, and the atom burial level will only depend on the distance of the atom to the surface of the complex, especially when a large distance threshold is used. adding voronoi diagram to the definition makes the burial level depend also on the organization of the atoms inside. intuitively, the burial level of atoms in a protein complex depends on the size of the protein complex. in general, the larger the protein complex is, the more deeply buried atoms there are. burial level also depends on the shape of the interacting proteins. for example, globular proteins and protein complexes generally have more deeply buried atomic contacts than those with other shapes. note that the calculation of burial level requires information on buried water molecules. in our previous work <cit> , we have systematically analyzed the contribution of water molecules to the calculation of burial level as well as to protein binding hot spots. the burial level of a residue is the average value of the burial levels of all atoms in the residue. for an atomic contact, if the burial levels of the two atoms are the same, the burial level of the atomic contact is taken as the burial level of the two atoms, otherwise it is defined as the smaller one of the two burial levels. the difference of the burial levels of two contacting atoms is at most one. there are some existing concepts that are related to burial level. in <cit> , the authors defined their concept of depth of an atom as the euclidean distance to the closest exposed atom or to the closest surface water molecule. there are even some sequence-based methods <cit> that are capable of predicting its value. this definition is only based on the euclidean distance and hence it cannot capture the contacts between atoms or the organization of the atoms. and the calculation of the shortest distance contains an exhaustive search among all exposed atoms or surface water molecules for every buried atom, while our graph-based concept of burial level can be easily calculated by transferring the calculation into a single-source-shortest-path problem. directly broken atomic contact, atomic contact types and features when a residue is mutated into alanine, some interfacial atomic contact are directly broken because of the removal of certain atoms; some other interfacial atomic contacts may also be broken or distorted due to the conformational change in the local region <cit> . given a residue, we consider its directly broken interfacial atomic contacts, namely those contacts formed by an atom other than c, n, o, cα or c and any contact partner from the other chain, even its backbone atoms. for example, for a serine in a complex, the atomic contact between its oγ and a cα of any residue from the interacting partner is a directly broken atomic contact of this serine, while the contact between its cβ and whatever atom from the interacting partner is not. we classify the atomic contacts into three types. if a contact is between a positively charged atom and a negatively charged atom, which usually corresponds to a salt bridge, it is called a type-i contact. if a contact is between a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor, which usually is a hydrogen bond, it is classified as type-ii contact. contacts that are neither type-i nor type-ii are classified as type-iii. here, the definitions for positively charged atoms, negatively charged atoms, hydrogen bond donors and hydrogen bond acceptors are as given in <cit> . we do not further divide the type-iii contacts into subtypes such as other polar contact, hydrophobic contact and so on because they are all not as specific as type-i and -ii contacts. note that the definitions for type-i and type-ii contacts are not exactly the same as salt bridges and hydrogen bonds in terms of geometrical requirements, yet they can be still very important <cit> . in this work, we use deeply buried atomic contacts whose burial level is not less than <dig> we refer to atomic contacts at burial level <dig> as exposed atomic contacts and those at burial level <dig> as slightly buried atomic contacts. let c denote the number of type-i directly-broken interfacial atomic contacts at burial level j of a residue. then our model uses <dig> features to describe a residue: c, c, c, c, c, plus the burial level of the residue. an svm model based on this feature set is named dbac . for comparison, we have also built another model named ac based on another feature set comprising c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, and the burial level of the residue. the maximum value of burial level depends on the size of the protein complexes, the size of the interfaces as well as the shape of the complex and the organization of the atoms. in general, very few contacts have burial level larger than <dig> so we do not distinguish further burial levels larger than <dig> for type-i contact, there are very few cases that have burial level larger than <dig> thus we do not use c as a feature but merge it with c into c. svm training-testing protocol support vector machines are widely used in many classification and regression problems. they have also been adopted in hot spots prediction problems <cit> with various feature sets and training-testing protocols. in this work, we use the libsvm software <cit> , which is a tool for svm model training and testing available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm. we use the radial basis function as the kernel. we do not conduct feature selection because our method is straightforward, and the number of features is not large. however, we evaluate performance on two different feature sets: the deeply buried atomic contacts only and all the atomic contacts . the latter feature set is evaluated just for comparison. the performance is evaluated under leave-one-out cross-validation. to avoid over fitting, we have strictly followed a nested-loop cross-validation procedure. there are <dig> mutations in our data set, each time one mutation is taken as the test data and the remaining <dig> mutations are used to train the model. the two parameters, namely cost and gamma, are optimized on the training data by a grid search. the grid search evaluates the performance, f measure, of svms with different parameter values on the training data using 5-fold cross-validation, and the parameter values with the best performance are chosen to build a training model on the training data. this training model is then applied to the test data, that is, the mutation held out in advance. this procedure is repeated <dig> times until every mutation in the data set is tested. metrics in performance evaluation and statistical analysis performance is measured by sensitivity, precision, specificity, accuracy and f measure . these measures are defined asfollows: , , , , and , where tp, fp, tn and fn are the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives, respectively. a better classifier should predict hot spot residues with less false positives and less false negatives; thus the f measure, which combines sensitivity and specificity, is used to indicate the overall performance. we also test the significance of the difference in ∆∆g values of predicted hot spot and non hot spot residues. a classifier divides the mutations in the data set into two groups: computational hot spot residues and computational non hot spot residues. the significance of the ∆∆g value difference in these two groups are tested by mann-whitney test <cit> . the result of a classifier with higher f <dig> value can be less significant when its false positives have very low ∆∆g values and the false negatives have high ∆∆g values. we also examine the value distribution of individual features in hot spot and non hot spot residues. the significance of the difference in the two classes is also tested by mann-whitney test. RESULTS performance of hot spot residue prediction as introduced, <dig> new features are derived from those deeply buried interfacial atomic contacts which are directly broken by alanine substitution. the feature values of a residue are then fed into svm together with the overall residue burial level to predict whether this residue is a hot spot residue or not. the performance under leave-one-out cross-validation is shown in the second row of table <dig> we achieve an f measure of <dig> , when ∆∆g ≥ <dig> is used as the threshold to define hot spot residues. the precision of our method is higher than the recall, which means that there are fewer false positives than false negatives. a reason for this is that our model emphasizes the contribution of directly broken atomic contacts. the contacts that are broken or newly formed by the conformational change during the mutation are hard to define quantitatively. the ∆∆g of some hot spot residues, whose mutation results in a large conformational change, cannot be fully explained by its directly broken atomic contacts. this is reflected in the lower sensitivity value. the non hot spot residues, whose ∆∆g is low, tend to have fewer deeply buried directly broken atomic contacts, leading to a smaller number of false positives and hence a higher precision. we have also evaluated the performance of using the ac feature set containing <dig> features, which take exposed and slightly buried atomic contacts into consideration as well. as shown in the third row of table <dig> the performance is not improved even though extra exposed and slightly buried atomic contacts are added to the feature set. rather, the f measure is driven down to <dig> and the statistical significance is reduced a lot as well. the reason is presented later. the reason we use leave-one-out cross-validation is that we have a small data set and, moreover, there are only a small number of positive samples . to test the robustness of our method, we evaluate performance using leave-n-out cross-validation under the same training-testing procedure. we find that when n is not large , the performance change is not significant, sometimes better and sometimes worse than that by using leave-one-out. anyway, as shown later, no matter how large n is, our performance is always better than robetta and foldx. for example, the performance of our method by 5-fold cross-validation is <dig> in f measure. this indicates that our method is robust. we compare our method with three energy-based methods, robetta <cit> , foldx <cit> and egad <cit> . robetta is an online service. it can be used to predict the ∆∆g value of interfacial residues by computational alanine scanning based on an energetic function. it can thus be applied to hot spot prediction. actually, it is a widely recognized gold standard for benchmark comparison in the field. its performance on our data set is shown in the forth row of table <dig> our performance is remarkably better than that of robetta in terms of both f <dig> and p-value. foldx is also available online. it is able to predict the change in both protein stability and affinity. its energy function contains different sources of contributions such as van der waals interactions, hydrogen bonds and even water-bridged interactions. we calculated the ∆∆g of mutations in our data set by using foldx version <dig> beta <dig> with default parameters. from the fifth row of table <dig> although foldx shows a better performance than robetta, probably due to the fact that it is being updated, our method still achieves a better performance than that by foldx. edag contains a group of energy functions for protein design and it has a module to predict the change in binding free energy after a mutation. we compare our method with egad based on the data that is common between our data set and those reported in their paper <cit> , namely <dig> mutations . as shown in table <dig> our method’s performance is significantly better than that of egad. in fact, egad tends to underestimate the ∆∆g values—especially for the barnase-barstar complex in which there are many hot spot residues—thus many hot spot residues are misclassified as non hot spot, resulting in poor sensitivity. these energy-based method are complicated and time-consuming. the energy functions usually contain many terms that represent different kinds of energies. both binding and folding of proteins can affect the binding free energy between two proteins. but binding and folding are very complicated processes whose details are difficult to capture. when a residue is mutated into alanine, the new structure of the mutated protein and the mutated protein complex must be predicted to get the values of all energy terms of the mutated structure, which is also very difficult. thus the ∆∆g are hard to be accurately estimated even by these complicated energy functions. from tables <dig> and <dig> the performance of these energy-based methods are not very good yet. we also compare our method with another machine learning method, minerva <cit> , which uses svm as well and is based on a larger feature set containing various aspects of information of target residue such as weighted atomic packing density, relative surface area burial, weighted hydrophobicity and so on. minerva has good performance in terms of f <dig> value in comparison with other previous machine-learning methods. because its source codes and software are not available, we compare the performance on data that are common between the minerva paper and our data set. this common data set contains <dig> mutations with <dig> hot spot residues and <dig> non hot spot residues. it can be seen from table <dig> that minerva does not outperform our method in terms of f measure or p-value. moreover, the reported performance of minerva may be biased upwards by an overfitting effect because minerva uses <dig> features selected from a total of <dig> basing on the whole data set. minerva had also been tested on an independent data set derived from bid <cit> , where the importance of a residue is labeled as “strong”, “intermediate”, “weak” or “insignificant”. in that test, minerva treated a residue as a hot spot residue only when its label is “strong”. we also test our model on a subset of this independent data set containing <dig> mutations whose pdb files have associated solvent information. the performance of our model in terms of f <dig> on this data set is 52%, which is same as that of minerva. note that the label of a residue is not perfectly correlated to its ∆∆g, which is an inconsistency between the training data and the test data; however, it still can indicate the contribution of a residue to binding. feature analysis we test the significance of the difference of the values of a feature in the hot spot and non hot spot residues. the p-values are reported in table <dig> it is clear that the dbac features have very low p-values, indicating that their values are significantly different between the two classes. the p-value of c is not as low as that of other dbac features, because there are fewer residues that have salt bridges. the numbers of slightly buried atomic contacts are not as significant as those of the deeply buried ones. thus our feature set can indeed reflect the contrast between hot spot residues and non hot spot residues, and the idea of excluding slightly buried and exposed atomic contacts and using only deeply buried atomic contacts is statistically reasonable. feature feature feature the features in the feature set dbac are emphasized in italics *:residue burial level we show in table <dig> the performance of our method after one feature is removed under the same training-testing protocol described in methods. it seems that the removal of residue burial level, c, c or c has little impact on performance. a reason is that the features we are using are somehow correlated with each other. in general, when an interfacial residue is deeply buried with high residue burial level, it has several deeply buried atomic contacts with the other side. on the other hand, the removal of c or c reduces performance a lot. the reason is that there are often many type-iii atomic contacts in hot spot residues, as type-iii atomic contacts is not as specific as types i or ii. this suggests that we can further divide type-iii atomic contacts into subtypes. we have actually tried dividing type-iii contacts into other polar-polar contacts and hydrophobic contacts; and it turns out that the performance change is not much and hydrophobic contacts become the new dominant one. however, this does not mean residue burial level, c, c and c do not contribute to the performance because all the six features have significantly different values in hot spot and non hot spot residues. in fact, we can achieve an f measure of <dig> with only the residue burial level. another interesting observation from table <dig> is that the performance after the removal of c ) is better than that after the removal of c ), although the difference between hot spot and non hot spot residues in c or c is more significant and the number of residues that have type-ii or type-iii atomic contacts at burial level ≥ <dig> is lower . as we have already shown that the performance with feature set ac is worse than that with dbac, the observation here further indicates that the atomic contact at deeper burial level is more important in hot spot prediction. this again confirms that burial level plays a very important role. residue burial level residue burial level is a very important feature for predicting hot spot residues. its p-value shows a very significant difference between hot spot residues and non hot spot residues, as can be seen in table <dig> here, we explain that residue burial level is more sufficient than sasa in hot spot prediction. bogan and thorn <cit> found that hot spot residues tend to have low sasa values. based on this observation, they suggested the existence of a ring of energetically less important residues that are responsible of protecting the hot spot. generally, a low sasa value is a necessary condition for a residue to become a hot spot residue. thus, it is usually used someway for hot spot prediction. for example, the hotsprint database <cit> defines computational hot spots as those conserved residues that have large sasa change in complex formation and low sasa in the complex. however, a low sasa value is not a sufficient condition for a hot spot. as observed in figure <dig> in our data set, hot spot residues tend to have low sasa values with more than 80% of hot spot residues having sasa less than <dig> Å <dig> but non hot spot residues also follow such a tendency , albeit in a less remarkable yet observable way. we have tried to incorporate sasa into our model, by adding it to the feature set. the performance drops a lot, only <dig> by f measure. in contrast, as shown in figure <dig> hot spot residues tend to have a high burial level, while non hot spot residues do not. more than 60% of hot spot residues have a burial level no less than <dig> , whereas less than 20% of non hot spot residues have such burial levels. thus, we conjecture that a high burial level is not only necessary but also more sufficient than a low sasa value for a hot spot residue. deeply buried atomic contacts type-i atomic contacts roughly correspond to salt bridges. some researchers believe that buried salt bridges provide neutral or even negative contribution to protein stability <cit> because the desolvation of charged groups requires more energy than the interaction energy of the formation of the salt bridge <cit> . but in protein-protein interaction, it is found that interfacial salt bridges are more buried than intra-chain salt bridges, and the salt bridges are found favorable across the interface <cit> . perhaps the two proteins are folded independently with more charged residues exposed and their conformation change during complex formation is very restricted, thus the two proteins prefer to interact in an electrostatic complementary manner. percentages of hot spot residues and non hot spot residues whose c are larger than <dig> are plotted in figure <dig> generally, hot spot residues tend to have their salt bridges buried while non hot spot residues do not. two adjacent exposed oppositely charged groups may not form stable salt bridges at all <cit> ; thus some exposed type-i contacts, most of which are possessed by non hot spot residues, may not be stable salt bridges. hydrogen bonds play a key role in protein-protein interaction <cit> . most interfacial hydrogen bonds are extremely buried; and the more buried a hydrogen bond donor/acceptor is, the more likely it is to form a hydrogen bond <cit> . thus, being buried is favorable for interfacial hydrogen bonds. figure <dig> shows the percentages of hot spot residues and non hot spot residues whose c are larger than <dig> it can be seen that nearly 30% of non hot spot residues have exposed type-ii atomic contacts, but very few of them have deeply buried hydrogen bonds. the case is totally different in hot spot residues. there are more hot spot residues that have deeply buried type-ii atomic contact while a few of them have exposed ones. the number of residues that have extremely buried atomic contacts is limited by the size of the protein complexes. type-iii contacts contain all other kinds of contacts that are neither salt bridges nor hydrogen bonds, including hydrophobic contacts and other polar contacts. actually hydrophobic contacts are not specific contact between atoms but are the packing of groups of hydrophobic side chains. the contribution of hydrophobic contacts to bonding free energy is correlated with the buried surface area <cit> . thus energetically important hydrophobic contacts are those buried ones. generally, protein-protein interfaces are dominated by salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts; but sometimes other contacts also make contribution to the binding <cit> . a hot spot is usually a densely packed region in the interface, thus the number of buried contacts of a hot spot residue tends to be large, which can be reflected by deeply buried type-iii contacts. as shown in figure <dig> more than 80% of hot spot residues have type-iii contact at burial level <dig> and only about 20% non hot spot residues have type-iii contact at this burial level. case study: three residues that are difficult to classify another example as shown in figure <dig> is tyr- <dig> of barstar. this residue is exposed with an sasa of <dig> Å2; however, it is a hot spot residue with a ∆∆g of <dig> kcal/mol. there are only two hot spot residues that have sasa larger than 60Å <dig> in our data set. we can still successfully identify it as a hot spot residue by using its deeply buried atomic contacts. the side-chain of tyrosine which contains an aromatic ring and a hydroxyl group is capable of forming aromatic π-interactions and hydrogen bonds <cit> . as can be seen from the figure, although tyr- <dig> of barstar is partially exposed, its side-chain stretches into the complex and forms many deeply buried atomic contacts. for the <dig> type-ii interfacial atomic contacts shown in the figure, <dig> are deeply buried and <dig> is slightly buried. there are another <dig> deeply buried type-iii contacts, <dig> of which are made by the aromatic ring and <dig> are atomic contacts with his- <dig> an active site residue of barnase <cit> . in figure <dig> we show another residue—asp- <dig> of ribonuclease inhibitor in ribonuclease inhibitor-angiogenin complex—that is in a “wet” local environment, although it is buried inside the interface and well wrapped. it is a hot spot residue with a ∆∆g of <dig> kcal/mol. as can be seen from the figure, this residue has several nearby water molecules, which may be the reason robetta, foldx, egad and minerva have failed to classify it as a hot spot residue. we consider buried water molecules as part of the protein complex; thus, the buried water molecules shown in the figure not only are buried but also are shelters of the nearby residues. this residue has <dig> type-i, <dig> type-ii and <dig> type-iii deeply buried atomic contacts. if we do not consider buried water molecules as part of the complex, these atomic contacts will no longer be deeply buried. CONCLUSIONS we have proposed a feature-based method to predict protein-binding hot spots by using deeply buried interfacial atomic contacts that are directly broken during alanine substitution. the method is based on a graph theoretical definition of burial level of residues, atoms and atomic contacts. we achieved an f measure of <dig> when ∆∆g ≥ <dig> is used as the threshold to define hot spot residues. the burial level of a residue is more intuitive than the concept of sasa. it is nicely correlated with the ∆∆g of a residue. we have shown that a high residue burial level is in general necessary for a residue to be a hot spot residue. furthermore, it is more sufficient than sasa, a frequently used feature in existing hot spot prediction methods. our results also reveal that hot spot residues tend to have deeply buried atomic contacts while non hot spots tend to have exposed and slightly buried ones. this is consistent with previous studies that emphasize the energetic contribution of buried salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. competing interests the authors declare that there are no competing interests. authors’ contributions zl, jl and lw discussed and designed the experiment; zl conducted the experiment and wrote the paper; jl and lw revised the paper. all authors read and approved the final manuscript.",

genome-wide functional analysis. a budding yeast deletion-mutant library has been available for more than ten years <cit> , and recently a fission yeast collection has also become available <cit> . in particular, strain-specific molecular barcodes allow quantitative functional profiling of pooled deletion strains by using a tag oligonucleotide microarray <cit> . among many types of functional profiles, the chemical-genetic profiles express quantitative values of growth defects of deletion strains in the presence of certain chemicals. the compendium of chemical-genetic profiles of heterozygous and homozygous deletion strains for a large number of chemicals has been successfully used to identify direct target proteins of drugs <cit> as well as exploring their modes-of-action <cit> . such profile data can also be a valuable resource for many other applications in chemical genomics. in s. cerevisiae, thousands of chemical-genetic profiles have been generated so far and are publicly available <cit> . fitness data have been deposited in a recently developed public database called fitdb <cit> ; this database, however, only provides limited tools such as an online-interface for searching with keywords such as yeast orfs or drug names. in a large-scale study using a single measurement platform, researchers can easily compare fitness profiles using several well-known similarity measures. then, by clustering the profiles, they can group bioactive compounds with a similar mode-of-action and make a plausible hypothesis about the unknown mode-of-action of a drug <cit> . however, chemical-genetic profiles can be generated using many different measurement platforms such as dna chip-based parallel measurements <cit> , high-density colony measurement on agar plates <cit> , high-density well plate-based optical density <cit> or fluorescence <cit> measurements in liquid culture. moreover, the fitness scores can be expressed in many different ways . such difficulties complicate the process of relating one profile to another. this problem becomes more severe when only a limited number of yeast fitness profiles for a drug of interest are available, and more so when such profiles have been generated by non-chip-based measurement platforms. in such cases, it is very difficult to perform data-mining against the tens of thousands of public fitness profiles that may contain valuable information on the mode-of-action of the drug of interest. in this study, we developed fitrankdb as a general repository of fitness profiles, and fitsearch as a new fitness similarity search algorithm which compares fitness profiles and calculates their similarity score and the corresponding statistical significance, regardless of the types of experimental setup by which they have been generated . the fitrankdb and fitsearch web service provides an uncomplicated means for searching tens of thousands of public yeast fitness profiles and obtaining insight into unknown modes-of-action of drugs. methods the ultimate objective of fitsearch is to provide a computational tool for interpreting any type of yeast fitness profiles in terms of the mode-of-action of a drug through comparison of various types of yeast fitness profiles and publicly available functional annotations. to do this, we first needed to create a general repository of yeast fitness profiles combined with genetic interaction information. next, and more importantly, we needed a universal similarity measure for comparing profiles in a biologically meaningful way. finally, for efficient and wider use of the resources, it was necessary to develop an easy-to-use public server in which users can choose and run several web applications, depending on their specific needs. fitrankdb, a general repository of yeast fitness profiles genome-wide yeast fitness profiles, using a yeast deletion library, have been used to infer the mode-of-action of a drug, genetic interactions, such as synthetic lethality, and functional annotation of unknown genes. we categorized those fitness profiles according to a yeast deletion library and a treatment, and collected them from public resources . to make our collection a general repository for yeast fitness profiles, we defined a flexible standard file format using yaml to express all relevant information available. this yeast fitness yaml is a very simple format, which consists of three-letter keywords and their corresponding values. currently, <dig> three-letter keywords are defined, but this definition is scalable . our internal curation system automatically extracts ranks of raw fitness scores and experimental information from fityaml, and stores them into fitrankdb. for efficient computation, fitrankdb has two types of databases, berkeley db for rank information, and mysql for experimental information. in addition, we collected various functional module definitions, such as protein complexes, to assist biological interpretation of fitness profiles into fitrankdb. see the details at http://pombe.kaist.ac.kr/fitsearch/statistics/ <dig> for example, drug, bioactive compounds or natural crude extracts <dig> for example, knock-out, over-expression or mutation of a gene <dig> homozygous and heterozygous deletion collections of s. cerevisiae and s. pombe are commercially available at open biosystems and bioneer , respectively. biogrid is a manually curated database, which provides various types of genetic interactions. it also contains information that enables us to distinguish query genes from array genes in a genetic interaction assay. to construct genetic-genetic profiles from the biogrid genetic interaction data, we extracted only the synthetic lethality , synthetic growth defect and phenotypic enhancement datasets in s. cerevisiae, and ranked the array genes corresponding to each query gene according to the degree of growth defect: sl > sd > pe. in this procedure, array genes against the same query gene reported in different papers are merged or are separately deposited in fitrankdb. in addition, array genes against a query gene are assumed to be genes of strains with significant growth defects determined by genome-scale screening, and the query gene considered to be identified from a genetic treatment, such as gene knockout. other large genetic interaction datasets from epistatic mini array profiles , were downloaded at http://interactome-cmp.ucsf.edu and deposited into fitrankdb in a similar way: 'chromosome function e-map' <cit> , 'signaling e-map' <cit> , 'early secretory pathway e-map' <cit> and 'rna processing e-map' <cit> . fitsearch, a rank cutoff optimizer as a search engine suppose that we are investigating whether two chemicals share a similar mode-of-action. one way to do this is to measure the similarity between the two fitness profiles of chemicals that may have been generated from different measurement platforms. then, a requisite property for a new similarity measure is that the more similar the modes-of-action of the two chemicals are, the greater the similarity score should be. realizing that the main difficulty in developing a biologically meaningful similarity measure arises from the fact that the profiles may have been generated from different types of experimental setup and that their fitness values may have been expressed in different ways, we first transformed the fitness values of each strain into their ranks. next, considering that only the highly ranked strains that are significantly affected by a given chemical treatment are informative for inferring its mode-of-action, we chose the rank cutoff values for the two fitness profiles. unlike previous methods where cutoff values were chosen rather arbitrarily, we developed an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to choose the two optimal rank cutoff values. this algorithm named \"rank cutoff optimizer\" finds the optimal rank cutoffs by maximizing the statistical significance for overlap of the same set of strains in the two lists. the probability of overlapping by chance is known to follow the hyper-geometric distribution <cit> . suppose that there are mij strains that co-occur in both the query profile, with the rank cutoff i, having qi strains and the target profile, with the rank cutoff j, having tj strains. then the probability of such co-occurrence happening by random chance, p, is given by p=ccc where n is the total number of strains, and c is the number of ways of choosing m strains out of n strains. of particular interest is the cumulative probability of p, hp= ∑m=mijminp which is simply the p-value. in addition, a p-value considering multiple hypothesis correction is defined using bonferroni correction, which is a stringent correction method, given by p˜=np where n is represents the number of tests. this correction eventually increases the p-value. the rank cutoff optimizer calculates the optimal rank cutoffs, i* and j*, by minimizing the p-value, i.e., =argmini,j= <dig> .khp and reports both the overlapping significance defined as -log <dig> and the overlapping score, which is the tanimoto coefficient given by t=mi*j*qi*+tj*-mi*j* we will explain the rank cutoff optimizer step by step with a toy example. suppose that we have two fitness profiles, one as a query and the other as a target. the first step is to convert the fitness values of each strain into their ranks as shown in figure 2a. after each rank in the query and the target is sorted by their corresponding strain names as shown in figure 2a, the rank matches of each strain can be expressed as a \"match matrix\" as shown in the upper panel of figure 2b. in the m, the rows represent the ranks in the query, and columns represent the ranks in the target, and the value indicates the strain number with the same rank in both the query and the target. step <dig> constructing an accumulated match matrix : efficient calculation of the match number accumulated under all possible rank-cutoffs of the query and the target can be achieved by dynamic programming as follows: aij=mij+aij-1+ai-1j-ai-1j- <dig> in the equation , mij is the match number in the rank i of the query and the rank j of the target, and aij is the match number accumulated under the rank-cutoff i of the query and the rank-cutoff j of the target, which is schematically depicted in figure 2b. this accumulated match matrix provides the objective function, hp, with all possible parameters for optimization. in a, values represent mij as the overlapped strain number in the equation , its row-names qi indicate the query strain number and column-names tj indicate the target strain number in their respective rank-cutoffs i and j, and the column or row length n represents the size of the population. in the toy example of figure <dig> the maximal rank-cutoff k is set to the same as n. step <dig> finding the optimal rank-cutoffs from a cumulative hyper-geometric p-value matrix : the cumulative hyper-geometric p-values are calculated through the equation of the objective function, hp for all possible rank-cutoffs, stored in the p, and then used to find the rank-cutoffs with the minimized p-value as described in the equation . in the toy example of figure <dig> the query rank-cutoff of <dig> and the target rank-cutoff of <dig> show the minimal p-value, <dig> . this means that the best significant relationship between the query and the target in terms of overlap is observed at those rank-cutoffs, which are termed optimal rank-cutoffs in our study. after this optimization, we can define the similarity between the query and the target at their optimal rank-cutoffs. in our study, we use two values: one is the minimized p-value as an overlapping significance, and the other is the tanimoto coefficient as an overlapping score. web application as the user interface to search the similarities with all the profiles deposited in the fitrankdb using the rank-cutoff optimizer against a query profile, we provide users with two web frontends . this web application uses a python-based django framework and the rank-cutoff optimizer as the third party program implemented by c program. significant top search results can be differently interpreted according to the types of query and target. some clear interpretations are shown in table <dig> there are more details in 'help' page in the web site. functional annotation: -gene ontology RESULTS in fitsearch, we consider the following two design principles, universality and simplicity . in brief, we adopt the use of rank statistics to compare two fitness profiles. this implies that any type of fitness scores can be universally converted into their corresponding ranks. the similarity of the two rank-transformed profiles can be easily calculated by rank-based comparison methods if we consider all of the profiles. in most situations, however, except for a relatively small number of top-ranked strains that are severely affected by the given drug, most strains can be considered as producing noise signals. therefore, removal of such non-informative strains is necessary in order to calculate more accurate similarity measures and to make more meaningful comparison between profiles that may have been generated from different experimental treatments. an important question then arises: how should we define informative or non-informative strains? in other words, how should we set the optimal rank cutoffs for the two given profiles? the rank cutoff is an arbitrary value, can vary depending on viewpoint of the researcher, and is difficult to choose in advance for a pair of profiles. we solved this problem using an optimization method. among all possible combinations of rank-cutoff values for a pair of profiles, fitsearch finds the optimal rank cutoffs by minimizing the p-value for the co-occurrence of the same set of strains in the two lists by chance, and finally returns two types of scores at those optimal rank cutoffs, viz., the tanimoto coefficient and the p-value . these two scores based on overlapping strains efficiently display the similarity between profiles . researchers do not need to define the cutoff values, which are automatically calculated by an internal optimizer in fitsearch. to investigate whether fitsearch correctly identified fitness profiles sharing a similar mode-of-action, we performed a series of case studies, and validated the results by using prior knowledge and by performing experiments. case study 1: comparing chemical-genetic profiles from different measurement platforms several high-throughput fitness profile datasets generated by using different platforms were deposited in fitrankdb. for example, the compendium named 'cell, 2004' <cit> contains heterozygous fitness profiles from the merck company and fitdb collection <cit> , and 'cell, 2006' contains homozygous fitness profiles from the boone group <cit> . in addition, the compendium named 'science, 2008' <cit> contains both homozygous and heterozygous fitness profiles from the fitdb collection. in this case study, we tested whether our method successfully identified the correct relationships between the chemical-genetic profiles generated from different measurement platforms. clustering the drugs according to the similarity between their corresponding chemical-genetic profiles provides insights into the unknown modes-of-action of drugs. this has been well demonstrated in 'cell, 2006' where fitness profile data were generated from the platform using genome-wide homozygous deletion strains . to generalize such an approach, we developed a method for measuring the similarity between chemical-genetic profiles generated by various types of measurement platforms . we tested our new method using the chemical-genetic profiles of clotrimazole, latrunculin b, beomyl and cisplatin in 'cell, 2006' as a query, and searched the combined database of 'science, 2008' and 'cell, 2006' which contain roughly <dig> profiles. under appropriate two-way cutoffs of overlapping score and significance, the top-ranked target profiles were either fitness profiles of the query drugs from different platforms or those of chemicals known to have a common mode-of-action in common with the query . for example, the best hits for clotrimazole in 'cell, 2006' are clotrimazole with a different dose in 'science, 2008' and fluconazole in 'cell, 2006' . in addition, most of the target profiles of azoles from different platforms are listed in the top ranks. in the case of genome-wide heterozygous deletion strains , the main application of the chemical-genetic profiles is to find direct drug target protein candidates by screening drug-induced haploinsufficient strains <cit> . grouping of similar chemical-genetic profiles is not a typical approach, but was introduced to discover common targets and associated cellular functions for multiple classes of drugs <cit> . to investigate the potential of fitsearch in a diploid collection, we selected as a query the yeast fitness profile of 5-flourouracil , one of chemical-genetic profiles reported in 'cell, 2004' which was the first compendium of chemical-genetic profiles based on a diploid collection. even though this compendium was generated using roughly half of the genome-wide deletion strains, this study demonstrated that it was possible to identify the direct target protein of the drug and reported a novel target of 5-fu. we searched fitrankdb with 5-fu as a query using the fitsearchd program . as expected, fitness profiles of 5-fu with different doses and generated from different platforms resided in the top ranks . additionally, similar chemicals, such as 5-fluorodeoxyuridine and 5-fluorocytosine showed high similarities. a synergistic effect of methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil was also detected by the similarity search. case study 2: comparing chemical-genetic profiles and genetic-genetic profiles in principle, deletion of a gene that encodes the target of an inhibitory compound should cause cellular effects that are similar to the inhibition of the target by drug treatment. in a proof-of-principle experiment, it was shown that for five different chemicals the chemical-genetic profiles were highly similar to the genetic interaction profiles of the target gene or genes in the target pathway <cit> . to generalize this approach, we created a comprehensive compendium of global genetic interaction profiles by combining the interaction data from biogrid <cit> and e-map. biogrid was deposited into fitrankdb in the forms of 'biogrid individual' and 'biogrid merged' . for testing, we used the four chemical-genetic profiles of clotrimazole, latrunculin b, beomyl and cisplatin in 'cell, 2006' as a query, and searched 'biogrid individual', 'biogrid merged' and 'e-map' to find the target profiles. we found that the top-ranked target profiles were relevant to the known mode-of-action of the query chemicals . in particular, the target profile of erg <dig> was detected at the first rank ; erg <dig> is known to be a direct target protein of clotrimazole. case study 3: experimental validation fitsearch is most beneficial to researchers who have performed a small-scale experiment using a yeast deletion collection. in a small-scale experiment, researchers usually generate one or two chemical-genetic profiles by colony- or od-based platforms. that makes it difficult to perform data mining from public resources that were typically generated by chip-based platforms. to investigate how useful fitsearch is for a small-scale experiment, it was applied to obtain a hypothesis on the toxicity and mechanism of action of <dig> -diacetylphloroglucinol . <dig> -dapg is an antibiotic produced by pseudomonas fluorescens that plays a key role in the ability of the bacterium to suppress phytopathogenic fungi. <dig> -dapg has broad antibiotic activity, affecting organisms ranging from bacteria to higher plants. the biosynthesis and regulation of <dig> -dapg in p. fluorescens has been well described. however, the mode of action of the antibiotic against target fungi has not been described in detail. for testing, we selected common mutants in a haploid collection that showed significant growth defects in colony- and od-based screening when exposed to dapg , and transformed them into binary query profiles. public chemical-genetic profiles from 'cell, 2006' and 'science, 2008' were used as the target sources for a similar mode-of-action drug search and public genetic-interaction datasets of 'biogrid individual', 'biogrid merged', and 'e-map' were used as the target sources to find the direct drug target candidates. under appropriate two-way cutoffs of overlapping score and significance, -2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol , sodium azide, and hydrogen peroxide were found to have similar toxicity and mechanism of action to <dig> -dapg . however, no genetic effect similar to <dig> -dapg chemical effect was detected. predicting gene-gene interactions a genetic interaction can be defined as a synergetic phenotype that cannot be elucidated by simply combining the phenotypes of distinct gene perturbations. a typical way to detect genetic interaction is to make use of synthetic lethal genetic screens and synthetic dosage lethal screens. however, due to the vast number of gene-gene combinations, genome-wide screening had not been possible until the synthetic genetic array method <cit> became available. recently, genome-scale sga analysis was used to chart the genetic interaction map in budding yeast <cit> . the profiles of quantitative scores of genes in sga screen were stored in fitrankdb. in addition, we tested whether our fitsearch algorithm could reveal genetic interactions. we carried out fitsearchd for all genetic fitness profiles in fitrankdb first and predicted genetic interactions if the two genetic profiles had a significant p-value and tanimoto coefficient . about 12% of interactions predicted in this study are real genetic interactions according to the work by costanzo et al. <cit> . all other interactions would be either false positives or novel genetic interactions not previously detected. in table <dig> we compiled the top- <dig> list of these interactions sorted by tanimoto coefficient. although the results we obtained are not included in previous sga screening work, there is clear evidence supporting that these predicted interactions are not false positives. these results indicate that fitsearch can find new genetic interactions, which cannot be identified by sga analysis and that these two techniques can complement each other. the table shows the top <dig> results that are not included in the genetic interaction list by sga analysis <cit> . notes without references are retrieved from the saccharomyces genome database <cit> . p-values, here, are corrected considering multiple tests. discussion yeast deletion collections have been successfully used to infer modes-of-actions of drugs especially by profiling chip-based chemical-genetic and genetic-genetic interactions on a genome-wide scale <cit> . in addition, tens of thousands of those profiles are publicly available. however, if researchers only have a few yeast profiles to their drugs of interest with unknown toxicity mechanisms, it is not easy to compare them with public resources to investigate whether similar profiles exist. one of the main reasons is that, typically, the chemical-genetic profiles have been generated on non-chip based measurement platforms, such as a simple 96-well spotting assay or high-density colony measurement on an agar plate <cit> , high-density well plate-based optical density <cit> , or fluorescence <cit> measurements in a liquid culture. furthermore, different fitness scoring methods are also problematic. therefore, there is an urgent need for developing platform- and scoring method-independent ways to compare fitness profiles for more efficient utilization of the public resources. in previous studies, the conventional similarity measures, such as the pearson correlation coefficient, were typically used for comparing fitness profiles. however, such simple similarity measures can be applied only to the profiles generated by well-controlled experiments using a single measurement platform. the probability of chance overlap by chance between two profiles was also used to measure their similarity, but was only applicable to fitness profiles with pre-defined significant thresholds <cit> . such thresholds are typically arbitrary and vary depending on the experimental setup and the researcher's viewpoint. this requires a more universal and simple way to measure similarities. here, we demonstrated the general usability of fitsearch as a new similarity measure of yeast fitness profiles by literature-based and experimental case studies. in the first literature-based case study, we tested whether our new method was able to find drugs with similar modes-of-action even if their fitness profiles had been generated by different measurement platforms. a previous study showed that similarities of chemical-genetic profiles generated from the same platform tended to imply similar modes-of-action of drugs <cit> . our new similarity measure, fitsearch, can generalize such an approach even with chemical-genetic profiles obtained from different experimental platforms. for example, we showed that drugs very similar or the same as 5-fu and clotrimazole were detected in the top rank after fitsearch . in the second literature-based case study, we tested whether the new method could be applied to measure the similarity between a chemical-genetic profile and a genetic-interaction profile. in principle, deletion of a gene that encodes the target of an inhibitory compound should cause cellular effects that are similar to inhibition of the target by a drug treatment. this proof-of-principle experiment was successfully performed <cit> . our fitsearch is a generalization of this type of approach. we showed that the target protein of clotrimazole, erg <dig> was detected using chemical- and genetic-genetic profiles generated in different platforms . fitsearch benefits researchers performing small-scale experiments using yeast deletion collection because in these studies, only one or two chemical-genetic profiles are generated by colony- or od-based platforms. this makes it difficult to perform data mining from public resources, as these data are typically generated on the chip-based platforms. an example is a recent study that generated yeast fitness profiles to <dig> -dapg, an antibiotic with a poorly understood mode-of-action. through similarity searching of fitrankdb using the web-frontend, fitsearchp , we found three similar compounds; menthol, sodium azide and h2o <dig> in the top rank . menthol is known to cause a perturbation in the lipid fraction of the membrane, altered membrane permeability and consequential leakage of intracellular materials <cit> . sodium azide has been known as a rapid and reversible inhibitor of the cytochrome c oxidase-respiratory chain complex iv, through enhanced cytochrome c holoenzyme dissociation <cit> . membrane associated protein kinase c activity can also be altered by sodium azide <cit> . marino et al. <cit> reported that sodium azide increases intracellular calcium in mammalian systems, causing azide neurotoxicity. hydrogen peroxide can damage proteins, lipids, and dna. the primary source of reactive oxygen species such as h2o <dig> is free-leakage of electrons, which is generated by the mitochondrial respiratory system. based on the modes-of-action of these three similar drugs, it was suggested that mechanism of action of <dig> -dapg may involve disturbing cell membrane permeability, triggering of a reactive oxygen burst, and interruption of cell homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS yeast deletion collections have been successfully used to infer mode-of-actions of drugs, in particular by profiling chip-based chemical-genetic and genetic-genetic interactions on a genome-wide scale. for optimal use of public resources, we designed fitrankdb as a general repository of fitness profiles, and developed fitsearch as a new similarity measure between such profiles. we showed that our new repository and algorithm are beneficial to researchers who are attempting to obtain hypothesis regarding the unknown modes-of-action of a bioactive compound through a small-scale experiment with yeast deletion collections from different platforms, specifically non-chip based platforms. competing interests the authors declare that there are no competing interests. authors' contributions ml, sh and dk conceived of the study. sh and hc designed an algorithm and implemented it. ml maintains the web service. yk and dw performed an experimental case study. ml, sh, yk and hc analyzed data. all authors wrote, read and approved the final manuscript. declarations the publication costs for this article were funded by the korean government, the ministry of education, science & technology <cit> . this article has been published as part of bmc genomics volume <dig> supplement <dig> 2013: selected articles from the eleventh asia pacific bioinformatics conference : genomics. the full contents of the supplement are available online at http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcgenomics/supplements/14/s <dig> supplementary material additional file 1 summary of fitseach results of clotrimazole, latrunculin b, benomyl, cisplatin, and <dig> -dapg. click here for file acknowledgements we thank all members of the bioinformatics and computational biology laboratory at kaist for helpful discussions. this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea grant funded by the korean government, the ministry of education, science & technology <cit> .",

    "prompt": "Provide a brief summary emphasizing patient outcomes. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND protein palmitoylation is the addition of a 16-carbon fatty acid primarily to cysteines via a thioester linkage <cit> . this form of fatty acylation targets cytoplasmic proteins to membranes, but can also occur on transmembrane proteins where it often affects protein localization or stability <cit> . identification and characterization of palmitoylated proteins has traditionally been encumbered because of insensitive detection methods, the lack of a consensus amino acid motif for bioinformatics prediction of palmitoylation sites, a lack of antibodies for detecting palmitoylation and challenges in detecting palmitoylated peptides with standard mass spectrometry techniques <cit> . to overcome these difficulties, non-radioactive chemical tools and methodologies have been recently developed that are advancing the study of protein palmitoylation <cit> . an analogue of palmitic acid possessing a terminal alkyne group is incorporated by cells onto proteins at sites of palmitoylation <cit> . the alkynyl group allows a targeted reaction with azide-functionalized detection tags via the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction commonly termed click chemistry . azido-rhodamine is a detection tag that can be used for visualization, while azido-azo-biotin allows selective retrieval of alk-16-labeled proteins using streptavidin-coated agarose <cit> . we, and others, have previously used, and continue to apply these tools for enhancing our understanding of regulation of immune responses by lipid post-translational modifications <cit> .figure <dig> identification of palmitoylated proteins in dc <dig> cells and mefs. a) schematic depicting alk- <dig> chemical reporter metabolic labeling of live cells and subsequent reaction of cell lysates with detection tags for fluorescence visualization of palmitoylated proteins or affinity purification and proteomic identification of palmitoylated proteins. b, c) mock treated or ifnα treated dc <dig> cells and mefs were labeled with alk- <dig> or dmso as a control. lysates were subjected to click chemistry with azido-rhodamine or azido-biotin . b) proteins were separated by sds-page for fluorescence gel scanning to visualize palmitoylome profiles. anti-ifitm <dig> western blotting served as a control for the activity of ifnα and anti-gapdh blotting served as a loading control. the red arrow points to the most prominent change in the banding pattern when comparing mock and ifnα treated samples. c) alk-16/azido-biotin labeled proteins enriched using streptavidin agarose were separated by sds-page, and were stained with coomassie blue for visualization. each lane was cut into slices for trypsin digestion and extraction of peptides for ms/ms identification. d) venn diagram representing proteins identified in c. after subtracting proteins identified in control lanes, 237 dc <dig> proteins and <dig> mef proteins were considered putative palmitoylated proteins. the majority of identified proteins were known to be palmitoylated, including most proteins identified in both cell types and also many of those specifically identified in either dc <dig> cells or mefs . the known ifn-induced and palmitoylated proteins ifitm <dig> and irgm <dig> were identified as upregulated in both ifnα-treated dc <dig> cells and mefs. cd <dig> and tlr <dig> are example immunomodulatory proteins specifically identified in dc <dig> cells, while nedd <dig> is an example protein specifically identified in mefs . dmso, dimethyl sulfoxide; ifitm <dig> interferon -induced transmembrane protein 3; irfm <dig> immunity related gtpase m1; mefs, murine embryonic fibroblasts; ms/ms, tandem mass spectrometry; tlr <dig> toll-like receptor <dig> of particular importance, the aforementioned chemical tools allowed the identification of palmitoylation-dependent antiviral activity of the interferon -induced transmembrane protein <dig> <cit> . in the present study, we performed an analysis of palmitoylated proteins in a murine antigen presenting dendritic cell line in comparison with murine embryonic fibroblasts , both at steady state and after ifnα treatment. known lipidated and ifn-induced proteins, ifitm <dig> bone marrow stromal antigen <dig> and immunity related gtpase m <dig> , were detected in both cell types after ifnα treatment. we also detected novel palmitoylated proteins expressed at steady state, and validated several of these proteins, including t-lymphocyte activation antigen cd <dig> and toll-like receptor <dig> in dendritic cells , and e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase nedd <dig> in mefs. given the complete novelty of the discovery of a lipid modification occurring on a member of the extensively studied tlr family, we chose to focus further on determining the effects of palmitoylation on tlr <dig> tlrs are critical for the cellular recognition of most pathogens <cit> . their detection of microbial products results in activation of the transcription factor nf-κb and production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators of the immune response <cit> . at least <dig> human and <dig> mouse tlrs have now been identified, which recognize distinct sets of pathogen-associated molecules <cit> . tlr <dig> is expressed primarily on myelomonocytic cells including antigen presenting cells, such as dcs and macrophages <cit> . tlr <dig> detects the widest range of microbial products among the tlrs, including lipomannan from mycobacteria, zymosan from yeast and bacterial lipopeptides typified by the pamcsk synthetic lipopeptides <cit> . as such, tlr <dig> knockout mice and humans with deleterious tlr <dig> polymorphisms are more susceptible to multiple pathogens <cit> . thus, tlr <dig> is a critical component of the innate immune system, and a better understanding of its post-translational regulation may prove useful in our defense against pathogenic organisms. RESULTS visualization of palmitoylated proteins in mefs and dc <dig> cells having made the previous discovery of the critical role of palmitoylation of ifitms in the innate antiviral immune response <cit> , we sought to determine whether any additional ifn-induced proteins are regulated by palmitoylation. for our experiments, we chose to use murine antigen presenting cells and mefs because these cell lines are responsive to type i ifns <cit> , are amenable to labeling with the alk- <dig> reporter of protein palmitoylation <cit> and serve as a control for one another in that type i ifn should induce a similar set of proteins in both cell types. additionally, this analysis would provide a valuable comparison of the general palmitoylomes of two cell types with unique functions. dc <dig> cells and mefs were either left untreated or were treated with ifnα for four hours prior to metabolic labeling with alk- <dig> in the presence or absence of ifnα for an additional two hours. cell lysates were reacted with az-rho or az-biotin via click chemistry . az-rho-labeled proteins were separated by sds-page and visualized by fluorescence gel scanning . anti-ifitm <dig> and anti-gapdh blotting were used as controls for the activity of ifnα on these cells and for loading, respectively. the fluorescent profiles of the two cell types did not indicate that drastic changes to palmitoylation occur upon ifnα treatment. however, one specific band could be seen uniquely in the ifnα-treated samples, appearing at approximately 15 kda, potentially corresponding to the molecular weight of the ifitms . mass spectrometric identification of palmitoylated proteins in mefs and dc <dig> cells given that differences induced by ifnα could possibly be masked by highly abundant proteins within the fluorescent palmitoylome profiles observed in figure 1b, we next utilized the fraction of our samples that had been reacted with az-biotin in order to affinity purify alk-16-labeled palmitoylated proteins using streptavidin-coated agarose. these purified proteins were separated by sds-page and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. extracted peptides were then identified by tandem mass spectrometry analysis and assigned to proteins using mascot software. after subtraction of proteins identified in the control lanes as described in the methods section and eliminating proteins with fewer than three spectral counts, a total of <dig> proteins were identified from the dc <dig> samples and <dig> proteins were identified from the mef samples, indicating that there is a large difference in the repertoire of palmitoylated proteins expressed by these different cell types . of the proteins identified in dc <dig> cells, 76% had been previously identified as palmitoylated proteins in our past analysis of this cell line, and by others in proteomic studies of other cell types <cit> . of the proteins identified in mefs, which had not been palmitoylome profiled before, 64% were previously reported to be palmitoylated, providing strong validation of our methodology . analysis of several known palmitoylated proteins that were identified uniquely in only one of the two cell types would suggest that their differential detection is due to cell type-specific expression differences. for example, sortilin- <dig> , inducible nitric oxide synthase and hla class ii histocompatibility antigen gamma chain were uniquely detected in dc <dig> cells, consistent with published data curated by biogps showing that murine dcs express these genes while mefs do not <cit> . conversely, catenin delta , flotillin- <dig> , gtpase hras and tyrosine-protein kinase yes were detected in mefs, but not in dcs , again corresponding to cell type-specific expression patterns <cit> . further supporting the assertion that the observed differences in the proteins detected are not due to differences in the ability of the two cell types to palmitoylate different subsets of proteins, biogps was also utilized to examine the mef and dc expression patterns for the dhhc palmitoyltransferases , the enzyme family responsible for the majority of s-palmitoylation in cells <cit> . indeed, murine mefs and dcs each express nearly all of the dhhcs, with the exception of dhhcs <dig> and <dig> which are testis-specific and dhhc <dig> which is brain-specific <cit> . bioinformatic classification of alk-16-labeled proteins commonly identified in both mefs and dc <dig> cells we identified <dig> alk-16-labeled proteins that were common to both dc <dig> cells and mefs , suggesting that these proteins may perform fundamental cellular functions. these included critical cellular proteins such as calnexin , gtpase nras and the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor . indeed, exploring the classification of these <dig> proteins shows that proteins with enzymatic activity constituted 40% of the <dig> transporters and ion channels formed another 20%. an additional 37% constituted structural proteins and those in ubiquination and glycosolation processes, with the remaining 3% being cellular receptors and transcription regulators . enrichment analysis using ingenuity defined pathways recapitulated that palmitoylation is critical for a multitude of signaling pathways, including those downstream of ephrin receptors and integrins, as well as axonal guidance signaling . similarly, pathways centering on the cellular morphology-controlling small gtpases, rac <dig> and/or rhoa, involving multiple palmitoylated proteins were identified . on a more global level, network analysis of the <dig> shared palmitoylated proteins demonstrated that the myc proto-oncogene protein and the cellular tumor antigen p <dig> are upstream of <dig> of these proteins, which is more than would be expected by chance . several dhhcs have been discovered to be misregulated in various tumors, but their contribution to tumorigenesis is currently unclear <cit> . palmitoylated myc and p <dig> effector proteins may offer candidates for future experiments determining the role of specific dhhcs and palmitoylated proteins in cancer progression. taken together, a multitude of coherent pathways are regulated by palmitoylation in both dcs and mefs, and these data add to our growing appreciation of the roles palmitoylation plays in regulating a myriad of basic cellular processes. ifn-induced fatty acylated proteins we also identified proteins present only in the ifnα-treated samples or that had peptide peak area measurements that were increased in the ifnα-treated samples by at least <dig> fold. since type i ifns generally induce a common set of antiviral proteins even in distinct cell types, we reasoned that true ifn-induced palmitoylated proteins should be present in the ms/ms results of both dc <dig> cells and mefs. with this additional criterion, we were left with only three proteins enriched in the ifnα-treated samples in both cell types: ifitm <dig> irgm <dig> and bst <dig> also known as tetherin. indeed, each of these proteins is known to be ifn-inducible, and ifitm <dig> serves as a control since we expected to identify this protein based on our past work <cit> . palmitoylation of irgm <dig> was verified in our laboratory , and was also recently reported to be important for its membrane localization and ability to affect mitochondria membrane dynamics <cit> . interestingly, past palmitoylome profiling studies of murine t cells <cit> and human b cells <cit> also identified bst <dig> as a putative palmitoylated protein. although bst <dig> palmitoylation has not yet been validated by visualization methods, the study performed in murine t cells found that mass spectrometric detection of alk-16-labeled bst <dig> was diminished upon sample treatment with hydroxylamine, which cleaves thioester bonds characteristic of palmitoylation <cit> . likewise, the work identifying bst <dig> in b cells utilized acyl-biotin exchange chemistry, which allows specific enrichment of s-acylated proteins <cit> . bst <dig> is also well characterized to be lipidated with a gpi anchor <cit> , which could incorporate long chain fatty acids such as alk- <dig> although previous alk- <dig> proteomic profiling studies have not been significantly contaminated with gpi anchored proteins, arguing against this possibility <cit> . mutation of individual residues within bst <dig> will be necessary to determine the precise location and type of lipidation reported by alk- <dig> labeling. nonetheless, our data confirm that the ifn-induced effector proteins, ifitm <dig> irgm <dig> and bst <dig> are each lipid-modified. novel palmitoylated proteins identified in mefs and dc <dig> cells our work identified <dig> proteins in mefs and <dig> proteins in dc <dig> cells that had not been previously reported to be palmitoylated in past proteomic studies . many of these proteins were found in only one of the two cell types. for example, we observed the e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase nedd <dig> specifically in mefs , and confirmed its palmitoylation, thereby identifying an entirely new modification with potential regulatory activity on this extensively studied and critically important protein <cit> . of particular interest to our laboratory were two proteins uniquely identified in dc <dig> cells that are essential to immune responses, cd <dig> and tlr <dig> cd <dig> is expressed on the surface of mature dcs and provides a costimulatory signal to t cells that is necessary for their proper activation <cit> . we thus sought to confirm cd <dig> palmitoylation and map its site of modification. utilizing a c-terminally ha-tagged construct of murine cd <dig> , we were able to validate our ms/ms results by demonstrating robust labeling of cd86-ha with alk- <dig> . interestingly, palmitoylated cd86-ha was observed as multiple high mw bands indicating that its glycosylated forms are palmitoylated <cit> , while its non-glycosylated form at the expected molecular weight of 35 kda was not modified, potentially suggesting sequential modification . mutation of cys- <dig> to ala at the cytoplasmic edge of the cd <dig> transmembrane domain resulted in a complete loss of alk- <dig> labeling, implicating cys- <dig> as the primary site of cd <dig> palmitoylation . cd <dig> has homology to, and a partially redundant function with, t-lymphocyte activation antigen cd <dig> <cit> . we thus generated a cd80-ha construct and also confirmed its palmitoylation , thereby demonstrating a conservation of this ptm on the cd <dig> and cd <dig> costimulatory molecules.figure <dig> confirmation of the s-palmitoylation of immunomodulatory proteins, cd <dig> and tlr <dig> a-c) validation and mapping of cd <dig> and tlr <dig> palmitoylation. hek293t cells were transfected with the indicated cd86-ha , flag-tlr <dig> , or tlr2-yfp constructs. transfected cells were labeled with <dig> um alk- <dig> or dmso as a control for one hour. cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for the respective epitope tag or fluorescent protein. immunoprecipitates were reacted with azido-rhodamine for visualization of palmitoylation by fluorescent gel scanning. western blotting was performed to confirm comparable protein loading. d,e) overexpression screens to identifiy dhhcs capable of modifying cd86-ha and flag-tlr <dig> hek293t cells were co-transfected with ha-tagged dhhcs <dig> to <dig> or gst as a control and either cd86-ha or flag-tlr <dig> . immunoprecipitated proteins were treated and visualized as in a-c. western blotting was performed to confirm comparable protein loading. bar graphs represent average quantified fluorescence intensities from at least three identical experiments normalized to their respective western blots. values for cd <dig> or tlr <dig> co-transfected with gst control were set to <dig> dhhc constructs are labeled according to previously used dhhc nomenclature in order to be consistent with past studies using these constructs. importantly, dhhcs <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> are the same in both the previous and modern nomenclature. note that in d, dhhc <dig> itself is visible in the fluorescent gel scan of this region. the expression levels of the individual dhhcs obtained in a representative experiment are shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig> dmso, dimethyl sulfoxide; tlr <dig> toll-like receptor <dig> we similarly confirmed tlr <dig> palmitoylation utilizing a previously generated construct in which the human tlr <dig> er signal sequence was replaced by an artificial signal sequence followed by a flag epitope tag <cit> . indeed, flag-tlr <dig> was readily labeled by alk- <dig> . two cytoplasmic-facing cysteines within tlr <dig> cys- <dig> and cys- <dig> were predicted by the css-palm version <dig> palmitoylation site prediction program <cit> to be highly probable sites of palmitoylation. generating cys to ala mutations at these positions and at the nearby cys- <dig> allowed for the demonstration that palmitoylation is lost only when cys- <dig> is mutated . thus, while bioinformatic methods may provide candidate sites of modification, the study of protein palmitoylation requires empirical validation. we further confirmed that cys- <dig> is the primary site of human tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation using a tlr <dig> construct with its natural er signal sequence and a c-terminal yfp tag <cit> , and also verified that murine tlr <dig> is s-palmitoylated on the same residue . to determine the extent to which palmitoylation is conserved on tlrs other than tlr <dig> we tested a panel of human tlrs <dig> to <dig> for alk- <dig> labeling in hek293t cells. while the expression levels of the different tlrs varied, tlr <dig> tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> clearly showed palmitoylation signals above background bands . interestingly, tlr <dig> which physically interacts with tlr <dig> and has been associated with regulating tlr <dig> responses , had the strongest palmitoylation signal relative to its total protein level . these findings reveal that palmitoylation is at least partially conserved on a subset of the human tlrs. these data also confirm that palmitoylation of transmembrane proteins occurs with specificity that is not currently predictable by sequence analysis or by homology with known palmitoylated proteins. palmitoylation of cd <dig> and tlr <dig> can be increased by specific dhhcs in order to examine whether or not s-palmitoylation of cd <dig> and tlr <dig> could be installed by specific dhhcs, we performed overexpression screens of each of the dhhcs with cd <dig> and tlr <dig> this method is commonly used to identify dhhcs capable of modifying individual protein substrates <cit> . cd86-ha s-palmitoylation was increased by dhhcs <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> . flag-tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation was similarly enhanced by the dhhcs <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> . since the palmitoylation sites of cd <dig> and tlr <dig> are both at the cytoplasmic edge of their respective transmembrane domains, this may suggest that this subset of dhhcs is particularly adept at modifying cysteines adjacent to membranes. however, unlike cd <dig> palmitoylation of tlr <dig> was also increased by dhhc <dig> demonstrating substrate specificity for individual dhhcs . overall, these experiments further validate that cd <dig> and tlr <dig> are s-palmitoylated proteins whose modification can be mediated enzymatically by specific dhhcs. palmitoylation is required for complete activation of nf-κb by tlr2 given our laboratory’s focus on innate immunity, we chose to further investigate the effects of s-palmitoylation on the activity of tlr <dig> in primary cultured dcs. for these experiments, we utilized a commonly used covalent inhibitor of dhhcs, 2-bromopalmitate <cit> . we found that 2-bp treatment of murine bone marrow-derived dcs resulted in a loss of the endogenous tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation signal . concomitantly, 2-bp-treated bmdcs lost the ability to produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and tnfα in response to pam3csk <dig> and lipomannan, which are microbe-based ligands specifically detected by tlr <dig> . since prolonged exposure to 2-bp can result in off-target effects and cellular toxicity <cit> , we also employed sendai virus, a tlr-independent activator of cytoplasmic rig-i-like receptors, as a control <cit> . sendai virus induced high levels of il- <dig> and tnfα secretion even in the presence of 2-bp , indicating that the effects of 2-bp were largely specific to the tlr <dig> pathway . additionally, we did not observe overt cellular toxicity upon 2-bp treatment in the time period examined, as judged by trypan blue exclusion. treatment with 2-bp also inhibited lipomannan-induced il- <dig> and tnfα secretion from primary human monocyte-derived dcs . thus, the inhibition of cellular palmitoylation by 2-bp leads to an impaired tlr2-dependent proinflammatory cytokine response by dcs.figure <dig> tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation is necessary for nf-kb-dependent gene induction and cytokine production in response to tlr <dig> microbial ligands. a) tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation is inhibited by 2-bp in bmdcs. cells were treated with <dig> um 2-bp or an equivalent volume of dmso for eight hours prior to labeling for one hour with <dig> um alk- <dig> tlr <dig> was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and reacted with az-rho for fluorescence visualization of palmitoylation. western blotting with anti-tlr <dig> antibodies was performed to confirm comparable protein loading. b) cytokine secretion in reponse to tlr <dig> ligands is inhibited by 2-bp in bmdcs. cells were treated with <dig> um 2-bp or an equivalent volume of dmso for eight hours. tlr <dig> ligands, pam3csk <dig> or lipomannan , or sendai virus , were added to the cellular media for an additional six hours. il- <dig> and tnfα levels in cellular supernatants were measured by elisa. results in a,b are representative of three experiments. error bars in b are the standard deviation of triplicate samples. c) palmitoylation-deficient tlr <dig> is less able than wt to induce nf-κb-dependent gene expression in response to microbial ligands. hek293t cells were co-transfected with the indicated plasmids along with a reporter construct expressing nf-κb-driven firefly luciferase and a plasmid constitutively expressing renilla luciferase for normalization. cells were mock treated or treated for eight hours with pam3csk <dig> , lipomannan or zymosan , and luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates. results are presented as fold induction over mock treated samples. d) western blots confirming similar expression of tlr2-yfp and tlr2-c609a-yfp in experiments performed in c. results in c, d are representative of at least five experiments. error bars in c represent standard deviation of triplicate samples. *p < <dig> by student’s t-test. az-rho, azido-rhodamne; bmdcs, bone marrow dendritic cells; dmso dimethyl sulfoxide; tlr, toll-like receptor; 2-bp, 2-bromopalmitate. we next measured the ability of tlr2-yfp and tlr2-c609a-yfp to stimulate nf-κb-dependent gene expression in response to microbial ligands. tlr2-c609a-yfp was significantly less able than tlr2-yfp to induce nf-κb-dependent luciferase production in response to pam3csk <dig> lipomannan and zymosan . levels of wt and mutant tlr <dig> were comparable in these experiments as measured by western blotting . similar results demonstrating a defect in the induction of nf-κb-dependent luciferase activity by the palmitoylation-deficient tlr2-c609a mutant were also obtained when utilizing flag-tagged constructs, and further demonstrated that this decrease in activity is specific for mutation of the cys- <dig> palmitoylation site since a cys- <dig> to ala mutant possessed activity similar to wt flag-tlr <dig> . in sum, our data demonstrate that the tlr <dig> cys-609 s-palmitoylation site is required for proper activation of nf-κb in response to microbial ligands. s-pamitoylation of tlr <dig> promotes its cell surface localization we next examined the effect of endogenous tlr <dig> ligation on its s-palmitoylation status. we observed that tlr <dig> palmitoylation is decreased upon stimulation of murine bmdcs with lipomannan . this palmitoylation decrease correlates with a decrease in tlr <dig> surface staining, while surface staining of costimulatory molecules and mhc ii increased as expected for activated dcs . this finding is also consistent with past observations of tlr <dig> downregulation at the cell surface upon binding of its ligands <cit> . the correlation between decreased tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation and decreased cell surface levels suggested that, perhaps, s-palmitoylation affects tlr <dig> localization. indeed, inhibition of palmitoylation with 2-bp decreased endogenous tlr <dig> surface staining of bmdcs, while overall cellular levels of tlr <dig> remained similar . in accord with these results, overexpressed murine flag-tlr2-c609a showed a subtle, but reproducible, decrease in cell surface staining when compared to wt flag-tlr <dig> , with their mean fluorescence intensities differing by approximately 25% on average . importantly, achieving robust cell surface staining of flag-tlr <dig> constructs required transfection of five to ten times more dna than was required for activity assays, perhaps suggesting that the forced overexpression of the wt and c609a tlr <dig> constructs results in underestimation of their cell surface differences. we further confirmed that overall protein levels and the stability of tlr <dig> are not affected by palmitoylation by performing pulse-chase analysis of flag-tlr <dig> and flag-tlr2-c609a, which demonstrated that the decay of the wt and mutant proteins was similar . overall, we conclude that s-palmitoylation positively regulates tlr <dig> activity, at least in part, by promoting its trafficking to the cell surface.figure <dig> s-palmitoylation promotes tlr <dig> cell surface expression. a-c) bmdcs were mock treated or treated with <dig> ug/ml lipomannan for 24 hours. a) cells were labeled with <dig> um alk- <dig> for one hour. immunoprecipitated tlr <dig> was reacted with az-rho for visualization of

CONCLUSIONS the development of chemical proteomic methods to identify palmitoylated proteins has led to a tremendous increase in our appreciation of the numerous ways in which palmitoylation regulates key cellular processes and can control cell type-specific pathways <cit> . we previously reported the identification of <dig> palmitoylated proteins in dc <dig> cells that included proteins critical to antiviral immune responses <cit> . however, the absence of several expected palmitoylated proteins from our ms/ms identification led us to hypothesize that additional unknown palmitoylated proteins also remained to be identified in this cell type <cit> . indeed, refinements to our palmitoylated protein enrichment protocol that included increased incubation time with streptavidin agarose and repeated washing steps, along with updates to our mass spectrometry capabilities, have led to a deeper coverage of the dc <dig> palmitoylome . in comparison to the palmitoylome of mefs, we identified novel putative palmitoylated proteins that play a role in the immune functions of dcs. following up on several of these proteins, we were able to validate palmitoylation of the cd <dig> and cd <dig> costimulatory molecules as well as tlr <dig> . interestingly, our proteomic results indicated that mefs express a wider diversity of palmitoylated proteins than dcs , and include many proteins, such as nedd <dig> that should lead to exciting follow up studies. our discovery of cd <dig> cd <dig> and tlr <dig> palmitoylation in dcs reveals novel mechanisms of immune regulation, and underscores the value of examining palmitoylation in diverse cells types. cd <dig> and cd <dig> are essential for immune responses to most pathogens as well as for elimination of tumor cells by the immune system <cit> . these costimulatory molecules provide a second signal for t-cell activation in addition to mhc/peptide complexes presented on the surface of mature dcs <cit> . future studies will aim to determine whether palmitoylation is involved in the trafficking of these molecules to the dc surface, their subsequent clustering at the immunological synapse and their impact on immune function. here, we specifically followed up on the role of s-palmitoylation in regulating tlr <dig> activity. indeed, the response to all microbial ligands of tlr <dig> that were tested was decreased in the absence of tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation, indicating that this lipid modification is a positive regulator of tlr <dig> activity . s-palmitoylation is necessary for complete localization of tlr <dig> at the cell surface, and thus likely affects its interactions with its ligands . while an effect of palmitoylation on the cell surface expression of multiple other proteins has been previously reported <cit> , it is interesting to note that although cd <dig> and tlr <dig> are both s-palmitoylated at membrane-proximal cysteines by a similar subset of dhhcs , their cell surface localization is inversely regulated during dc activation . this reinforces the commonly observed theme that palmitoylation can have unpredictable effects depending on the protein context in which it occurs <cit> . future analyses of how s-palmitoylation of additional immune receptors controls their localization, interactions and signaling will be an exciting area of future study, as will the examination of potential subversion of tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation by pathogens. importantly, the identification of s-palmitoylation of tlrs suggests that this reversible form of protein lipidation <cit> may be targeted in the future to manipulate beneficial and non-beneficial tlr2-mediated immune responses.",

    "prompt": "Generate a short summary focusing on diagnostic criteria. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND understanding the phyletic relationship among living organisms has long been a fundamental challenge since the concept of evolution had emerged. traditionally, molecular biologists constructed phylogenetic trees based on the sequence similarity of small subunit ribosomal rna <cit> or other single genes. as whole-genome sequencing technologies advance, vast amount of sequence data become available for download and analysis. without question, the comparative analysis of whole genomes can provide more information to reconstruct the phylogeny than individual genes do. consequently, numerous methods have been proposed to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees from whole genome features such as oligonucleotide compositions <cit> , genome fragment occurrence <cit> , and absence/presence of metabolic features <cit> . in parallel with genomic comparisons, many studies focused on the similarity of metabolic processes. metabolic profiles of a living organism are strongly related to its environment, and metabolism is adapted to balance compounds taken up from its surroundings <cit> . thus, metabolic consideration can add insights into species-environment interaction such as symbiosis or convergent adaptation to extreme environments. to analyze the phyletic relationship in metabolic capability, there are at least <dig> approaches. the first is machine learning. oh et al. used a distance computed by the exponential graph kernel, i.e., the weighted sum of similarities between adjacency matrices of 1-step neighbors, 2-step neighbors, and so on for <dig> organisms <cit> . the second is network comparison. zhang et al. defined existence/absence of metabolic pathways and computed the network similarity measure for <dig> organisms <cit> . the last is ec-based classification. clemente et al. used sets of ec numbers to define pathway similarity and compared metabolism of <dig> bacteria <cit> . metabolic data are well standardized in previous approaches because all works depended on the bulk-downloadable kegg database <cit> . less concerned, however, was the strategy for transforming enzymatic reactions into graphs . depending on the strategy, resulting networks are drastically different enough to change fundamental network centralities <cit> . for example, borenstein et al. converted each enzymatic reaction to a fully connected bipartite graph between substrates and products to enhance connectivity and defined ‘seed’ compounds for each organism as the union of essential metabolites in all environments <cit> . this transformation is known to overestimate the ability to synthesize/degrade metabolites. on the other hand, using the ec numbers for pathway analysis tend to underestimate the metabolic network because the numbers are assigned to biochemical transformation, and not to enzyme themselves. we here propose a more suitable data representation, and elucidate the phylogenies across three domains of life. its effectiveness is shown in comparison with previous approaches. methods enzyme annotation for organisms enzyme annotations and corresponding ec reactions for <dig> organisms were obtained from the kegg database through its application program interface. the number of ec reactions was <dig> covering as many as <dig> pathway maps. metabolic annotations in each species were represented as a set of substrate-product relationships by transforming all assigned ec reactions into a set of metabolite pairs . most ec-numbered entries correspond to multiple enzymatic reactions. for example, alcohol dehydrogenase can catalyze a multitude of compounds with a hydroxyl group. for such generic ec-numbered functions we manually integrated possible reactions to ensure the coverage of biochemical transformation shown in the metabolic maps. strategy for graph transformation an enzymatic reaction usually has multiple inputs and outputs . although standard metabolic pathway charts are depicted as hypergraphs, substrate-product relationships must be specified for each reaction to transform it into a graph. a standard way is to use a fully connected bipartite graph <cit> . the network connectivity then portrays the ‘reaction membership’; frequently occurring metabolites become hub nodes in the resulting graph. the representation, however, does not capture biochemical transformation between compounds because any two metabolites can be falsely linked through metabolic hubs regardless of their structures <cit> . to avoid this bypassing effect, we employ the substrate-product decomposition of reactions <cit> . in this scheme, each reaction is decomposed into a set of structurally related substrate-product pairs at the atomic scale. the data are also available from the rpair database <cit> , and the same method has been used in several recent works <cit> . this representation avoids bias originating from currency metabolites. in other words, the method focuses on the variation of structural transformations, not the occurrence of each metabolite. the decomposition results of ec-numbered reactions are accessible at our wiki-based site: http://metabolomics.jp/wiki/enzyme:. for example, the details of hexokinase can be accessed at http://metabolomics.jp/wiki/enzyme: <dig> . <dig> in the transformation, we replaced generic names such as alcohol or amino acids with concrete compound names. for hexokinase, as many as <dig> reactions are included depending on hexose types. through this decomposition, a set of enzymatic reactions becomes a set of substrate-product pairs. we did not consider the multiplicity of each pair in our analysis. phyletic reconstruction phyletic trees were created by a hierarchical clustering method using the cluster <dig> software program <cit> . each organism was represented as a vector of substrate-product pairs, where the absence/presence of each relationship was denoted as <dig> or <dig> for visualization, dendroscope software program <cit> was used to analyze and compare phyletic trees. the employed simple algorithm may be controversial for phyletic reconstruction, and will be discussed later. RESULTS we compared results of our data representation with several recent, well known studies. phyletic trees for multi-domains of life based on substrate-product relationships to compare with the phylogeny reconstruction based on the ‘seed’ metabolites <cit> , we reconstructed a phyletic tree for <dig> species using our substrate-product pairs. figure <dig> shows the summarized view of both trees of life. both approaches clustered <dig> main domains successfully, but the seed approach placed plants and fungi among bacteria. this is a serious artifact; since the seed approach focuses on essential metabolites, classification based on secondary metabolites becomes unstable. in both trees, a few seemingly dispersed clades existed. this is reasonable because the definition of protist is a structural simplicity regardless of its metabolic capability. note here that our method correctly classified eukaryotes and also placed spirochaeta and chlamydia in a group separated from the other bacteria. this indicates these parasitic/pathogenic species exhibit anomalous metabolism in comparison with the other species, but further investigation is necessary to confirm its reason. as the second comparison, our approach was compared with the golden standard tree, reconstructed by using concatenated alignment of <dig> universal protein families covering <dig> species <cit> . our method could clearly separate three main domains, bacteria, archaea and metazoan, except nanoarchaeum equitans, which is an obligatory symbiont on ignicoccus. it lacks many essential metabolic pathways and therefore became an orphan branch in our reconstruction. similarly, the reconstruction reflected more on metabolic phenotypes rather than genetic evolution. for example, mycoplasma spp. were located far from the other bacteria and closer to eukaryotes in our tree because they lack many metabolic pathways . this defect was also observed in the comparison with the ‘seed’-based tree. some invertebrate parasites were also grouped with caenorhabditis elegans due to their metabolic similarity of unknown reason. note that systematics of c. elegans is contentious and still unresolved because of its high evolutionary rate <cit> . in summary, our method could reproduce comparable results with the standard tree. in addition, it could extract metabolically anomalous species which could not be easily found by simple genetic comparisons by comparing results with the standard phylogeny. phyletic trees with or without network connectivity to investigate the information gain by considering metabolic network connectivity, we carefully compared our approach with the network topology-based approach <cit> . there are few discrepancies between our and their results. in our approach, some proteobacteria and hyperthermophils were not properly grouped into the same sub-clusters . these clades are labeled as “other independent bacteria” and their proper positions are context-dependent. for this reason, we do not consider our classification inappropriate. on the other hand, we could correctly cluster mycobacterium tuberculosis and m. leprae into gram-positive bacteria. in addition, parasites and symbionts were classified more correctly in our method. in summary, although overall classification was similar, we could better, or at least equally, classify parasitic or symbiotic species in comparison with the results with another phyletic approach. comparison with ec number-based classification clemente et al. investigated the relationship among <dig> photosynthetic bacteria using pseudo-alignment of over <dig> metabolic pathways using the ec hierarchy <cit> . lastly, we compared their results with ours and found <dig> differences from the ec-based phylogeny : the positions of synechocystis and synechococcus , both of which belong to chroococcales together with thermosynechococcus elongates . the misplacement of chroococcales was observed in the work by clemente et al. too and presumably results from the insufficiency of gene annotations in these species . in terms of metabolic similarity, our reconstruction seems more accurate because gloeobacter violaceus and tel were isolated from rocks and hot springs, respectively, whereas the remaining <dig> species were isolated from fresh or sea water. therefore, the two species should be regarded as metabolic out-groups as in our classification. central metabolites we previously argued that metabolic hubs are better identified in the substrate-product graph than in other graph representations, because the approach does not count the frequency of metabolite names in reactions but the number of structural transformations <cit> . the number of transformations roughly reflects the structural variation of catalytic sites of respective enzymes, and therefore reflects the diversity of metabolic capabilities. highlighted metabolites are mentioned in the main text. abbreviations: p … phosphate; acp … acyl carrier proteins. metabolic differences between bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes to elucidate the metabolic differences between the three domains of life, we created a heat map of the substrate-product relationships in <dig> species. in figure <dig> the vertical and horizontal directions are the hierarchically clustered organisms and the substrate-product relationships, respectively. note that substrate-product relationships in species-specific pathways tend to cluster in this scheme. archaea and mycoplasma lack the fatty acid biosynthesis and many other pathways. however, many archaeal pathways are overlooked in the kegg annotations , and their uniqueness is not easily discerned in this analysis. in contrast, plantae and animalia kingdoms in eukaryotes are easy to locate because animals possess drug- and other secondary metabolism, and plants possess unique secondary biosynthetic pathways . discussion our reconstruction using substrate-product relationships efficiently extracted metabolically interesting species in comparison with the standard phylogenetic approach. previous approaches which used metabolic information could also produce informative results <cit> , but the achievements were similar to those found by genetic comparisons <cit> . this is understandable because in their approach metabolic reactions correspond roughly one-to-one to enzymes or genes. why can substrate-product relationships add insights? our approach is more robust to pathway gaps or currency metabolites by evaluating each biochemical transformation with an equal weight. it is also robust to biases by the number of genes or their multiplicity. standard phylogenetic methods can elucidate evolutionary relationship, whereas our approach can locate species of anomalous or interesting metabolism in comparison. therefore, the method is useful in combination with existing phyletic/phylogenetic clustering. our method is also computationally lightweight and scalable, requiring o time for computing pairwise similarity, where n is the number of organisms and v is the maximum number of reactions in one organism. on the contrary, for example, the exponential graph kernel requires o time to compute the similarity <cit> . our computational complexity is equivalent to the recently presented pathway alignment method <cit> , but the method exploits the graph topology and the result is expected to be similar to the one by zhang et al <cit> . lastly, the ‘seed’ approach uses a heuristic to find metabolic seeds <cit> , but an accurate identification of metabolic seeds is np-complete <cit> . there is a huge gap as to the scalability to the other metabolic approaches. algorithms to find phylogeny our method uses a simplistic complete linkage clustering algorithm to reconstruct the phylogeny. this may sound inappropriate but is grounded on our data representation. since the substrate-product relationship disregards the occurrence of metabolites, a frequently appearing reaction type and a rare reaction type are given the same weights. for this reason, standard parsimony or evolutionary distance does not properly reflect the distance between species in our scheme. since we wanted to focus on metabolic differences, the complete linkage method was employed. however, other algorithms should be systematically tested and evaluated for their appropriateness, which is left as our future work. sharing metabolic knowledge through wiki we publicize the substrate-product relationships on a wiki-based site so that readers can check every detail of our analysis. this is especially important in the era of high-throughput data management because more and more research results tend to become irreproducible due to the insufficiency of publicized data or incomplete description of methods. to overcome this difficulty, the traceability and transparency of data and their analysis is important in the evaluation of research. CONCLUSIONS phylogeny was reconstructed by using structural relationship between annotated metabolites. this method is robust to pathway gaps or gene copy numbers, and can extract metabolically anomalous species by comparing the result with other phyletic or phylogenetic reconstructions. through several comparisons, our method could highlight metabolic anomaly in clamydia and spirochaete, both of which are well known parasitic species. the metabolic comparison thus assists understanding of species-environment interaction in combination with other gene-oriented strategies. competing interests there is no competing interests. authors' contributions ma designed, and cwc conducted research under supervision of pcl. cwc and ma wrote the paper together.",

    "prompt": "Highlight the key clinical recommendations in summary form. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND extracellular matrix in the central nervous system is deposited in the extracellular space of the neuropil and around a subset of neurons in the form of distinctive perineuronal nets , coverings of matrix that ensheath perikarya, proximal dendrites and axon initial segments. the components of this matrix are aggregating proteoglycans , termed lecticans, that interact with tenascin and hyaluronan to form complexes which maintain an anionic environment in the extracellular milieu of the cns <cit> . the core proteins of lecticans bear covalently-linked, highly negatively-charged, linear chondroitin sulfate chains that consist of glucuronic acid/n-acetylgalactosamine repeats, sulfated to varying extents at the <dig> and <dig> positions <cit> . methods developed to detect the lecticans in fixed brain sections have employed: 1) antibodies that recognize cs epitopes of the lecticans, 2) antibodies that recognize initial disaccharides of cs chains exposed on the core protein after digestion with chondroitinase abc , 3) labeled lectins that recognize \"selective\" monosaccharide components of cs, and 4) antibodies that recognize the core protein. wisteria floribunda agglutinin is a lectin that binds to terminal n-acetylgalactosamine residues <cit> and decorates various structures, including pnns in the cns, where its reactivity has been well-documented <cit> . various rostral-caudal layers of rat cerebral cortex, and particularly the retrosplenial cortex, thalamus, cerebellum and brain stem are regions that contain numerous pnns prominently labeled by wfa <cit> . in rat neocortex, several types of functional morphology are associated with wfa-reactive pnns <cit> . some data indicate that lectin binding identifies terminal n-acetylgalactosamine present on neuronal cell surface glycoproteins <cit> , whereas others suggest the reactivity seen with wfa may detect cs directly. importantly, wfa binding in nervous tissue co-localizes with signal from antibodies raised against css <cit> , and signal is lost when tissue sections are pre-treated with chase <cit> , suggesting that wfa binds indirectly or directly to cs. thus, wfa reactivity has become a standard method of identifying cs-containing subsets of neurons in the cns that are surrounded by pnns. the lecticans, including brevican, aggrecan and the v <dig> isoform of versican, are highly expressed in the adult brain. the deposition of these lecticans is heterogeneous in the complex ecm of pnns and in the neuropil <cit> . functionally, cs side chains of the lecticans inhibit neurite elongation and even may stabilize synapses in neural networks <cit> . among the lecticans, brevican is highly abundant in brain, where various isoforms are found including a > <dig> kd molecule that carries 1– <dig> cs chains , a core <dig> kd protein without cs , a <dig> kd glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane-bound form, and <dig> kd n-terminal, and <dig> kd c-terminal fragments that are the result of endopeptidase cleavage of the holoprotein. the proteases mainly responsible for cleavage of brevican are glutamyl-endopeptidases, the adamtss . several of these multi-domain proteases <cit> are expressed in brain <cit> and cleave aggrecan <cit> , versican <cit> and brevican <cit> . adamts-cleaved fragments of each lectican are found in untreated nervous tissue extracts <cit> , indicating that adamtss are active proteases capable of cleaving lecticans in a \"normal\" nervous system. fragments of lecticans may be localized in brain tissue sections by using antibodies raised against the terminal, neoepitope sequence of the core protein that is exposed after adamts cleavage <cit> . using an antibody that recognizes the c-terminal residues that are uncovered after adamts-induced release of the n-terminal fragment of brevican <cit> , we noted that the distribution of this immunoreactivity in rat hippocampus was markedly different from wfa reactivity in the same region. we expected that the distribution of the signal from both reagents would be similar, since both n- and c-terminal fragments of brevican appear to be stable after cleavage <cit> , and the preponderance of the c-terminal fragments bear cs chains. thus, the purpose of this study was to describe the distribution and characteristic immunoreactivity for the adamts-cleaved fragment of brevican, and compare this with wfa binding in the rodent cns. the results show a marked discordance between the two, with the breadth of distribution of the adamts-derived brevican fragment being much wider than that of wfa reactivity. RESULTS brevican exists in rodent brain ecm as a holoprotein, in part, with a central region that bears cs chains and globular terminal domains which do not. when brevican is detected on western blot using an n-terminal region antibody, a <dig> kd, n-terminal fragment of brevican is prominent. the predominant protease responsible for this cleavage is adamts-derived, glutamyl-endopeptidase activity. the neoepitope antibody used in these experiments, anti-eavese, represents the c-terminal sequence exposed on the n-terminal, <dig> kd fragment of brevican after adamts cleavage <cit> . to verify that this antibody recognizes adamts-cleaved brevican, the cs-bearing form of brevican was partially purified on a deae anion exchange matrix, and the pg-containing eluant was incubated with active human recombinant adamts <dig> as shown in fig. <dig> when a western blot of the deae extract was probed using an n-terminal region monoclonal, anti-brevican antibody, a smear > <dig> kd was observed . after digestion by adamts <dig> the abundance of the holoprotein was markedly reduced with the appearance of a <dig> kd n-terminal fragment . when probed with polyclonal anti-eavese, little or no anti-eavese immunoreactive fragment was present in the deae extract prior to digestion , however, after cleavage of brevican by human recombinant adamts <dig> the same <dig> kd fragment was apparent . this indicates that n-terminal, adamts-cleaved brevican is recognized by anti-eavese as a <dig> kd, n-terminal fragment, the same fragment detected using a general n-terminal region anti-brevican antibody. in an effort to identify the molecular species in rodent brain detected by the n-terminal region, anti-brevican antibody, those detected by anti-eavese, and by biotin-wfa, cortical homogenates from rat and mouse brain that were either pre-treated with chase or were left untreated were subjected to sds-page and probed with the reagents . when soluble brain extracts were probed with the n-terminal region anti-brevican antibody, the pattern of brevican immunoreactivity included a smear of immunoreactivity found at > <dig> kd, a distinct <dig> kd band and a <dig> kd, n-terminal fragment of brevican . chase treatment eliminated the smear in the mouse sample with an associated increase in the <dig> kd holoprotein without cs in both the mouse and rat samples . chase treatment did not alter the intensity of the <dig> kd fragment, and this same n-terminal fragment was identified when the membrane was probed with anti-eavese or anti-eamese . interestingly, signals observed with streptavidin-hrp to identify proteins on blots that bind to biotin-wfa did not correspond to the molecular weight of any isoform of brevican. in fact, the very high molecular weight smear observed in cortical extract was the only wfa-reactive species modestly diminished after incubation with chase . two of the major bands seen in this blot, however, were non-specific binding signals that were present when membrane was probed with streptavidin-hrp alone . when brain homogenates were differentially centrifuged to obtain \"membrane\" and \"soluble\" fractions, the majority of brevican immunoreactivity was found in the soluble fraction , yet the generalized and adamts derived fragments were found in both fractions . however, the major signals observed after probing with biotin-wfa were found mainly in the \"insoluble\", membrane fraction . these results indicate that brevican isoforms were undetected when probed with biotinylated wfa on membranes. to verify that the effect of chase on the high molecular weight, wfa reactive smear was due solely to degradation of polysaccharides , samples were treated with chase in the absence and presence of protease inhibitor cocktail . in both rat and mouse samples, the pattern of wfa reactivity was identical, whether or not the samples contained protease inhibitor cocktail. these results suggest that wfa does indeed bind to a high molecular weight, cs moiety that is removed after chase treatment, but that is clearly different from brevican. to verify the effectiveness of chase digestion, the same membrane was probed with anti-brevican antibody which showed complete removal of cs chains and a marked increase in the abundance of the core protein in chase-treated samples with no change in the abundance of fragment. this discordance between biotin-wfa and anti-brevican reactivity was not region specific, because when cerebellum, brain stem, temporal lobe and diencephalon extracts were probed with anti-brevican, anti-eamese and biotin-wfa, similar results were observed . nonetheless, biotin-wfa was highly effective at identifying neurons in the cns that were surrounded by pnns, and minor reactivity was also found in the neuropil in both rat and mouse tissue sections . note the abundant pnns in retrosplenial cortex and scattered pnns in parietal cortex. the intense signal was nearly abolished by pre-incubating the tissue section with high concentrations of chase . when streptavidin-alexa <dig> was incubated alone, the section was completely blank . in addition, immunoreactivity for anti-eavese was not influenced at all by chase pre-treatment of a tissue section . these results suggest that whatever moiety is bound by wfa is released upon treatment with chase, yet the n-terminal brevican fragment that does not bear cs chains is unaffected by chase as would be predicted. there are several regions of the brain where there is distinctive and discordant reactivity between wfa and the adamts-derived n-terminal fragment of brevican. particularly, the reticular thalamic nucleus shows prominent staining with wfa in both the rat and mouse whereas the barrels of the ventral posteriolateral and posteriomedial thalamic nuclei are most evident in the rat, compared to the mouse . in contrast, anti-eavese immunoreactivity is weak in the reticular thalamus, but highly prominent between the barrels in the posteriolateral and medial nuclei . there were also striking differences seen in the hippocampus and surrounding cortex as well. mostly the neuropil layers of the dorsal hippocampus contain weak to absent staining with wfa, the exceptions being the ca2-ca <dig> transition region, the molecular layer of the lateral blade and the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus and the fasciola cinereum . however, clear pnns were found in and just adjacent to the pyramidal cell layer in the stratum oriens in ammon's horn. these hippocampal neurons containing pnns were more abundant in the mouse compared to the rat . in addition, the white matter regions of the corpus callosum, external capsule and alveus were all intensely stained by wfa; however, at least a portion of this staining was not eliminated after chase treatment of the sections . staining by anti-eavese showed comparatively intense immunoreactivity in the hippocampal neuropil, especially the stratum oriens, and this staining reached the pyramidal cell layer where there was a cobblestone appearance of this layer . scattered pnns were noted in and around the pyramidal cell layer, similar to wfa staining, and some of these appeared to co-localize with wfa reactivity in the mouse . in the cerebellum, the lobular molecular layer was weakly stained by wfa, the granular layer contained heavily labeled neuropil and pnns and lobule white matter . the white matter was perfectly negative for reaction product to eavese, however, marked immunoreactivity was observed in the granular layer, especially as pnns surrounding the aligned purkinje cells that make up the molecular-granular layer interface . interestingly, these aligned purkinje neurons have previously been shown to be labeled with parvalbumin but not by wfa <cit> . neurons with pnns that contain eavese fragment are not quite as abundant as those identified by wfa, but they appear to have a broad distribution. pnns containing the brevican fragment were broadly distributed in cerebral cortex in layers distinct from pnns surrounded by wfa reactivity, . in murine cerebral cortex, anti-eamese immunoreactivity was found mostly in deep cortical layer iv where sporadic neurons containing wfa-reactive pnns were located. for wfa reactivity, an intensely-stained region was primary somatosensory cortex . however, most neurons with wfa reactive pnns were found in layer iii, and the superficial region of layer iv was deficient in pnns positive for wfa or anti-eamese . both reagents show a similar distribution in the rat . another region of cortex that is intensely labeled by both wfa and anti-eavese was retrosplenial cortex . anti-eavese immunoreactive pnns and intense fiber staining were found in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, the medial septum and in piriform cortex . immunoreactivity for brevican holoprotein was distributed throughout the cns neuropil and in pnns as has been identified by others <cit> . neurons with pnns that contain brevican immunoreactivity are clearly more abundant than those identified by wfa. brevican immunoreactivity was broadly distributed in cerebral cortex in layers distinct from pnns surrounded by wfa reactivity, , although there was a higher percentage of brevican immunoreactive cells that co-localize with wfa compared to that of eavese immunoreactivity. in murine cerebral cortex, anti-brevican immunoreactivity was found in neuropil and pnns of cortical layers ii, iii and deep layer iv and v, whereas the most abundant distribution of neurons containing wfa-reactive pnns were found in layer iii. both reagents showed a similar distribution in the rat . a higher magnification of cortex reveals pnns that are positive for brevican and wfa reactivity . a confocal micrograph of retrosplenial cortex stained with anti-brevican, biotin-wfa and dapi, demonstrated that there are clearly pnns that co-localize and are reactive for both reagents . while many pnns were immunoreactive for brevican, other pnns were reactive toward wfa alone, . pnns reactive with wfa and not brevican, expressed other cs-containing pgs or n-acetylgalactosamine containing molecules. a complete localization of anti-brevican, anti-eavese, and biotinylated wfa pnns and their reactivity in the neuropil of the cns, with semi-quantitation for both reagents may be found in additional files . discussion recent evidence indicates that ecm molecules are important regulators of structural neural plasticity, and regional expression in the cns may be indicative of their role. localization of brevican by immunohistochemistry <cit> and in situ hybridization <cit> within the cns revealed high expression in cerebellar and cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamic nuclei and brain stem. it is localized perisynaptically, it inhibits neurite outgrowth <cit> and it is thought to stabilize neural networks in the adult <cit> . in contrast, conditions that augment the proteolytic cleavage of brevican, especially adamts-induced cleavage, are associated with enhanced neural plasticity <cit> . here, an antibody which selectively recognizes the neoepitope sequence of brevican that is uncovered upon proteolysis by an adamts was used to map the distribution of this fragment in untreated rodent cns. this pattern was compared to the distribution of pnns and neuropil stained by the classical reagent wfa. by both western blot and immunochemistry, the adamts-derived fragment of brevican appeared to be stable, abundant and widely-distributed. there was a discordance between the regional and local expression of classical pnns identified by wfa and regions where the proteolytic fragment of brevican was most highly expressed. in addition, there appeared to be an association between regions with significant deposition of the brevican fragment and areas known to be involved in neural plasiticity , supporting the involvement of adamtss in neural plasticity mechanisms <cit> . wfa staining in these regions was notably low. a significant proportion of total brevican immunoreactivity in brain extracts was found as a fragment formed by proteolytic cleavage of the intact holoprotein. in fact, all antibodies raised against the brevican holoprotein, intended only to detect the holoprotein, inherently recognize either the n- or c-terminal proteolytically-cleaved fragment. proteolysis of lecticans may be an important mechanism by which the nervous system overcomes inhibition exerted by pgs during periods of neural plasticity. after systemic injection of the excitotoxin, kainic acid <cit> or after discrete, unilateral lesion of the entorhinal cortex <cit> , there was an increase in the abundance of an adamts-derived brevican fragment in the dentate gyrus, the target of projections from entorhinal cortex and a region where sprouting occurs in response to the lesion. thus, proteolytic cleavage of pgs may be a key mechanism involved in sprouting and reorganization of the dentate gyrus, whereas intact pgs may promote neural stabilization. there is debate in the literature about which molecule in the cns are labeled by wfa, and here we investigated whether wfa binds to the cs-bearing lectican, brevican. wfa is a lectin that binds to n-acetylgalactosamine-linked α or β to the <dig> or <dig> position of galactose <cit> . wfa is often used as marker for pnns that contain cs chains, yet only indirect evidence suggests that wfa binds to cs polymers. our data show that wfa clearly did not recognize cs-containing brevican on western blot of soluble brain extracts, although there was at least one high molecular weight wfa reactive band that was diminished upon treatment with chase. no corresponding bands were observed at the molecular weights representing any isoform of brevican. in addition, the preponderance of brevican was found in the soluble fraction of brain extract, whereas wfa reactivity was mainly located in the particulate, insoluble fraction after differential centrifugation of brain extract. these results reveal that wfa binds molecules that differ from the lectican, brevican, although the possibility that wfa has a differential affinity for selected sulfated forms of cs cannot be excluded. murakami et al has gathered convincing data that indicates that wfa binds to cell surface glycoproteins. this group showed that terminal n-acetylgalactosamine residues, which are present on neuronal cell surface glycoproteins, are responsible for the pnn reactivity seen with wfa lectin binding <cit> . based on a series of studies using degradative enzymes to define the presence or absence of polysaccharides bound to ecm proteins, their model suggests that perineuronal proteoglycans, such as brevican, bind to these cell surface glycoproteins. chase treatment removes the terminal n-acetylgalactosamine from these glycoproteins, thereby releasing the lectican from its binding partner on the cell surface. this may, in part, account for the discordance in reactivity seen here between brevican and wfa. no direct evidence exists, to our knowledge, of wfa binding to any specific cs-containing pg, including the lecticans. however, the reactivity observed with wfa and antibodies generated against cs chains are similarly distributed in rat brain <cit> , such as in pnns, and binding of wfa to fixed brain sections is diminished or lost after chase treatment <cit> . nonetheless, there may be a host of proteins present in ecm complexes and it is possible, in fact likely, that wfa binds to a molecule that may be indirectly bound to cs. in any case, no biochemical evidence is available to show that wfa binds to large polymeric chains of repeating disaccharides that contain n-acetylgalactosamine. the differential distribution between wfa and the fragment of brevican may relate to their functional environment, i.e. greater abundance of intact cs-bearing pgs chains in regions stained with wfa whereas increased in proteolytic cleavage stained the neoepitope fragment in regions that are capable of undergoing neural plasticity. these findings are intriguing since we observe intense immunoreactivity for the adamts-derived brevican fragment in areas thought to be highly plastic such as the hippocampus. therefore, the relative abundance of cleaved proteoglycans, such as brevican, in a particular region suggest a functional change in surrounding ecm complexes which may contribute to overall neural plasticity. however, the data presented here only begin to uncover the intricate molecular environment around individual neurons that modulate their function and structure. CONCLUSIONS a marked discordance was observed in the regional localization between wfa and brevican or the proteolytically-derived n-terminal fragment of brevican. functionally, this difference may correspond to regions with varied prevalence for neural stability/plasticity.",

encoding genes <cit> . r genes have evolved and clustered on the plant genome through various mechanisms such as tandem and segmental gene duplications, recombination, unequal crossing-over, point mutations, and diversifying selection. recent genome sequencing studies have identified <dig> and <dig> nbs-encoding genes in g. raimondii and g. arboreum, respectively . however, the relationship between the distribution of the nbs genes and resistance qtls or genes is unclear in cotton. the objectives of this study were to perform a qtl analysis of vw resistance from multiple years of replicated tests on a backcross inbred line population of an interspecific upland × pima cross and a meta-analysis of qtls and genes resistant to vw, fw, rkn and rn identified and reported previously. relationships between the resistance qtls and nbs genes on cotton chromosomes were also analyzed. RESULTS qtl mapping for vw resistance in the bil population in the bil population of <dig> lines tested in four years, we detected a total of <dig> qtls for vw resistance based on a linkage map with <dig> polymorphic ssr loci spanning a total genetic distance of <dig> cm as established by yu et al. <cit> . the qtls were distributed on <dig> chromosomes . these qtls included two detected in <dig> and <dig> each, five in <dig> and one in <dig> two vw-qtls were located on chromosome c <dig> within a 25-cm region, while another two qtls were on c <dig> in the same region with the same marker interval. other six qtls were located on c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> with one qtl each. the vw resistance qtls were further mapped onto a consensus map , which shows that vw resistance qtls on these eight chromosomes were also reported by others previously.table <dig> qtl for verticillium wilt resistance detected in a backcross inbred line population of <dig> lines

markers with multiple positions along a chromosome were used as the sole means to position a qtl and the markers did not appear in the cotton marker database those qtl were not able to be placed on the x “vh8-4602” ) map. for this reason some qtl identified from previous studies were not included in this meta-analysis and do not appear on the combined qtl linkage map as shown in table <dig> the lod scores for these qtls ranged from <dig> to <dig> , significant based on permutation tests, and phenotypic variation explained by each qtl ranged from <dig> to <dig> %. six qtls that were from the resistance parent giza <dig> decreased verticillium wilt incidents or severity ratings with higher pve , while other four qtls from the susceptible parent sg <dig> increased verticillium wilt incidents or severity ratings with lower pve . clusters of disease resistance qtls a total of <dig> disease resistance qtls have been reported including <dig> vw resistance qtls identified in this study , with <dig> vw resistance qtls accounting for 63 % of the disease qtls identified in past studies, followed by rkn and fw . chromosomes c <dig> carried the most resistance qtls , followed by c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , and c <dig> . chromosomes c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> each carried 10– <dig> qtls; c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> each carried 6– <dig> qtls; c <dig> carried no resistance qtls; and the remaining chromosomes carried the least number of qtls .table <dig> numbers of quantitative trait loci resistant to verticillium wilt , fusarium wilt , root-knot nematodes , reniform nematodes , bacterial blight and black root rot that were identified in this study and reported in other studies for the distribution of resistance qtls on homeologous chromosomes, four pairs carried more qtls including three pairs with similar numbers . however, c <dig> carried twice qtls than its homeologous counterpart c <dig> . four pairs carried less but with similar numbers of qtls . among other five pairs carrying a few qtls, three a-subgenome chromosomes carried less ; and two other a-subgenome chromosomes carried more . however, the number of qtls carried between homeologous chromosomes was significantly and positively correlated . overall, the a-subgenome carried <dig> qtls, which was slightly fewer than the d-subgenome . however, the difference was not statistically significant . based on the selection criterion that <dig> qtls within a 25-cm region constitute a cluster, <dig> qtl clusters on <dig> chromosomes were identified , and they contained <dig> resistance qtls . the difference in distribution of clusters on the a- and d- subgenomes was not significant . the first region on the chromosomes of the cotton genome contained most qtl clusters , followed by the second region at 25–50 cm with <dig> clusters; and the third region at 60– <dig> cm and the fourth region at 75–100 cm only carried <dig> clusters each. across the cotton genome, the difference in distribution of clusters in the four regions was highly significant . there were no clusters on c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> chromosomes c <dig> and c <dig> each carried <dig> clusters, while c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> each carried <dig> clusters. however, some of the clusters did not contain any qtl hotspot including c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> and c <dig> . some of the clusters may contain qtl hotspots after more qtl mapping results are reported in the future. in the following sections, clusters containing resistance qtl hotspots for each disease will be analyzed in more details.table <dig> resistance qtl clusters and hotspots

distribution of qtl clusters between homeologous chromosomes , c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> did not have any clusters identified, while their counterparts each had one cluster. however, c <dig> had one cluster while its homeologous chromosome c <dig> carried no cluster, nor the homeologous pair c <dig> and c <dig> carried any clusters. homeologous chromosome pair c <dig> and c <dig> each carried one cluster in similar regions with qtls for vw and rkn resistance identified, while other three pairs each carried 2– <dig> clusters. for c <dig> and c <dig> 3– <dig> vw qtls were identified in the similar region , while the second cluster differed in map positions and types of qtls between the two chromosomes. for c <dig> and c <dig> the first cluster had <dig> vw qtls; the second cluster differed in qtl types, while the third cluster had the same qtl type but differed in positions. for c <dig> and c <dig> the first cluster in a similar position only had <dig> qtls in common for the same traits, while the second cluster differed in qtl type and position. interestingly, for homeologous pair c <dig> and c <dig> both had <dig> vw qtls in a similar region . however, c <dig> carried <dig> clusters , while c <dig> carried one cluster with only <dig> qtls. for another homeologous pair c <dig> and c <dig> , both had qtls for vw and fw resistance in the same region . meta-analysis of verticillium wilt and fusarium wilt resistance qtls of a total of <dig> qtls for vw resistance, <dig> and <dig> were distributed on the a- and d- subgenomes, respectively . but the difference in qtls between the two subgenomes was not statistically significant . except for chromosomes c <dig> and c <dig> all chromosomes carried vw resistance qtls. chromosome c <dig> carried the most qtls , followed by c <dig> with <dig> and c <dig> with <dig> chromosomes c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> each carried 11– <dig> qtls, while c <dig> and c <dig> carried 7– <dig> qtls. due to the concentration of qtls in regions, c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , and c <dig> each carried one hotspot with 4– <dig> vw resistance qtls, while c <dig> and c <dig> each carried <dig> hotspots, and c <dig> carried <dig> hotspots . on c <dig> the three hotspots were distributed at 0– <dig> 30– <dig> and 50–65 cm with <dig> <dig> and <dig> qtls, respectively. on c <dig> at two distal regions from the centromere, the two hotspots each contained 4– <dig> qtls. on c <dig> the hotspot at 0–25 cm had <dig> qtls concentrated for vw resistance, while the one at 35–45 cm had only <dig> vw resistance qtls. the above <dig> hotspots contained <dig> individual vw resistance qtls and a few qtls for fw or rkn resistance. of the <dig> vw resistance qtls identified, <dig> were located in disease resistance qtl clusters. all <dig> fw resistance qtls reported on <dig> chromosomes were located in resistance qtl clusters, <dig> of which were located on three chromosomes c <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> . the relevant regions on these three chromosomes each carried a qtl hotspot for fw resistance . it is interesting to note that the same region on c <dig> also carried a qtl hotspot with <dig> qtls for vw resistance. therefore, this region may have resistance genes for both vw and fw. meta-analysis of root-knot nematode and reniform nematode resistance qtls for rkn resistance, a total of <dig> qtls were identified on <dig> chromosomes , <dig> of which were located on c <dig> followed by c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , and c <dig> . chromosomes c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> each carried 1– <dig> rkn resistance qtls, and the remaining chromosomes did not carry any rkn resistance qtls. eight qtl hotspots were identified including two each on c <dig> and c <dig> , and one each on c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , and c <dig> . two major rkn resistance genes or qtls with major effects from auburn 623rkn and its derived lines, as reported previously <cit> , have been confirmed in the hotspot regions of c <dig> with <dig> qtls and c <dig> with <dig> qtls. of the <dig> rkn qtls identified, <dig> and <dig> were located within <dig> resistance qtl clusters and the <dig> rkn resistance qtl hotspots, respectively . of the six qtls reported for reniform nematode resistance, c <dig> carried five, while c <dig> carried one. since the five qtls on c <dig> were scattered along the whole chromosome, there was no qtl hotspot identified. however, c <dig> carried one major dominant resistance gene renlon transferred from g. longicalyx, and it was in a close proximity to the two rkn resistance qtl hotspots with <dig> qtl identified including one of the two major resistance genes for rkn resistance . therefore, this c <dig> region carries important resistance genes for both rkn and rn resistance. qtls for resistance to bacterial blight and black root rot due to the rflp markers used by wright et al. <cit> , the bb resistance qtls could not be placed on the consensus map in this study. however, three reported qtls resistant to brr were mapped onto c <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> of the consensus map . the one on c <dig> was close to a qtl cluster with <dig> rkn and <dig> vw qtls, while the other two qtls were distant from others. identification of linked markers to the disease resistance qtl clusters and hotspot the closely linked ssr markers for the <dig> disease resistance qtl clusters involving <dig> vw resistance hotspots, <dig> fw resistance hotspots and <dig> rkn resistance hotspots are listed in table <dig> the information should be useful to breeders and geneticists. association between number of resistance qtls and number of nucleotide-binding site -encoding genes based on the sequenced genomes in g. raimondii and g. arboreum , <dig> and <dig> nbs-coding genes were identified, respectively <cit> . the significantly higher number of nbs genes in g. raimondii than in g. arboreum may explain why the d subgenome carried more disease resistance qtls than the a subgenome in the tetraploid cotton. the number of nbs genes and the number of qtls identified on the <dig> d-subgenome chromosomes were positively correlated , while the correlation was significant with the number of total disease resistance qtls on homeologous a-subgenome chromosomes . the sum of qtls in <dig> pairs of homeologous chromosomes was also significantly correlated with the number of nbs-coding genes . the correlation with the number vw qtls on a- and d- subgenome chromosomes was also positive but insignificant ; however, the correlation with the number of rkn qtls on the a subgenome chromosomes was significant . therefore, there is a trend that the more nbs-encoding genes a chromosome carries, the more disease resistance qtls it has. for example, chromosome <dig> carried the most number of nbs genes , and its homeologous pair of upland cotton carried a total of <dig> qtls . chromosomes <dig> and <dig> in d <dig> carried <dig> and <dig> nbs genes, respectively, and their homeologous pairs carried a total of <dig> and <dig> qtls, respectively. chromosomes <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> in d <dig> contained a minimum numbers of nbs genes , their corresponding tetraploid chromosomes also carried the least numbers of qtls . however, three chromosomes in d <dig> also had high numbers of nbs genes , but their tetraploid counterparts only carried moderate numbers of qtls . surprisingly, chromosomes <dig> in d <dig> carried a small number of nbs genes , but its tetraploid counterparts carried a high number of qtls . furthermore, the number of nbs genes was significantly correlated with the number of qtl clusters on a- and d- subgenome chromosomes and the sum of the homeologous chromosomes . for example, chromosomes <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> with high numbers of nbs genes each had a total of 3– <dig> clusters in their tetraploid counterparts. since nbs genes on these chromosomes with high numbers of nbs genes are clustered, the results indicate that the disease resistance qtl clusters may be in part determined by nbs gene clusters. however, the reverse is true for chromosome <dig> with only <dig> nbs genes in the d <dig> genome, while its tetraploid counterparts carried <dig> clusters. this result indicates that either these nbs genes may have pleiotropic effects on multiple diseases or other genes on the chromosome are involved in quantitative resistance. discussion difficulties in screening cotton for vw resistance in this study, a bil population of <dig> lines was tested in 2– <dig> replications through 4-years replicated field tests. disease resistance was determined by an average severity rating from 54– <dig> individual plants for each genotype, therefore rendering low experimental errors than most previous vw resistance studies. however, only <dig> vw resistance qtls on <dig> chromosomes were identified. on two chromosome regions, two qtls were identified in the same or similar regions. on the <dig> chromosomes where the <dig> qtls were mapped, vw resistance qtls were also mapped by previous studies. in fact, <dig> qtls were mapped onto three chromosomes with vw qtl hotspots. therefore, the results in this study demonstrated a moderate level of consistency in qtl mapping for vw resistance based on the multiple years of replicated studies. the results also demonstrated difficulties in vw resistance studies even if inbred lines are evaluated for vw resistance in multiple replicated field tests with or without inoculations. as zhang et al. <cit> noted, it is difficult to reliably identify vw and fw resistance qtls. there are a number of contributing factors to the complication of disease resistance studies. first, many early segregating populations were used in disease resistance qtl mapping, which did not allow repeated evaluation of the same genotypes from multiple individuals in multiple replications and multiple environments. experimental errors were understandably higher. second, vw and fw disease infections are highly sensitive to environmental and developmental factors, and even artificial inoculations could not achieve similar disease infections in the same genotypes <cit> . thirdly, an artificial grading system for disease severity is often used, rendering it very difficult to quantitatively and accurately phenotype cotton responses to the diseases. fourth, there exist interactions of genotype with environment, strains of a pathogen, and evaluation methods, resulting in different disease responses of the same genotypes to different strains of pathogens under different environmental conditions or using different inoculation methods. furthermore, most disease resistance qtls have low contributions to disease resistance, which could not be detected in many environmental conditions where experimental errors for resistance screening are higher. finally, low genome coverage of molecular markers in many mapping studies does not allow a genome-wide detection of qtls with a high resolution, resulting in different qtls identified from different genetic populations evaluated under different environmental and screening conditions. all of these issues call for reliable screening techniques and phenotyping of disease resistance in mapping populations with multiple individuals in each genotype using multiple replicated tests. of course, genome-wide markers should be developed for better genome coverage, so more qtls with high accumulated pve will be detected. genetic basis of vw resistance the complexity in mapping qtls for vw resistance in cotton is further illustrated from the meta-analysis of vw resistance qtls reported previously. out of <dig> qtls reported, except for c <dig> and c <dig> where no qtls for vw resistance were reported, all other chromosomes had qtls mapped, although <dig> chromosomes carried only 1– <dig> vw qtls. the identification of <dig> vw resistance qtl hotspots on <dig> chromosomes further demonstrated the complexity in studying the genetic basis of vw resistance in cotton, because selection of qtls for vw resistance breeding and further genetic and genomic studies will be difficult. however, more attention should be paid to several vw qtl populated hotspots, such as the hotspot with <dig> vw qtls on c <dig> at 35–60 cm and three hotspots with <dig> vw qtls on c <dig> at 0–75 cm. but, the most notable is the hotspot with <dig> vw qtls on c <dig> at 0–25 cm, because this region may also confer resistance to fw and rkn since 1– <dig> resistance qtls to fw and rkn were identified. several other regions also deserve more attention. the vw qtl hotspot on c <dig> is interesting, because a fw qtl hotspot was within the same region, and a rkn qtl hotspot was also in the proximity. therefore, this region may share genes responsive to vw, fw and rkn. a region on c <dig> is also very important in conferring resistance to multiple diseases. in a broad region , <dig> rkn qtls, <dig> fw qtls, <dig> vw qtl, and <dig> major rn resistance gene were mapped. another region with the second most frequent rkn qtls was on c <dig> in this region, a major gene or qtl was identified for rkn resistance <cit> . however, this region appeared to confer resistance to only rkn, because there were very few qtls identified for resistance to other diseases. chromosome c <dig> also deserves more consideration, because it carried two qtl hotspots for vw resistance, <dig> qtl for rkn resistance and also <dig> qtls for reniform nematode resistance. however, the rn resistance qtls were scattered along the chromosome and not contained in any of the hotspots. except for the hotspot in the same region on c <dig> for vw and fw resistance, other hotspots including <dig> hotspots for rkn resistance did not overlap with any of the resistance qtl hotspots for vw and fw. in fact, the numbers of qtls for vw, fw and rkn on different chromosomes were not correlated . therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the resistance mechanisms for the three diseases are likely different. however, the linked markers for <dig> vw hotspots, <dig> fw hotspots and <dig> rkn hotspots should be highly useful in choosing chromosome regions with consistent qtls for marker-assisted selection and high resolution mapping of resistance qtls and genes. nbs-coding genes and disease resistance qtls in rice and other plant species, many disease resistance genes were cloned and isolated <cit> . it is known that most of the disease resistance genes belong to a super gene family encoding nucleotide-binding site domains. through resistance gene analog rga-based marker analysis, many rgas in cotton were mapped <cit> . except that a rga marker was found to be linked to a rkn resistance gene in a study <cit> , no other studies have associated nbs genes with disease resistance in cotton. based on the current study, the number of disease resistance qtls and qtl clusters including hotspots identified on chromosomes seemed to be positively correlated with the number of nbs genes. however, on several other chromosomes with very few nbs genes, substantially higher numbers of resistance qtls were identified. it is likely that in some qtl cluster and hotspot regions, multiple nbs genes are located, and different nbs genes may confer resistance to different diseases. since nbs-coding r genes are normally major mendelian resistance genes <cit> , the positive correlation of qtl clusters and hotspots identified in the current meta-analysis with nbs genes indicates that these qtl regions maybe contain major resistance r genes. in fact, major disease resistance genes or qtls with major effects have been identified for vw, fw, rkn, rn, and bb . for example, two major resistance genes were identified for rkn ; and more than <dig> major genes resistant to various races of bb including one on chromosome <dig> have been reported <cit> . others major resistance genes include one resistant to southwestern cotton rust and two resistant to cotton leaf crumple virus <cit> . recent studies have shown that some major disease resistance r genes in other plants are co-localized with resistance qtls, suggesting weak or defeated effects of r genes or their tight linkage with other genes responsible for quantitative resistance loci <cit> . there are other genes with different functions identified recently that may be responsible for quantitative disease resistance <cit> . further studies are needed to discern the relationship between disease resistance qtls and nbs genes in cotton. because a 25 cm region may contain 700– <dig> genes based on the sequenced diploid cotton genomes, identification of candidate genes for the resistance qtl clusters is currently impractical in this study. in the future, positional candidate gene approaches in relating nbs genes to resistance qtls will be possible once the tetraploid cotton genome is sequenced and the qtl clusters are narrowed to 5–10 cm regions through a high resolution mapping strategy using large genetic populations. materials and methods materials an interspecific backcross inbred line population comprising of <dig> lines was used in this study. the bils were developed from a cross between upland cotton sg <dig> and g. barbadense giza <dig> through two generations of backcrossing using sg <dig> as the recurrent parent followed by four generations of self-pollination. during the bil development, each bc1f <dig> plant was used as male parent to backcross with sg <dig> to derive bc2f <dig> in each bc1f1-derived bc2f <dig> progeny, one single representative plant was selected for seed increase and used as the seed source for subsequent field tests. the <dig> bils and the two parents were planted in the experimental farm of china cotton research institute, chinese academy of agricultural sciences, anyang, henan province in <dig> <dig> and <dig> the fields used to evaluate vw resistance were grown with cotton yearly and heavily infected with race <dig> of v. dahliae kleb. to further evaluate vw resistance, an artificially inoculated field nursery with the vw strain from anyang was used in <dig> the <dig> entries were arranged in a randomized complete block design with two , three and four replications . seeds were sown in single row plots in april and crop managements followed local recommendations. the plot length was <dig> m with a row-spacing of <dig> m and seedlings were thinned to 27– <dig> plants per plot. vw resistance screening all the individual plants in each plot were evaluated for vw resistance based on a system established as a national standard for screening cotton for vw resistance in china <cit> , as the following, <dig> no symptom <dig> <25 % chlorotic/necrotic leaves <dig> 25–50 % chlorotic/necrotic leaves <dig> 50–75 % chlorotic/necrotic leaves <dig> >75 % chlorotic/necrotic leaves <dig> complete defoliation or plant death the number of infected plants was divided by the total number of plants screened to calculate disease incidence , and average disease severity rating-vwr, i.e., the sum of was divided by the total number of plants <cit> . the average disease severity rating on the 0– <dig> scale was converted to the disease index on a 0–100 % scale as the ratio between the average severity rating and the highest rating . dna extraction, maker analysis, and map construction the genomic dnas were extracted from young leaves of the <dig> individual bil lines and the two parents using a quick method <cit> . simple sequence repeat markers were used to construct a genetic map for the bil population using joinmap <dig> <cit> and the linkage map was published elsewhere <cit> . qtl mapping for qtl mapping, the icimapping software , an integrated software for building linkage maps and mapping qtls which can handle various mapping populations including bils in this study, was used <cit> . see yu et al. <cit> for details. the qtl nomenclature followed mccouch et al. <cit> in that a qtl designation begins with “q”, followed by an abbreviation of the trait name, year, chromosome name, and finally a serial number. meta-analysis of qtls as of the end of january <dig> results of disease resistance qtl mapping from all publicly accessible journals were obtained, in addition to a few papers published in chinese in china. this study used <dig> published papers regarding mapping of resistance to vw, fw, rkn, rn, bacterial blight and black root rot with <dig> qtls reported . for vw resistance qtl mapping, <dig> studies were included. for fw qtl mapping, <dig> studies were included. for rkn qtl

using biomercator v <dig> software . briefly, using biomercator v <dig> the map file and qtl file from each study were loaded into the software in the tab delimited format, and were then mapped to the consensus map <cit> obtained from the cotton marker database <cit> . since the map file contains distances between markers on each chromosome, each population’s qtls were mapped to the consensus map separately. a detailed description in the meta-analysis of resistance qtls can be found in said et al. <cit> . to reduce errors in declaring a qtl, four or more qtls in an interval of 25 cm were considered a consistent qtl region. if there was more than one trait involved in the qtls, the region is called a qtl cluster. otherwise, it is called a qtl hotspot for the region involving only one single trait. correlation analysis between number of qtls and nucleotide-binding site -encoding genes distributed on chromosomes based on the recent completion of genome sequencing of g. raimondii and g. arboreum , nbs-encoding genes were identified. for example, chromosomes <dig> through <dig> of the g. raimondii genome carried <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> respectively <cit> . a simple correlation analysis was performed between the number of the nbs genes and the number of total qtls and qtls resistant to individual diseases. coefficients of correlation were tested for significance at the degree of freedom of <dig> or <dig> . CONCLUSIONS in this study, linkage mapping of verticillium wilt resistance and meta-analysis of qtls were used to map qtl clusters and hotspots for resistance to vw, fusarium wilt, root-knot nematodes and reniform nematodes in cotton. in a four-year replicated test of a backcross inbred line population for vw resistance, <dig> resistance qtls were mapped based on a <dig> cm linkage map with <dig> ssr markers, which has added useful information to the understanding of the genetic basis of vw resistance in cotton. twenty-eight disease resistance qtl clusters and <dig> hotspots identified from a total of <dig> reported qtls in <dig> papers and linked ssr markers provide important information for marker-assisted selection and high resolution mapping of resistance qtls and genes. the non-overlapping of most resistance qtl hotspots for different diseases indicates that their resistances are controlled by different genes. additional file additional file 1: mapping of quantitative trait loci for verticillium wilt resistance in a backcross inbred line population of × sg <dig> bc 2 f 4 . abbreviations bbbacterial blight bilbackcross inbred line brrblack root rot fwfusarium wilt nbsnucleotide binding site qtlquantitative trait locus rknroot-knot nematodes rnreniform nematodes snpsingle nucleotide polymorphism ssrsimple sequence repeat vwverticillium wilt competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors’ contributions jfz and jwy conceived the study. jwy, wfp and xll performed the field experiments. jis and mzs performed the meta-analysis of qtls. jfz and ss wrote the manuscripts. all authors read and approved the manuscripts.",

variety of eukaryotic organisms. multiple copine homologs exist in each of paramecium, arabidopsis, c. elegans, mice, and humans. copines are characterized as having two c <dig> domains at the n-terminal region followed by an \"a domain\" at the c-terminal region. the \"a domain\" is similar in sequence to the von willebrand a domain found in integrins. following the a domain, copines have a variable length c-terminal domain, which may confer unique characteristics to the different copine family members <cit> . the c <dig> domain is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding motif originally identified in protein kinase c. single and multiple copies of c <dig> domains are found in a large number of eukaryotic proteins. most proteins containing a single c <dig> domain are involved in signaling pathways; examples include protein kinases, lipid kinases, phospholipases, and gtpase activating proteins. in contrast, most proteins that have multiple c <dig> domains are involved in membrane trafficking. some examples of multiple c <dig> domain proteins are synaptotagmin, rabphilin, doc <dig> each of which have two c <dig> domains, and munc <dig> which has three c <dig> domains <cit> . the vwa domain is named from the von willebrand factor, a plasma and extracellular matrix protein. vwa domains have been studied in integrins and several extracellular matrix proteins and appear to function as protein-binding domains <cit> . copines were the first intracellular proteins to be identified as having a vwa domain <cit> . however, a recent sequence database search for vwa domains revealed that vwa domains are found in several other intracellular proteins present in all eukaryotes <cit> . copines possess several characteristics that suggest they may have a role in membrane trafficking. as described above, copines have two c <dig> domains, similar to other membrane trafficking proteins. biochemical studies have shown that copines, like other c <dig> domain containing proteins, bind to phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner <cit> . in addition, the protein chromobindin <dig> which binds to the secretory granules of chromaffin cells in the presence of calcium, has been identified as a copine <cit> . however, no functional data exists to indicate a role for copines in membrane trafficking. although copines possess two c <dig> domains, studies with human copines indicate that copines are involved in calcium-dependent signaling pathways and are therefore, more functionally related to the single c <dig> domain proteins <cit> . using the a domain of several human copine proteins as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse embryo cdna library, tomsig et al. <cit> isolated a wide variety of proteins, several of which are components of intracellular signaling pathways. many of these interactions between the copine a domains and their target proteins were verified in in vitro pull-down assays. the authors hypothesized that copines may act to localize target proteins to a particular membrane in response to calcium. to test this idea, they used an in vitro assay to show that full-length copines were able to recruit target proteins to membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. in an in vivo assay, tomsig et al. <cit> used a dominant negative mutant copine construct consisting of only the a domain to inhibit signaling from the tnf-α receptor in human embryonic kidney <dig> cells. copine mutants have been isolated in both arabidopsis <cit> and c. elegans <cit> . arabidopsis plants with loss of function alleles of one of the copines, cpn1/bon <dig> exhibit mutant phenotypes only under certain environmental conditions. copine mutant plants are miniature at 22°c, but grow normally at 28°c. the miniature phenotype is due to a reduction in both the size and the number of cells in the plant <cit> . in low humidity conditions, copine mutant plants are also smaller and display abnormal regulation of cell death, with small necrotic lesions on the leaves, an accelerated programmed cell death response, and increased resistance to pathogens <cit> . in c. elegans, mutations in nem- <dig> which encodes a copine, are capable of suppressing loss of function alleles of gon- <dig> suppression of gon- <dig> by nem- <dig> requires a low level of gon- <dig> activity. gon- <dig> is a cation channel required for postembryonic gonadal cell divisions and loss of function mutations in gon- <dig> lead to a sterile phenotype. the nem- <dig> mutant strains do not exhibit any obvious phenotype <cit> . the data from these copine mutant studies in arabidopsis and c. elegans suggest that copines may function in a wide variety of calcium-mediated signaling pathways that control processes such as cell growth, cell division, and cell death. to further investigate the function of copines, we have chosen to study copines in the simple eukaryote dictyostelium discoideum and have identified six copines genes in the dictyostelium genome. dictyostelium provides an ideal system for studying copine function for several reasons. first, although dictyostelium lives as a single-celled amoeba, it contains multiple copine homologs and a comparison of each of the dictyostelium copines with the other five indicates that they share only 28–60% identity in amino acid sequence. therefore, the dictyostelium copine genes are diverse in sequence and may carry out distinct functions. to study the function of each copine gene, single and multiple gene knockout mutants can be created by homologous recombination. second, dictyostelium are highly motile, phagocytic cells, possessing organelles and membrane trafficking pathways similar to mammalian cells. therefore, dictyostelium serves as a good model for studying membrane trafficking and a particularly good model for many of the phagocytic cells found in human tissues, in which copines are highly expressed <cit> . third, dictyostelium executes a simple 24-hour developmental program to form multicellular fruiting bodies and thus, dictyostelium provides a simplistic model to study copine function in programmed cell death and development. our studies have focused on cpna, the most abundant copine gene cdna in the dictyostelium cdna sequencing project database <cit> . to characterize cpna in dictyostelium, we have determined the protein expression pattern of cpna during development, examined the calcium-dependent membrane binding properties of cpna, and expressed a gfp-tagged version of cpna in wildtype dictyostelium to determine the intracellular location of cpna. RESULTS identification of six copine genes in dictyostelium to identify copine homologs in dictyostelium, first we probed the cdna sequence database from the dictyostelium cdna sequencing project at the university of tsukaba in japan <cit> with the human copine i sequence. we initially found several different cdna clones that exhibited some homology to human copine i. we obtained two full-length cdna clones, sequenced them, and named the corresponding genes, cpna and cpnb . the open reading frame of the cpna cdna encodes a <dig> amino acid protein, while the cpnb cdna encodes a <dig> amino acid protein. the complete cdna sequences of cpna and cpnb revealed two n-terminal c <dig> domains followed by an a domain characteristic of the copine family . we then used the cdna sequences of cpna and cpnb to search both genomic and cdna sequence databases for additional copine genes. we used these sequences to identify and predict amino acid sequences for four additional copine genes within the dictyostelium genome. more recently, with the sequencing of the dictyostelium genome complete, cpna-cpne have been identified by the dictyostelium sequencing center gene predictions <cit> . the alignment of the amino acid sequences derived from cdna sequences of cpna and cpnb, along with the predicted amino acid sequences of the four additional copine genes are shown in fig. <dig> all six copine genes contain the characteristic two c <dig> domains followed by an a domain and show 28–60% amino acid identity. conserved sequences among the dictyostelium copine proteins are found along the entire length of each protein . however, cpna and cpne contain unique additional sequences not found in each of the other five copine genes. cpna has a longer c-terminal sequence, while cpne has a longer n-terminal sequence . developmental expression pattern of cpna because the cpna gene was the most represented copine gene in the dictyostelium cdna sequencing project database, we have focused our work on cpna. to determine if cpna expression is developmentally regulated, we placed dictyostelium cells of the nc4a <dig> strain, which we refer to as \"wildtype,\" in starvation buffer and allowed them to develop on filters for <dig> hours. at <dig> hour intervals, we harvested protein and rna samples and then used western blotting to detect cpna and rt-pcr to detect cpna mrna in these samples . western blots of whole cell samples using purified cpna antibodies raised against a bacterially expressed fragment of cpna recognized a protein band at the predicted molecular weight of cpna, along with some smaller molecular weight protein bands . the <dig> kda cpna band was observed in whole cell samples from each stage of development. levels of cpna are fairly steady throughout development, with slightly more cpna found in vegetative cells and at the <dig> hr time point when cells are beginning culmination and slightly less cpna found at the <dig> hr time point when cells have developed into mature fruiting bodies. the <dig> kda band recognized by the cpna antiserum on western blots using whole cell samples from wildtype cells was absent from whole cell samples made from cpna- null cells . in addition to determining the presence of cpna protein, we used rt-pcr to detect the presence of cpna mrna during development. we used rt-pcr to amplify a small region of cpna across an intron to control for any contaminating dna. mrna from cpna was amplified from each stage of development , suggesting that the cpna transcript is present throughout development. cpna binds membranes in a calcium-dependent manner in vitro because copines have two copies of the calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding c <dig> domain and arabidopsis and mammalian copines have been shown to bind membranes in a calcium-dependent manner <cit> , we tested whether cpna also possessed this ability. we began by trying to express the full length cpna in bacteria as a gst-fusion protein; however, the bacteria did not express the fusion protein in any appreciable level. therefore, we expressed and purified a fragment of cpna containing only the first c <dig> domain. we used this fragment in in vitro phospholipid binding assays. the purified cpna fragment was incubated with bovine brain lipid liposomes in the presence of calcium or egta and then centrifuged to pellet the liposomes. the pellets were analyzed by sds-page. cpna-c2a pelleted with the liposomes in the presence of calcium, but was nearly absent in liposomes pelleted in egta , demonstrating that the first c <dig> domain of cpna possesses the ability to bind lipids in a calcium-dependent manner. previous studies with synaptotagmin, a protein with two c <dig> domains, have shown that the lipid binding behavior of c <dig> domains is highly dependent on the type of phospholipids present and whether they are independent or paired with another c <dig> domain <cit> . in addition, the two individual c <dig> domains of a neurally expressed mammalian copine have been shown to exhibit different calcium-dependent binding properties from each other <cit> . thus, it is important to investigate the membrane binding properties of the full length cpna containing both c <dig> domains. therefore, we examined whether endogenous cpna binds to native dictyostelium cellular membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. wildtype dictyostelium cells were disrupted with passage through a french press, unbroken cells were pelleted, and then all membranes were pelleted by high-speed centrifugation in the presence of calcium or egta. the pellets and supernatants were then analyzed by western blotting using the cpna antisera. in the presence of calcium, cpna was in the membrane pellet and completely absent from the supernatant . in the presence of egta, cpna was mostly in the supernatant with a small fraction of the protein pelleting with membranes . these findings indicate that endogenous cpna binds to native dictyostelium membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. gfp-cpna binds to membranes in a calcium-dependent manner in vitro to determine the localization of cpna within the cell, we expressed a gfp-tagged version of cpna in wildtype dictyostelium cells. gfp-cpna is expressed under the actin <dig> promoter and is expressed at much higher levels than the native cpna . the overexpression of gfp-cpna did not result in any easily identifiable phenotypes. cells expressing gfp-cpna grow normally in suspension and execute a normal developmental program . the gfp was fused to the n-terminus to decrease the likelihood of the gfp interfering with the binding of target proteins to cpna. however, because the c <dig> domains are in the n-terminal half of the protein, we tested whether gfp-cpna has similar membrane binding properties to the endogenous cpna. we performed the same membrane binding experiment as described above with cells expressing gfp-cpna. gfp-cpna behaved similarly to the native cpna, with gfp-cpna nearly absent from the supernatant in the presence of calcium . the small amount of gfp-cpna found in the supernatant in the presence of calcium is most likely due to the overexpression of gfp-cpna. because we had problems with proteolysis of gfp-cpna, we also analyzed the pellets and supernatants using a monoclonal antibody to gfp . these results indicate the addition of gfp to the n-terminus of cpna does not disrupt the calcium-dependent membrane binding activity of cpna . gfp-cpna transiently localizes to the plasma membrane and intracellular vacuoles in a small subset of starved cells in vegetative cells, gfp-cpna was found throughout the cytoplasm without any specific localization to membranes. this was not surprising given that cpna is a soluble cytoplasmic protein. it is known that cells that have been starved respond to camp with a transient rise in cytosolic calcium concentration <cit> ; therefore, we also imaged starved cells. cells that have been starved for a several hours express camp receptors and use the synthesis and secretion of camp to signal their developmental program. after a few hours in starvation buffer, a few scattered cells will begin secreting periodic pulses of camp. other cells undergo chemotaxis in response to the waves of extracellular camp, leading to the formation of aggregates of cells that differentiate into multicellular fruiting bodies consisting of a mass of encapsulated spores sitting atop a long thin stalk <cit> . we placed cells expressing gfp-cpna in starvation buffer on glass bottom dishes and imaged cells at various times after the initiation of starvation with a laser scanning confocal microscope. scanning starved cells every <dig> seconds, we observed that a small subset of cells beginning at 3– <dig> hours of starvation exhibited a very transient translocation of gfp-cpna from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and then back to the cytosol . cells that displayed this transient localization of gfp-cpna to membranes were difficult to find; typically, only 1– <dig> cells in a field of <dig> cells exhibited this behavior. however, cells exhibiting this behavior were found more frequently when the cells were starved for longer periods of time. in most cells, the membrane localization of gfp-cpna was observed to last for only a few seconds before returning to the cytosol. this transient membrane localization of gfp-cpna was frequently observed to occur multiple times in the same cell . it is not clear whether cells would continue to produce these oscillations of gfp-cpna localization over a long period of time because we were only able to image cells for a few minutes before the cells became damaged by the laser. in most cells, we also observed localization to intracellular vacuolar structures . in addition, we often observed a centrally located fluorescent dot for a few seconds after the gfp-cpna had returned to the cytoplasm . the cells that exhibited this transient gfp-cpna membrane localization were often close to each other on the culture dish. after 9– <dig> hours of starvation, several cells within a small aggregate or adjacent to each other were seen to exhibit gfp-cpna membrane localization at different times over several minutes . one cell exhibiting transient membrane localization of gfp-cpna found within a small aggregate is shown in fig. 4c . in cells starved for 4– <dig> hours, membrane localization of gfp-cpna occurred for ~1– <dig> seconds, while in cells starved for 8– <dig> hours, membrane localization sometimes occurred for longer periods of time ranging from ~1– <dig> seconds. in an effort to determine if the transient localization of gfp-cpna to membranes is triggered by camp being secreted by the starved cells, we tried globally treating starved cells with exogenous camp, which is known to produce a transient rise in intracellular calcium concentration. however, we did not observe a change in gfp-cpna localization in starved cells when treated with camp. membrane localization of gfp-cpna is dependent on calcium during disruption of live cells a stable membrane localization of gfp-cpna was observed after prolonged exposure to the intense light of the laser of the confocal microscope in vegetative and starved cells. dictyostelium cells are very sensitive to the heat produced by fluorescence microscopy. they lose their shape and adherence, becoming round and eventually bursting if exposed to the light for more than tens of seconds with a fluorescence microscope or frequent scanning over tens of minutes with a laser scanning confocal microscope. using the light sensitivity of dictyostelium to our advantage, we designed an assay to visualize gfp-cpna in disrupted cells. first, we placed cells expressing gfp-cpna or gfp alone in water, which resulted in an increase in the size of contractile vacuoles and an increase in the rate of plasma membrane disruption. we then scanned the cells every <dig> seconds using confocal microscopy with 100% laser power . over time the cells sustained plasma membrane ruptures, allowing soluble cytoplasmic proteins to diffuse out of the cell and into the water. in these broken cells, the gfp-cpna was seen labeling the plasma membrane and intracellular vacuoles . in control cells expressing gfp alone, once the cell bursts, the gfp diffused into the water and the fluorescence disappeared with no labeling of membranes . to test whether the binding of gfp-cpna to membranes in these broken cells is calcium-dependent, we repeated this experiment, but this time adding egta to the water. once the cells burst, the gfp-cpna did not bind to membranes, but diffused into the water and disappeared . gfp-cpna binding to membranes was abolished by the egta indicating that the membrane binding activity of gfp-cpna to the plasma membrane and intracellular vacuoles in these disrupted cells is calcium-dependent. in addition, binding of gfp-cpna to the plasma membrane and intracellular vacuoles in these broken cells placed in water was similar whether or not additional calcium was added to the water. because the calcium concentration of millipore purified water is typically less than <dig> μm, this suggests that gfp-cpna's sensitivity to calcium is similar to mammalian copines, which have been shown to exhibit half maximal binding to membranes between <dig> and <dig> μm calcium in vitro <cit> . gfp-cpna labels the plasma membrane and intracellular vacuoles in fixed cells in fixed cells, gfp-cpna localized to the plasma membrane and intracellular membranous structures. images of fixed cells look similar to images of disrupted cells and the subset of starved live cells that display the transient membrane localization of gfp-cpna . thus, we used fixed cells to identify the gfp-cpna labeled intracellular vacuolar structures. intracellular structures labeled with gfp-cpna in fixed cells included mainly rounded or vacuole type structures and less frequently tubular structures. the vacuolar structures were heterogeneous in size and found throughout the cytoplasm . the shape and size of some of these gfp-cpna labeled structures is consistent with contractile vacuoles. the contractile vacuole system primarily functions in osmoregulation. contractile vacuoles form a membranous network that consists of ducts, cisternae, and bladders. the bladders transiently form pores with the plasma membrane to expel water <cit> . using confocal microscopy, we found several cells that contained gfp-cpna labeled structures with what looked like attachments to the plasma membrane . these gfp-cpna labeled structures forming attachments with the plasma membrane could be bladders caught in the act of expelling water. gfp-cpna labels contractile vacuoles in fixed cells to definitively identify some of the gfp-cpna labeled structures as contractile vacuoles, cells expressing gfp-cpna were placed in water to cause an increase in the number and size of the contractile vacuoles. the cells were then fixed and imaged using differential interference contrast and widefield fluorescence microscopy. cells placed in water usually had one or two enlarged vacuoles that could be seen in the dic images as smooth concave vacuoles . when imaged using fluorescence microscopy, these same vacuoles were outlined in gfp-cpna . calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein that is greatly enriched on contractile vacuole membranes in fixed dictyostelium cells <cit> . using a monoclonal antibody to calmodulin, we performed immunofluorescence studies to label contractile vacuoles with rhodamine . the calmodulin antibody labeled contractile vacuoles corresponded exactly with some of the gfp-cpna labeled structures . however, there were many more gfp-cpna labeled structures than calmodulin antibody labeled structures, indicating that only some of the gfp-cpna labeled structures are part of the contractile vacuole system. the numerous gfp-cpna labeled structures not identified as contractile vacuoles are most likely part of the endolysosomal pathway, which includes endosomes, lysosomes, and postlysosomes. postlysosomes are terminal organelles of the endocytic pathway that fuse with the plasma membrane to expel their contents <cit> . the structures with attachments to the plasma membrane shown in fig. <dig> could also be postlysosomes in the act of exocytosis. gfp-cpna labels endolysosomal organelles and phagosomes in fixed cells to identify some of the gfp-cpna labeled structures as part of the endolysosomal system, we used red fluorescent nanobeads to label endosomes and lysosomes. cells take up the beads by the processes of endocytosis and macropinocytosis. endocytic vesicles form endosomes that become lysosomes, which eventually become postlysosomes <cit> . therefore, organelles all along the endocytic pathway are labeled with the red beads. cells expressing gfp-cpna treated with red nanobeads were fixed and imaged for both fluorophores simultaneously with confocal microscopy. to visualize the gfp-cpna labeled structures more clearly, example images of gfp-cpna expressing cells incubated with red nanobeads are displayed twice in fig. <dig> first, only the fluorescent signal from the gfp-cpna is shown , and to the right, both the green and red signals are shown . in all cells examined, the red nanobeads corresponded exactly with gfp-cpna, in the case of small vesicles, or were surrounded by an outline of gfp-cpna, in the case of larger vacuoles. for the moderately sized vacuoles, it was sometimes necessary to change the plane of focus to image the gfp-cpna labeled outline surrounding the beads. not all gfp-cpna labeled structures contained red beads; this is perhaps due to the fact that some of the structures are contractile vacuoles and that some are endosomes/lysosomes that do not contain beads. to get clear images of the gfp-cpna labeled structures, it is necessary to flatten cells with a thin layer of agarose. however, flattening cells loaded with too many beads resulted in destroying the cells before fixation. therefore, to view both gfp-cpna and beads simultaneously, we had to use a bead concentration low enough so that cells remained intact during flattening, which resulted in many but not all organelles of the endolysosomal system containing beads. because it has been suggested that copines may be involved in phagocytosis <cit> , we also looked at whether gfp-cpna localizes to the phagosome. cells were fed alexa fluor-594-labeled yeast, fixed, and both fluorophores were imaged simultaneously using confocal microscopy. an example of one cell is shown in fig. <dig> . again, for clarity, the cell is displayed twice; first only the fluorescent signal from the gfp-cpna is shown , and to the right, both the green and red signals are shown . gfp-cpna was found associated with the membrane of the phagosome, surrounding the phagocytosed yeast cell. discussion copines make up a family of soluble, calcium-dependent membrane binding proteins found in a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms. copines are characterized as having two c <dig> domains at the n-terminal region followed by an \"a domain,\" similar to the von willebrand a domain found in integrins, in the c-terminal region <cit> . copines appear to be absent from the sacchromyces cerevisae genome, while the genomes of paramecium, arabidopsis, c. elegans, and human have two, three, five, and nine, respectively <cit> . tomsig and creutz <cit> have hypothesized that copines play a role in calcium signaling by binding to target proteins with their a domains and then bringing those target proteins to a particular membrane through the action of their c <dig> domains in response to a rise in calcium concentration. because copines have two c <dig> domains, they have also been hypothesized to have a role in membrane trafficking. it is possible that both ideas could be correct; copines may provide links between signaling pathways and membrane trafficking pathways. here, we have described the identification of six copine genes in dictyostelium and the initial characterization of one copine gene, cpna. cpna is unique among the dictyostelium copines in that it contains a c-terminal tail domain following the a domain that is ~ <dig> amino acids longer . moreover, the c-terminal tail domain of cpna does not exhibit sequence similarity to copines found in any organisms. western blot analysis indicates that cpna is present throughout the 24-hour development with only slight differences in protein levels . however, any rapid changes in protein levels that may occur between the 5-hour time spans used in our experiment would not be detected. in in vitro binding assays, cpna pellets with membranes in the presence of calcium. however, a small fraction of cpna also pellets with membranes in the presence of egta, indicating that although most cpna binds to membranes in a calcium-dependent manner, some may bind independently of calcium. this small amount of calcium-independent binding was also seen with the arabidopsis copine protein <cit> and a neurally expressed mouse copine, n-copine <cit> . gfp-tagged copines have been expressed in both arabidopsis <cit> and c. elegans <cit> . in arabidopsis, cpn1-gfp localizes to the plasma membrane. in c. elegans, gem-4::gfp also localizes to the plasma membrane; however, punctate staining of the cytoplasm is also observed. in vegetative dictyostelium cells, a gfp-tagged version of cpna was observed throughout the cytoplasm without any detectable association with membranes. this could perhaps be due to the fact that the gfp-cpna is markedly overexpressed and the soluble gfp-cpna filling the cytoplasm is masking any membrane association. however, we think this is unlikely, given that cells expressing gfp-cpna display variable expression levels and imaging very low expressing cells did not reveal any membrane association. alternatively, gfp-cpna may only localize to membranes in response to a rise in the cytosolic calcium concentration. when imaging a large field of starved cells, we noticed a few cells that displayed a very transient membrane localization of gfp-cpna. in addition, the transient localization of gfp-cpna often occurred multiple times within the same cell. our observations that gfp-cpna binds to membranes in a calcium-dependent manner in vitro and the rapid oscillatory nature of the translocation of gfp-cpna from cytosol to membranes and back to the cytosol suggests that gfp-cpna is responding to fast intracellular calcium spikes or waves. it is known that starved cells undergo oscillatory responses to waves of camp accompanied by a transient rise in calcium during the aggregation stage of development. however, these oscillations have a period of 6– <dig> minutes, while the gfp-cpna membrane localization oscillations we have observed exhibit a period on the order of seconds or tens of seconds. on the other hand, fast oscillatory calcium spikes lasting for <dig> to <dig> seconds with a period of 1– <dig> minutes have been reported to occur specifically in regions containing prestalk cells in multicellular stages of dictyostelium <cit> . during differentiation, stalk cells vacuolate, synthesize a cellulose cell wall, and eventually undergo programmed cell death to form the thin stalk of the mature fruiting body <cit> . many lines of evidence indicate that calcium is involved in the differentiation of stalk cells <cit> . pre-stalk cells have been shown to possess higher levels of free calcium <cit> . moreover, vegetative cells that are newly starved fall into high and low sequestered calcium classes and those that possess higher levels of calcium tend to enter the prestalk regions of the slugs <cit> . it has also been shown that increasing calcium levels increases the stalk cell to spore cell ratio <cit> . the differentiation inducing factor, dif, which induces the transcription of prestalk genes, has been shown to mediate its effects by causing a slow sustained increase in intracellular calcium levels <cit> . we speculate that the observed oscillations of membrane localization of gfp-cpna may be occurring in only pre-stalk cells that are accumulating higher levels of calcium. the higher concentrations of calcium in pre-stalk cells could produce oscillatory calcium spikes in an early pre-aggregative stage of development. if fast calcium waves are mediating the translocation of gfp-cpna from cytosol to membranes as we have suggested, an important question that remains is what is triggering the calcium waves in these cells. the fact that global treatment of starved cells with camp does not induce gfp-cpna membrane localization suggests that the trigger is not camp. the observed gfp-cpna membrane oscillations could be triggered by other signaling molecules secreted by starved cells. alternatively, the presumed calcium oscillations may be part of a stress response due to the strong illumination of the laser; some of the cells exhibiting these oscillations showed signs of blebbing caused by the laser. in addition to transiently associating with the plasma membrane, gfp-cpna was also seen to associate with intracellular vacuoles in vivo. a similar pattern was seen in fixed cells ; this may be caused by the release of calcium from intracellular stores during the fixation process. using fixed cells, we were able to identify the gfp-cpna labeled vacuoles as contractile vacuoles, organelles of the endolyosomal pathway, and phagosomes . the association of gfp-cpna with intracellular vacuoles suggest that cpna may have a role in the function of these organelles and/or the trafficking between these organelles and the plasma membrane. several multiple c <dig> domain-containing proteins have been implicated in membrane trafficking, particularly exocytosis <cit> . in addition, it has been shown that in neutrophils fast calcium waves accompany phagocytosis <cit> . CONCLUSIONS our results indicate that dictyostelium has multiple copine homologs and provides a good system in which to study copine function. cpna is present in vegetative cells and throughout development suggesting it may function in all stages of development. in vitro assays show that cpna is a calcium-dependent membrane binding protein. a gfp-tagged cpna also binds to membranes in a calcium-dependent manner in vitro. gfp-cpna translocates from the cytosol to specific membranes and back to the cytosol very rapidly in only a subset of starved cells in vivo. these membranes include the plasma membrane and intracellular vacuoles. studies with fixed cells suggest these intracellular vacuoloes include contractile vacuoles, organelles of the endolysosomal pathway, and phagosomes. the association of gfp-cpna with intracellular vacuoles suggest that cpna may have a role in the function of these organelles. in addition, we speculate that the transient membrane localization of cpna is caused by fast calcium spikes found only in cells destined to become stalk cells and hypothesize that cpna may have a role in the differentiation of stalk cells. we have recently created a cpna- knockout mutant strain in dictyostelium and characterization of the cpna-mutants will allow us to test these hypotheses about the function of cpna.",

    "prompt": "Capture the essential diagnostic criteria in a short summary. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of few yeast species capable of growing under strict anaerobic conditions <cit> . this trait together with a high tolerance toward inhibitory compounds, e.g. ethanol, weak acids, phenolics and furaldehydes, has made s. cerevisiae the organism of choice for bioethanol production <cit> . the development of sustainable processes for biofuel production is an important step in the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and becoming independent of fossil fuels <cit> . the utilization of lignocellulosic raw material for the production of fuel-grade ethanol is one such process currently under development <cit> . these raw materials are generated as waste in e.g. agricultural and forestry industries and contain a large fraction of fermentable sugars. the composition of the sugar fraction varies between different materials, but the largest part often consists of glucose and xylose <cit> . efficient utilization of both these sugars is necessary for the ethanol production process to be economically feasible <cit> . s. cerevisiae is well-known for its capability to ferment hexoses, especially glucose. however, s. cerevisiae cannot naturally utilize xylose and thus has to be genetically modified. the simultaneous expression of the xyl <dig> and xyl <dig> genes from scheffersomyces stipitis encoding xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase , respectively, is one pathway that enables xylose utilization by s. cerevisiae <cit> . although many advances have been made in the development of xylose-fermenting s. cerevisiae strains, the efficiency is still far from matching that of glucose <cit> . the ability of s. cerevisiae to grow under strict anaerobic conditions is dependent on the activity of fumarate reductase enzymes <cit> . s. cerevisiae has two genes, frd <dig> and osm <dig> encoding the cytosolic and mitochondrial fr enzymes, respectively <cit> . these enzymes catalyse the reduction of fumarate to succinate while regenerating fad from fadh <dig> <cit> . this is the last step of the reductive branch of the tca-cycle where mitochondrial nad is regenerated under anaerobic conditions <cit> . single deletion of frd <dig> or osm <dig> has no effect on the ability to grow under anaerobiosis, but a double deletion mutant cannot grow under such conditions unless an external electron acceptor is supplied <cit> . it has thus been proposed that fr enzymes provide the only way for yeast to regenerate the fad/fmn prosthetic group of flavin enzymes that are required for growth under anoxia <cit> . ero1p is one such essential flavin-containing oxidase, which normally uses oxygen as a final electron acceptor for fad regeneration. ero1p is a thiol oxidase <cit> that operates together with pdi1p <cit> in the endoplasmic reticulum where they take part in the maturation of secretory proteins <cit> . both proteins are essential for the formation of disulphide bonds and together they form a classical proteinaceous electron relay system in which electrons are passed from the substrate polypeptide, via pdi1p and the membrane-bound ero1p, to eventually react with oxygen <cit> . approximately one third of the yeast proteome is processed in the secretory pathway which makes this mechanism indispensable for cell viability, growth and function <cit> . many of the maturation processes taking place in the er are regulated by a mechanism referred to as the unfolded protein response under conditions of stress or increased folding requirements <cit> . the er contains a transmembrane protein encoded by ire <dig> which has a cytosolic ribonuclease domain and a luminal sensor domain. the sensor detects rising levels of unfolded proteins inside the er and activates the cytosolic domain. this activity removes an intron from hac <dig> pre-mrna and the fragments formed are ligated by trl1p ligase to form mature hac <dig> mrna. hac1p is a potent transcriptional activator of upr target genes which include both pdi <dig> and ero <dig> and dozens of genes related to translocation, glycosylation, folding and degradation <cit> . thus, the upr balances the biosynthetic rate of secretory proteins and fine tunes the er capacity to meet cellular demands. previous transcription analyses of recombinant xylose-fermenting strains have mainly focused on the changes that occur in genes encoding enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism <cit> . very little attention has been given to other fundamental cellular processes such as the folding of proteins. recently we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic changes in intracellular metabolites that occur during batch fermentation of a glucose/xylose mixture using a recombinant xr/xdh-strain <cit> . in that study we observed a marked accumulation of intracellular malate and fumarate during xylose fermentation. the direct connection between fumarate metabolism and protein folding under anaerobic conditions prompted us to further investigate this system during xylose fermentation. due to the essential role of fr enzymes in anaerobic growth we hypothesized that the activity of fr is reduced on xylose which in turn would affect the capacity to regenerate the fad required for proper folding of proteins in the er. such an impairment of the protein folding process could be the underlying cause for the slow anaerobic growth on xylose. in this study we examined this hypothesis by over-expressing the two genes encoding fr, alone and in combination with ero <dig> and evaluated the effect on fermentation performance in two different media containing glucose and xylose. methods strains and culture conditions plasmids and yeast strains used in the study are listed in table <dig> yeast strains were recovered from 20% glycerol stocks stored at −80°c on solid ypd plates for two days at 30°c. yeast cultures were grown in liquid ypd medium for 14–16 h, or less when required, at 30°c and 180 rpm in an orbital shaker. transformants were selected on solid yeast nitrogen base medium with 20 g/l glucose as carbon source. leucine was supplemented when required at 220 mg/l. cultivations in shake flasks had a culture volume of 10% or less of the flask volume. the defined

contained 10 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/l glucose, 50 g/l xylose, 50 mm potassium hydrogen phthalate buffer at ph <dig> , 10 g/l 2so <dig> 1 g/l mgso <dig> and 6 g/l kh2po <dig> all media used in anaerobic cultivations were supplemented with tween <dig> and ergosterol . e. coli strain neb5α was used for sub-cloning of plasmid dna. transformants were selected on solid lb plates , supplemented with 100 mg/l of ampicillin, for 16 h at 37°c. cultures of transformed e. coli were recovered from 25% glycerol stocks stored at −80°c and grown in liquid lb medium, supplemented with ampicillin, for 14–16 h at 37°c and 180 rpm in an orbital shaker. cloning procedures standard molecular biology techniques were used for all cloning procedures <cit> . plasmid purification was performed using genejet plasmid mini-prep kit . dna fragments digested with restriction enzymes were excised from agarose gel and purified using qiaquick gel extraction kit when needed. dna fragments amplified by pcr were purified using genejet pcr purification kit . all enzymes for pcr amplifications, ligations and restriction digestions were obtained from thermo scientific unless stated otherwise. pcr products were amplified using the high fidelity phusion hotstart ii polymerase or high fidelity taq polymerase mix . competent yeast cells were prepared and transformed according to the peg/liac method <cit> and heat shock competent e. coli cells were prepared according to the inoue method <cit> and transformed according to the supplier’s instructions. the gene frd <dig> was amplified from yeast genomic dna by pcr using primers frd1-f1-spei and frd1-r1-sali . the gene osm <dig> was amplified from yeast genomic dna by pcr using primers osm1-f1-spei and osm1-r1-sali . the amplified frd <dig> and osm <dig> genes were digested with spei and sali and inserted between the tdh <dig> promoter and cyc <dig> terminator of the previously constructed vector yipdr <dig> yielding the two plasmids yipbb <dig> and yipbb <dig> . the cloned genes were verified by dna sequencing. the ero <dig> gene, including a 300 bp downstream sequence, was amplified from yeast genomic dna by pcr using primers ero1-f1-bamhi and ero1-r1-xhoi . the amplified ero <dig> orf and terminator was digested with bamhi and xhoi and inserted between the tef <dig> promoter and cyc <dig> terminator of the vector p426tef . the tef1p-ero1-ero1t cassette was amplified from plasmid p426tef-ero <dig> using primers p426tef-f1-saci and p426ero1t-r1-ndei . the amplified cassette was digested with bamhi and xhoi and ligated into plasmids yipbb <dig> and yipbb <dig> digested with the same enzymes, yielding vectors yipbb <dig> and yipbb <dig> respectively . the cloned cassette was verified by dna sequencing. strain construction s. cerevisiae strain tmb <dig> was constructed by transforming strain tmb <dig> with yipdr <dig> linearized with ecorv. the integrative plasmids yipbb1- <dig> were linearized with ecorv, aflii, eco91i and aflii, respectively, and used to transform strain tmb <dig> yielding strains tmb <dig> , tmb <dig> , tmb <dig> and tmb <dig> . the control strain tmb <dig> was constructed by transforming tmb <dig> with yiplac <dig> linearized with ecorv. correct integration of the vectors was verified by pcr using primer pairs that annealed on the plasmid and on the chromosome outside the homologous regions of ura <dig> or leu <dig> loci. the functionality of the over-expressed frd <dig> and osm <dig> genes was verified by measuring the specific fumarate reductase activity in cell-free protein extracts from strains tmb3455- <dig> grown anaerobically on xylose. strains tmb3456- <dig> had between 9- and 30-fold higher activities than the control showing that the over-expressed genes generated increased levels of functional enzymes . the functionality of the over-expressed ero <dig> gene was verified by determining the sensitivity toward dtt. single colonies of strains tmb3455- <dig> were inoculated in 5 ml ynb medium with 2% glucose and grown over-night. 200 μl of this culture was used to inoculate fresh medium and cultivated until the cells reached od <dig> nm ≈ <dig> a volume containing 2 × <dig> cells was spread on solid ypd medium after which a filter disc was placed in the centre of the plate and soaked with 20 μl or 30 μl of 1 m dtt solution. the plates were incubated 48 h at 30°c before measuring the diameter of the halo formed around the disc. the halos formed with strains tmb <dig> and tmb <dig> were 20-30% smaller compared with the other strains showing that the over-expressed ero <dig> gene generated increased level of a functional enzyme . anaerobic batch fermentations yeast strains were pre-grown in ynb medium with 2% glucose until mid-exponential phase and inoculated into 50 ml medium with 2% glucose and 5% xylose in 250 ml crimp-sealed serum flasks at a concentration of <dig> g cdw/l. prior to inoculation the headspace was flushed with n2-gas containing less than 5 ppm oxygen for at least 30 min to ensure anaerobic conditions. cultivations were carried out in a 30°c water bath with continuous stirring at 180 rpm using magnetic stirrers. to prevent diffusion of oxygen into the culture during sampling, the excess gas was released through a <dig> μm filter connected to norprene tubing submerged under water. cell dry weight was calculated from od measurements using a pre-determined relationship between od and cell dry weight. fermentation experiments were performed in biological duplicates. preparation of cell-free protein extracts yeast strains were cultivated anaerobically in crimp-sealed serum flasks as described above using 2x ynb medium with 2% glucose and 5% xylose. after 36 h, when xylose was the only carbon source, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm and 4°c for 10 min. the resulting cell pellets were resuspended in 1x lysis buffer to obtain a final suspension of 1 g wet cells/ml. protein extracts were prepared using a precellys® <dig> homogenizer with cooling provided by the cryolys® unit and precellys lysing kit vk <dig> containing <dig> mm glass beads. the unit was operated for 3 × 45 s at 5000 rpm with 30 s pauses between each cycle and at max 8°c. cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at <dig> × g and 4°c for 15 min and the supernatant was transferred to a small glass vial. before sealing the vial the headspace was replaced with n2-gas in an anaerobic chamber. the protein extracts were stored at 4°c until the following day. protein concentrations were determined with the coomassie protein assay reagent using bsa as standard . fumarate reductase activity assay fumarate reductase activity was determined in a <dig> ml reaction mixture containing: 50 mm k,na-po <dig> buffer , 10 mm fumaric acid , <dig> mm fmn-na, 2% sodium hydrosulfite. all reagents, except protein extract, were added to a rubber-sealed cuvette inside an anaerobic chamber. the assay buffer was prepared by dissolving <dig> g of kh2po <dig> and <dig> g of na2hpo4·2h2o in 50 ml anaerobic water inside the anaerobic chamber, creating one 10x solution and one 2x solution, respectively. a 200 mm stock solution at the correct ph was made by mixing 5 ml 10x with 25 ml 2x and completing the volume to 50 ml with anaerobic water. a 40 mm stock solution of fumaric acid was prepared by dissolving <dig> g fumaric acid in 50 ml of 5 mm k,na-po <dig> buffer at ph <dig> . the ph was adjusted to <dig> using 5 m naoh and the volume was completed to 100 ml with water. solutions of the cofactor and reducing agent were prepared fresh before each assay. both compounds were weighed and brought into the anaerobic chamber. the fmn cofactor was dissolved in anaerobic water and sodium hydrosulfite was dissolved in 100 mm k,na-po <dig> buffer, but only after all other reagents had been added to the cuvette to ensure that fmn becomes completely reduced to fmnh <dig> the reaction was started by addition of protein extract using a gas-tight syringe. the formation of fmn was measured at 445 nm in cuvettes with light path length of 1 cm using an ultrospec <dig> pro spectrophotometer controlled by computer software swift reaction kinetics v. <dig> . the absorbance was converted to concentration units using the molar extinction coefficient of fmn . the slope was determined within an interval of at least 1 min, using at least three different dilutions of the protein extract. only the slopes within the range <dig> - <dig> a/min were considered acceptable. one unit is defined as the conversion of 1 μmol of fumarate per minute. biomass determination and analysis of metabolites optical density was measured at 620 nm using an ultrospec <dig> pro spectrophotometer . cell dry weight was measured in triplicate by filtering a known volume of the culture through a pre-weighed nitrocellulose filter with <dig> μm pore size. the filters were washed with three volumes of water, dried in a microwave oven and weighed after equilibrating to room temperature in a desiccator. concentrations of glucose, xylose, xylitol, glycerol, succinate, acetate and ethanol were analysed by hplc . aminex hpx-87h ion exchange column was used at 45°c with a mobile phase of 5 mm h2so <dig> at a flow rate of <dig> ml/min. all compounds were detected with a rid-10a refractive index detector . calculation of metabolic rates in defined medium the volumetric production and consumption rates , the maximum specific consumption rates of xylose and glucose , as well as the biomass yield per consumed substrate were calculated through linear regression according to equations 1– <dig> the product yields per consumed substrate were calculated using the determined volumetric rates according to equation <dig> the product yields per biomass were calculated as the ratio between yi/s and yx/s when xylose was the carbon source and according to equation <dig> when glucose was the carbon source. due to the non-exponential growth on xylose, the maximum specific growth rate was calculated as the product between rxyl and yx/s according to equation <dig> for comparative reasons μmax on glucose was calculated in the same way. these values corresponded well with those calculated through regression of ln vs. time. the specific production rates were calculated as the product between μmax and yi/x according to equation <dig> qi=dcidt,qs=dcsdt rxyl=dcxyl/cxdt rglc=ddcglc/dtdcx yx/s=dcxdcs,tot yi/s=qiqs yi/x=dcidcx μmax=rs·yx/s ri=μmax·yi/x in complex medium all calculations were made as described above except for the maximum specific consumption rate of glucose which could not be determined accurately enough. hence, the μmax under these conditions was determined as the slope in a linear regression of ln vs. time and rglc was calculated using equation <dig> the significance of a difference between two mean values was calculated using a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance of the two samples with two degrees of freedom unless stated otherwise. balances of carbon and degree of reduction, determined for the glucose and xylose phases using calculated yield coefficients, are given as supplementary information in additional file 2: table s <dig> transcriptional analysis of upr related genes the list of genes reported as targets of the upr were taken from <cit> . transcript data from cultivations of a xr/xdh-strain using glucose or xylose in aerobic and anaerobic conditions was taken from <cit> . upr target genes that had a significant change in expression during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions with xylose as carbon source were included in the analysis. two genes commonly used as targets of the upr <cit> did not pass the statistical requirement and were thus not included in the analysis . hierarchical clustering was performed using the clustergram function in matlab r2010b with log <dig> values of transcriptional changes. euclidean distance was used to calculate the distance between the data points and average linkage was used to generate the dendrogram. data used for the hierarchical clustering is given as supplementary information in additional file 2: table s <dig> RESULTS genes targeted by the unfolded protein response are differentially expressed on xylose compared to glucose a previously performed transcripome study in a recombinant xr/xdh-strain <cit> was used to investigate the expression level of genes associated with the upr. it revealed that ire <dig> and hac <dig> levels were ~65% and ~50% higher in cells growing anaerobically on xylose compared to cells growing aerobically . however, the transcript level of trl <dig> encoding the ligase, was ~50% lower , suggesting that hac <dig> is mainly present as fragments rather than mature mrna molecules. the transcript levels of these genes did not change significantly during the same transition on glucose indicating that the response was associated with the type of carbon source available. the cluster analysis illustrated in figure <dig> indeed shows that a majority of the included upr target genes were down-regulated on xylose when the conditions changed from aerobic to anaerobic . the genes belonging to this group represent functions taking place in all steps of the maturation process and do not change during the same transition on glucose. the smallest group contained those genes which are regulated equally on glucose and xylose, with only small differences in abundance between the two carbon sources. a small number of genes were up-regulated on xylose while remaining largely unchanged on glucose . these genes are related to peroxisome biogenesis , ubiquitin recycling and the cell integrity signalling pathway . the three genes ecm <dig> ecm <dig> and yet <dig> encode proteins with unknown functions. rib <dig> encodes gtp cyclohydrolase ii which catalyses the first step of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway. the fourth group contains genes which are strongly up-regulated in response to anaerobiosis in both conditions . however, in contrast to the genes in group b, the transcript levels of these genes were in general lower on xylose compared to glucose. this analysis shows that the upr responded differently to xylose compared to glucose. furthermore, the repression of a majority of the target genes suggests that the capacity of the secretory pathway could be limited during xylose fermentation. consistent with previously reported expression patterns on non-fermentable carbon sources and entry into stationary phase <cit> , the expression of ero <dig> was reduced by ~30% on xylose compared to glucose, both under anaerobic and aerobic conditions <cit> . hence, a reduced capacity to form disulphide bonds in nascent polypeptides translocated to the er could be one underlying cause for the low anaerobic growth rate on xylose. the previously reported accumulation of intracellular fumarate during xylose fermentation <cit> suggested that recombinant xr/xdh strains have a limited fr activity under such conditions, which would lead to insufficient recycling of the fad co-factor required by ero1p. this hypothesis was investigated by evaluating the physiological effect of over-expressing the cytosolic and mitochondrial fr enzymes, alone and in combination with ero <dig> during fermentation of a mixture of glucose and xylose. over-expression of cytosolic fr has limited impact on xylose fermentation due to the higher contribution of the cytosolic fr to the total cellular reductase activity the over-expression of frd <dig> alone and in combination with ero <dig> was evaluated first. when cultivated in defined medium with 20 g/l glucose and 50 g/l xylose, tmb <dig> and tmb <dig> consumed the glucose within 20 h and ca. 70% of the xylose within 90 h . the two strains behaved very similar to the control strain and no significant physiological differences from this strain were observed . these results suggest that the implemented genetic modifications had no positive effect on the anaerobic growth on xylose in defined medium. however, the modifications only ensured that the genes required for regeneration of fad co-factors were present . if substrates are not available in sufficient amounts these modifications are not effective in regenerating the co-factor. the poor repressive capability of xylose leads to an up-regulation of mdh <dig> <cit> , encoding cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, which has previously been suggested as an unbeneficial reaction that directs carbon away from amino acid synthesis by converting oxaloacetate into malate <cit> . a reduced synthesis of amino acids could thus hamper the formation of polypeptides and mask the effect of the genetic modifications. to investigate whether the strains were limited by amino acid synthesis they were cultivated in a complex medium containing yeast extract. changing from a defined medium to a complex medium led to several significant changes in the physiology of all strains, e.g. increased maximum growth rate, increased biomass yield and reduced by-product yields . hence, the glucose was consumed within 15 h and ca. 80% of the xylose was consumed within 65 h . however, despite the increased nutrient availability no significant differences were observed between the control strain and the frd1-overexpressing strains tmb <dig> and tmb <dig> . over-expression of mitochondrial fr has a detrimental effect on xylose fermentation although the change from a defined medium to a complex medium led to a general increase in the growth rate on xylose, the over-expression of frd <dig> alone or in combination with ero <dig> had little effect on the cellular physiology. one explanation could be that the previously observed accumulation of fumarate <cit> does not occur in the cytosol, but is restricted to the mitochondria. to investigate this possibility we over-expressed the osm <dig> gene, alone and in combination with ero <dig> and evaluated the fermentation performance in both defined and complex media with 20 g/l glucose and 50 g/l xylose. in defined medium, tmb <dig> and tmb <dig> also consumed the glucose within 20 h and ca. 60% of the xylose within 90 h . during glucose fermentation these strains behaved similar to the other strains and gave nearly the same product yields as the control strain . when xylose became the sole carbon source the physiology changed drastically and the two strains behaved differently. the maximum growth rate of strain tmb <dig> was 47% lower compared with the control strain and the biomass-specific yields of acetate and ethanol increased by 130% and 69% , respectively . as a result a smaller fraction of the carbon was distributed to biomass and glycerol in favour of acetate and ethanol . strain tmb <dig> did not display any difference in growth rate on xylose compared with the control strain . the acetate yield per biomass also increased by 44% whereas the glycerol and xylitol yields decreased by 39% and 20% compared with the control strain . hence, this strain diverted the carbon away from glycerol, xylitol and ethanol for a higher yield of acetate and maintained biomass yield . y xylt/s y glyc/s y ac/s y etoh/s y succ/s y xylt/x y glyc/x y ac/x y etoh/x y succ/x values are given as mean ± standard deviation of two independent experiments. data for strains tmb <dig> and tmb <dig> is reported in additional file 2: table s <dig> in complex medium strains tmb <dig> and tmb <dig> consumed glucose within 15 h but only 50-60% of xylose was consumed within 65 h . the performance of the strains did not differ significantly from the control strain during the glucose phase . with xylose as the carbon source, on the other hand, both strains grew markedly slower than the control strain. the growth rates of tmb <dig> and tmb <dig> on xylose were reduced by 25% and 51% , respectively . both strains also increased the biomass-specific yield of acetate by 73% and 157% , respectively . although both strains diverted more carbon toward acetate, different by-product yields were reduced by each strain. tmb <dig> gave a reduced substrate-specific yield of glycerol by 31% whereas tmb <dig> gave reduced yields of ethanol and biomass by 21% and 34% , respectively . y xylt/s y glyc/s y ac/s y etoh/s y succ/s y xylt/x y glyc/x y ac/x y etoh/x y succcxxx values are given as mean ± standard deviation of two independent experiments. data for strains tmb <dig> and tmb <dig> is reported in additional file 2: table s <dig> these results indicate that the reactions taking place in the mitochondria have a significant role in xylose metabolism and that they are more sensitive to changes in metabolite levels on xylose compared to glucose. hence, the over-expression of osm <dig> caused physiological responses that were not observed in strains over-expressing frd <dig> in strain tmb <dig> these responses were: i) a 20-40% reduction in glycerol yield, ii) a 63-68% increase in acetate yield and iii) a 27-38% reduction in growth rate during xylose fermentation . a possible explanation for this phenotype could be that osm1p interacts with gut2p and ach1p which are both located specifically inside the mitochondria . gut <dig> encodes a fad-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase located in the mitochondrial inner membrane <cit> and expression of the gene is repressed in the presence of glucose and induced during growth on non-fermentable carbon sources <cit> . an induction of the gut <dig> gene has also been shown to occur during xylose fermentation with transcript levels more than 7-fold higher compared to glucose <cit> . recently, the protein encoded by ach <dig> was shown to function as a coenzyme a transferase rather than an acetyl-coa hydrolase <cit> . hence, this enzyme catalyses the following reaction: acetyl-coa + succinate → succinyl-coa + acetate and is also induced nearly 5-fold during xylose fermentation compared to glucose <cit> . if both gut2p and ach1p are active on xylose, the pathway formed together with osm1p could explain the diversion of carbon from glycerol to acetate as well as the reduced growth rate due to a reduced acetyl-coa availability . however, this hypothesis needs to be validated through further investigations. frd1p and osm1p do not influence regeneration of cytosolic nad an early study on the role of fr showed that the addition of oxidised methylene blue or phenazine methosulfate, which chemically oxidises nadh to nad, to cultures of a frd1Δ osm1Δ double mutant rescued the non-growing phenotype under anaerobic conditions <cit> . it was thus proposed that the two fr enzymes are involved in the oxidation of excess nadh formed in the cytosol and the mitochondria under anaerobic conditions. the formation of xylitol during xylose fermentation has been ascribed to an inability of the cells to regenerate the nad needed for the conversion of xylitol to xylulose by xdh <cit> . the addition of acetoin, a substrate which can be reduced by yeast to <dig> -butanediol using nadh, to cultures fermenting xylose reduces the xylitol yield significantly <cit> . if the fr enzymes participate in the conversion of excess nadh a reduction of the xylitol yield during xylose fermentation would be expected when the fr activity is increased. however, the over-expression of frd <dig> or osm <dig> did not affect the amount of xylitol produced from xylose . this is in agreement with other studies showing that addition of acetoin to a culture of a frd1Δ osm1Δ double mutant does not rescue the non-growing phenotype under anaerobic conditions <cit> . in addition, the proposed mechanism of nadh oxidation requires the presence of an enzyme capable of transferring electrons from nadh to fad to generate the reduced cofactor used as substrate by fumarate reductase <cit> . as of yet, no such enzyme has been identified in s. cerevisiae that is expressed under anaerobic conditions. there are, however, fr enzymes that use nadh as co-factor instead of fadh <dig> the nadh-dependent fr enzyme from trypanosoma brucei has recently been expressed in a xylose-utilizing s. cerevisiae strain which resulted in increased ethanol yield and decreased xylitol yield when fermenting xylose <cit> . based on these results we conclude that the fr enzymes from s. cerevisiae do not influence the regeneration of cytosolic nad. other potential limitations in the secretory pathway in s. cerevisiae during xylose fermentation the results obtained in this study indicate that the activities of fr and ero1p enzymes are not limiting during xylose fermentation. measurements of the fr activity in strain tmb <dig> when growing on glucose and when metabolizing xylose indeed showed equal activities around 3 mu/mg protein in both conditions . this is contradicting previous studies showing that the activity and expression of frd <dig> and osm <dig> decrease upon entry into stationary phase <cit> and during carbon starvation <cit> . it is, however, possible that the fr activity is maintained high on xylose in response to cellular stress. the up-stream regions of the frd <dig> and osm <dig> genes contain binding sites for stress-related transcription factors yap1p and, in the case of frd <dig> msn2p/msn4p <cit> . due to the involvement of yap1p, an oxidative stress would be most likely in this case <cit> . this possibility is supported by much higher intracellular concentrations of both reduced and oxidized glutathione <cit> and higher transcript levels of msn <dig> and yap <dig> <cit> in recombinant s. cerevisiae strains during xylose fermentation compared to glucose fermentation . the up-regulation of rib <dig> could be an indication that the need for flavin-containing complexes and/or the free co-factor is increased on xylose. ero1p has been shown to use free fad as electron acceptor in vitro under anaerobic conditions <cit> which is in line with the ability of the fr enzymes to use free fadh <dig> as cofactor and their essential nature under such conditions. as s. cerevisiae possesses one gene encoding a mitochondrial fad transporter <cit> and three genes encoding putative transporters associated with the er <cit> , fad-exchange between compartments should indeed be possible. this highlights free fad as a potentially crucial metabolite for sustaining anaerobic growth. pdi1p is, together with ero1p, essential for disulphide bond formation in the er <cit> . although transcriptional analysis did not show any difference in expression of pdi <dig> between glucose and xylose fermentation <cit> , proteome analysis of a mutant strain with improved xylose-fermenting capability identified pdi1p as significantly more abundant in the improved strain compared with the wild-type <cit> . this strongly indicates that there indeed is a need for a higher capacity in the protein folding mechanism for efficient xylose fermentation. whether this capacity is for regulation of disulphide bond formation <cit> , reduction of non-native disulphide bonds <cit> or targeting unfolded glycoproteins for degradation <cit> remains to be investigated. CONCLUSIONS over-expression of frd <dig> encoding the cytosolic fr, did not improve the growth rate on xylose, even when the strain was provided with all amino acids and an additional copy of the ero <dig> gene controlled by a strong promoter. over-expression of the osm <dig> gene, encoding the mitochondrial fr, even had a detrimental effect and caused a reduced growth rate. hence, we conclude that increasing the activities of the fr enzymes and ero1p is not sufficient to increase the anaerobic growth on xylose. however, our transcription analysis of upr related genes showed a wide down-regulation of the secretory pathway during xylose fermentation indicating that additional components of the protein folding mechanism may be limited. two immediate factors should notably be investigated further: i) the actual form of hac <dig> inside the cells during xylose fermentation to determine the regulatory component and ii) the activity of pdi1p which is acting together with ero1p in the formation of disulphide bridges. furthermore, understanding the requirement of free fad for anaerobic growth could prove to be essential for the development of efficient xylose-utilizing s. cerevisiae strains. abbreviations ac: acetate; acald: acetaldehyde; accoa: acetyl-coa; akg: alpha-ketoglutarate; coa: coenzyme a; cit: citrate; er: endoplasmic reticulum; etoh: ethanol; fr: fumarate reductase; fum: fumarate; icit: isocitrate; mal: l-malate; oaa: oxaloacetate; pyr: pyruvate; succ: succinate; succoa: succinyl-coa; upr: unfolded protein response; xdh: xylitol dehydrogenase; xr: xylose reductase. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors’ contribution the study was conceived by bb who designed the experiments and supervised the master student who performed most of the molecular biology work. the enzymatic assay was developed by bb who also performed the fermentation experiments, analysed the data and wrote the manuscript. bb, mgg and evn have discussed the results and implications throughout the work. mgg and evn have commented on the manuscript at all stages. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. supplementary material additional file 1 supplementary figures s1-s <dig> description: fr activity measurements, dtt sensitivity results, fermentation profiles. click here for file additional file 2 supplementary tables s1-s <dig> description: genes included in the cluster analysis, maximum specific growth rates and product yields using strains tmb <dig> tmb <dig> and tmb <dig> click here for file acknowledgements we wish to acknowledge mégane cléret for her work in the initial characterization of strain tmb <dig> and tarinee boonyawan for the amplification and cloning of the osm <dig> and ero <dig> genes. the swedish national energy agency is gratefully acknowledged for financial support.",

    "prompt": "Write a brief summary of the study design and endpoints. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND knowledge about microbial communities and the factors governing microbial community composition is fundamental for our understanding of ecology, but also for biotechnological applications such as wastewater treatment <cit> . since isolation and cultivation is usually only successful for a fraction of the bacterial species present in an environmental sample , dna-based methods are routinely used to describe microbial communities. dna fingerprinting, gene sequencing, and in recent years, next-generation sequencing technologies enables descriptions of microbial communities at different resolution, where the latter provides an unprecedented level of detail. although fingerprinting methods, such as terminal restriction fragment polymorphism , are trumped by next-generation sequencing technologies when it comes to describing the depth of microbial communities, numerous studies comparing the two methods have shown that the same conclusions can be drawn from both approaches, both with regard to community structure <cit> and dynamics <cit> of the community. it can also be argued that the advantage of traditional fingerprinting techniques is the ability to analyze a high number of samples at a low cost <cit> , thus ensuring proper replication and statistical power. in conclusion, despite the continuously decreasing cost and the popularity of next-generation sequencing, fingerprinting techniques such as t-rflp are still relevant and an important tool for studies of microbial communities. in a t-rflp analysis, the gene of interest, typically the 16s rrna gene, is amplified by pcr where one or both of the primers are labeled with a fluorescent marker. the gene is then digested by a restriction enzyme and the restriction fragments are separated by polyacrylamide or capillary gel electrophoresis. the terminal restriction fragments are detected by an automated dna sequencer and the lengths of the t-rfs are estimated. the resulting t-rflp fingerprint of a community is a set of t-rfs, referred to as a t-rf profile. the length of a t-rf depends on the position of the restriction enzyme recognition sites and different t-rf lengths therefore represent different gene sequences. differences in microbial community composition between samples are assessed by comparing the presence and relative abundances of t-rfs in the t-rf profiles. to be able to accurately interpret differences in t-rf profiles as differences in community composition it is important to know the variability of the method and how effective different analysis methods are in reducing variations and maintaining reproducibility. an important part of the analysis is to distinguish true t-rfs from false t-rfs derived from noise peaks or artifacts. one way to do this is by the application of a peak detection threshold , either when the peaks are detected and t-rf sizes are estimated, or afterwards, on the already generated data. in the literature, the range of applied pdts varies from low <cit> , accepting most detected t-rfs, to high <cit> , only considering peaks with a high fluorescence intensity. this range may be due to differences in the obtained fluorescence intensity of the peaks and background noise levels between different analytical platforms. in this study t-rflp analyses were carried out using the <dig> dna analyzer with a typical baseline noise level between <dig> and <dig> fluorescence units. here we evaluate the effect of applying an intermediate or high pdt on the characteristics of the t-rf profiles and on the subsequent comparisons of t-rf profiles. other important steps in the analysis of t-rflp data which affects the reproducibility is the alignment of t-rfs and the normalization of t-rf profiles, both of which we evaluate here. alignment of t-rfs is the process by which it is determined which t-rfs that are the same in two or more samples. this may seem straightforward but due to the large variation in the estimated sizes of the t-rfs it can be both time-consuming and difficult to do in an accurate way, in particular when analyzing large datasets with high number of t-rfs. various approaches to the alignment of t-rfs have been presented in the literature and tools for automatic alignment has been made available . however, although these methods are sound and can be rationally argued for, in our experience there are still problems with the alignment that remain unsolved, mainly due to the variation in estimated t-rf sizes. in this study we present a novel approach to evaluate and correct the alignment, which adjusts for differences in the estimated sizes of the t-rfs. standardization, or normalization, is important to remove differences between t-rf profiles due to differences in the amount of dna that has been loaded on the gel. as for t-rf alignment, several methods for normalization have been presented . the normalization procedures, as well as the subsequent comparison of t-rf profiles, can be based on either peak height or peak area data. the use of peak areas can be motivated by the observation that peak width increases and peak height decreases with increasing migration time through the gel <cit> . because of this, long fragments will result in broad and low peaks and will be underestimated if the relative abundances of t-rfs are based on peak heights. however, if peak areas are used, alterations in the relative abundances of the t-rfs may be produced by overlapping peaks. an evaluation also showed that the use of peak heights more accurately described the relative abundances of t-rfs derived from samples with defined amounts of different templates <cit> . to evaluate how the definition of total fluorescence affects the outcome, in this study we use both peak height and peak area, both in the comparisons of different normalization procedures and in the comparisons of t-rf profiles. some normalization methods have previously been evaluated. osborne et al. <cit> compared three different normalization methods: the constant percentage threshold procedure <cit> , the total fluorescence normalization procedure <cit> and the variable percentage threshold procedure <cit> . however, all three methods were based on peak area data and only three pairs of replicate samples were used to evaluate how well the normalization methods performed. moreover, it was not evaluated for how large variations in the amount of loaded dna the normalization methods were effective. in this study we evaluate two different normalization procedures and variants thereof and assess how large differences in initial total fluorescence that can be adjusted for. comparisons are also made with a third method, the noise filtering method by abdo et al. <cit> . the aims of this study are to improve available automatic alignment procedures, to evaluate the efficiency of different normalization methods and to evaluate the effect of combinations of pdt and alignment and normalization strategies on reproducibility. furthermore, the impact of the alignment and normalization methods on the results of comparative analyses of t-rf profiles is also evaluated. do the method choices make a great difference in the general interpretations of the results, or do the methods only change the results at a finer, perhaps negligible, level? the evaluations are done using four different datasets. a dilution series with dna concentrations from 17% to 100% is used to investigate the relation between total fluorescence and sample concentration, the effect of using single or consensus profiles and to evaluate the range of efficiency of a normalization procedure. a set of <dig> samples loaded twice is used to evaluate the variations in t-rf size estimations and the efficiency of different normalization methods. a set of t-rf profiles derived from dna-extraction replicates and pcr replicates is used to evaluate the efficiency of different combinations of peak detection threshold, alignment correction, and normalization methods. finally, a dataset from a longitudinal study of the bacterial community in an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant is used to evaluate the impact of different treatment combinations on subsequent comparative analyses of the t-rf profiles. RESULTS estimation of t-rf sizes the estimation of t-rf sizes based on the migration time through the gel depends on the length, the nucleotide composition and the secondary structure of the t-rfs <cit> . estimated t-rf lengths have been reported to be between one and eight bases longer or shorter than the true lengths <cit> . here we show that there is also a run-to-run variation in the estimation of the t-rf sizes. a set of <dig> samples was loaded twice on the capillary gel and the resulting t-rf profiles from the two loadings were compared. the differences in the estimated t-rf sizes between loading duplicates varied between <dig> and <dig> bases. the same variation range was observed for t-rfs of all sizes. the average difference was <dig> ± <dig> bases and for 90% of the t-rfs the size difference between the runs was lower than <dig> . thus, in most cases, the size variation is very low and will not affect the alignment and subsequent analyses. however, in the cases where the size difference is above <dig> , the alignment may be affected. alignment of t-rfs before a comparison of two t-rf profiles can be made they need to be aligned, by comparing the sizes of the t-rfs present in the profiles. this process of comparing t-rfs is often referred to as t-rf binning, by placing t-rfs of similar sizes in alignment bins. the easiest way to bin the t-rfs would perhaps be to convert the t-rf sizes, which are given with various decimals, to integers and then place all t-rfs of the same size in the same bins. however, two t-rfs of size <dig> and <dig> bases would then be added to different bins instead of the same. to enable a more accurate and faster alignment more complex automatic binning procedures are used where t-rfs are binned together if the distance between them is smaller than a pre-defined value . in this study, the moving average procedure described by smith et al. <cit> was used. for a small number of samples the automatic binning generally works well. however, for a large number of samples, with a high number of t-rfs that are close in size, binning can be problematic due to the variation in size estimations and the resulting alignment needs to be checked before further analysis. in the t-rflp data analysis work flow used in this study the alignment is evaluated by classifying the alignment bins as ambiguous or correct. alignment bins are classified as ambiguous if any of the t-rfs in the bin are within the given alignment range of a t-rf in another alignment bin. for alignments of only two profiles, as in the comparison of loading duplicates above, ambiguous alignment bins can be easily corrected, by binning the t-rfs that are most similar in size . for the alignment of more than two profiles the same approach does not work . for replicate profiles, as in the examples of additional file 1: tables s <dig> and s <dig> ambiguous alignment bins can be easily corrected, since ideally, the same t-rfs should be present in all profiles. however, when the t-rf profiles are derived from different samples and the purpose of the analysis is to detect and quantify similarities or differences in community composition, the alignment of the t-rfs is harder to correct. to illustrate the alignment problems that can arise, 38 t-rf profiles generated from activated sludge samples were analyzed and automatically aligned using the moving average procedure as described by smith et al <cit> . due to the large variation in size estimation and the high number of t-rfs with little size difference, <dig> of <dig> alignment bins were classified as ambiguous. figure <dig> shows an example of alignment bins classified as ambiguous.figure <dig> example of ambiguous alignment bins and correction using the systematic shift procedure. the different symbols represent the alignment bins generated by the automatic binning procedure. panel a shows the original alignment and panel b the alignment after correction for systematic shifts in the estimation of t-rf sizes. systematic shift correction the differences in the size estimations of the t-rfs are often systematic, i.e. all t-rfs in one profile are estimated as a little longer than the t-rfs in another profile. for example, for the <dig> activated sludge samples there are <dig> possible pair-wise comparisons of t-rf profiles. of these, <dig> comparisons, slightly more than half, showed a systematic shift in the size estimations. by adjusting the t-rf sizes and correcting for the systematic shift the alignment can be improved. figure <dig> illustrates the concept of systematic shift correction.figure <dig> concept of systematic shift correction. all t-rfs in profile <dig> are estimated as a little longer than the t-rfs in profile <dig> . a correction for the systematic shift facilitates the alignment . in figure <dig> it can be seen how the adjustment for systematic shifts reduces the variation in t-rf sizes between samples and allows for a better binning. before the adjustment it is uncertain if there should be one or two alignment bins, and if two, where the t-rfs should be binned. the systematic shift correction removes this uncertainty. note that, as stated above, there is not a systematic shift in the size estimations for all pair-wise comparisons so the systematic shift correction is not valid for all t-rf profiles. however, in the given example in figure <dig> the profiles with the shortest t-rfs all display a systematic shift towards the profiles with the longest t-rfs. it should also be noted that even though corrections for systematic shifts do help in resolving many ambiguous alignment bins, it does not always succeed. in the time series dataset there were <dig> alignment bins in the original alignment. <dig> of these, more than half, were determined to be ambiguous after initial inspection. by using the systematic shift correction as an aid to objectively resolve the alignment, the total number of bins was reduced to <dig> with only <dig> remaining ambiguous. total fluorescence and number of observed t-rfs there was a large variation in total fluorescence and in the number of observed t-rfs between the <dig> activated sludge samples in the time series dataset. the total number of t-rfs was clearly related to the total fluorescence: a high total fluorescence corresponds to a high number of t-rfs . however, division of the t-rfs into two groups, t-rfs with a relative abundance above and below 1%, showed that a high total fluorescence only increase the number of t-rfs of low relative abundance. the same pattern was observed independent if the total fluorescence was defined as the sum of peak heights or peak areas. the relation between total fluorescence and number of t-rfs has been observed previously by for example sait et al. <cit> . however, in their data the threshold where an increase in total fluorescence no longer correlated with an increased number of t-rfs was 5%, and not 1% as for the data presented here.figure <dig> number of t-rfs versus total fluorescence. the total number of t-rfs , the number of t-rfs with a relative abundance above 1% and below 1% are plotted against the total fluorescence of 38 t-rf profiles from activated sludge samples. total fluorescence was defined as the sum of all peak heights in a profile and the relative abundance of a t-rf was calculated as the peak height of the t-rf divided by the total fluorescence. the analysis of a series of dilutions of the same sample showed that the total fluorescence was related to the dna concentration in the sample . osborn et al. <cit> also investigated the relation between total fluorescence and sample dna concentration with the same results. the experiment was repeated here to provide data that could be used to evaluate how the differences in total fluorescence affect comparisons of the t-rf profiles and the efficiency of the normalization methods.figure <dig> total fluorescence versus dna concentration. total fluorescence was calculated as the sum of peak heights or peak areas . analysis of the loading duplicates dataset showed that differences in total fluorescence is not only dependent on concentration differences but also on the loading itself. the average difference in total fluorescence between two duplicates, as a percentage of the highest total fluorescence, was 17 ± 7% and the maximum difference was 33%. as the number of t-rfs in a profile depends on the total fluorescence of the profile, differences in total fluorescence can affect comparisons of t-rf profiles. the profiles in the dilution series were compared with the profiles of the undiluted sample using jaccard and bray-curtis similarities. for concentrations between 17% and 67% the similarity increased with increasing concentration . however, the profiles of the sample with concentration 83% showed lower similarities than the profiles of the 50% sample, due to the absence of several low abundance t-rfs.figure <dig> similarity versus dna concentration. jaccard and bray-curtis similarities between the profiles of all diluted samples in the dilution series and the profile of the non-diluted sample. each sample was loaded twice on the capillary gel. filled symbols represent the first loading and empty symbols the second loading. the profiles were analyzed using a pdt of <dig> in the loading duplicates dataset, the similarities decreased with increasing differences in total fluorescence when a pdt of <dig> was applied . the relatively low similarities were due to a high number of t-rfs not observed in both loadings. generally, both profiles had t-rfs not present in the other, not only the profile with the highest total fluorescence. most t-rfs that were only observed in one duplicate were of low relative abundance, on average <dig> % ± <dig> %. as a result, the bray-curtis similarities, which are calculated using the relative abundances of the t-rfs, were higher than the jaccard similarities, which put equal weight on all t-rfs . the same pattern was seen when the analysis was based on peak heights as when it was based on peak areas.figure <dig> similarity versus difference in total fluorescence. bray-curtis and jaccard similarities of <dig> loading duplicates plotted against difference in total fluorescence based on peak heights. the t-rf profiles were analyzed with a pdt of <dig> and a pdt of <dig> . applying a higher pdt removes the t-rfs with a low relative abundance. with a pdt of <dig> the average proportion of t-rfs only observed in one of the loading duplicates was reduced from 29 ± 8% to 16 ± 9% of all t-rfs in a loading duplicate pair. the similarities were also increased for <dig> of the <dig> profile pairs and the decrease in similarities for greater differences in total fluorescence was less marked . the same results were obtained independent if the analysis was based on peak heights or peak areas. blackwood et al. <cit> investigated the effect of different pdts on subsequent ordination analyses. however, contrary to the results presented here, they found that increasing the pdt from <dig> to <dig> or <dig> decreased the similarity between replicates. it is noteworthy that in the analysis using a pdt of <dig> one unique t-rf had a relative abundance of 43%. however, that t-rf was not observed in any of the loadings of two other pcr replicates of the same sample, and was therefore most likely an artifact. normalization five normalization procedures, three based on the total fluorescence normalization procedure <cit> and two using a fixed percentage threshold procedure <cit> , were evaluated using the loading duplicates dataset. the profiles were normalized pairwise and the profile pairs were then compared. the normalization procedures differed in the number of t-rfs they removed and in the resulting jaccard and bray-curtis similarities between the duplicates . before treatment the number of t-rfs increased with increasing total fluorescence. this pattern was still seen after treatment with tfn-areas and tfn-areas-lt, but not with tfn-heights, fpt-heights or fpt-areas . the tfn-areas procedures removed hardly any t-rfs and did not improve the jaccard similarities. however, the bray-curtis similarities were significantly increased. the tfn-heights treatment reduced the number of t-rfs the most but also increased both the jaccard and bray-curtis similarities the most. both of the fpt treatments reduced the number of t-rfs but for fpt-areas there was no significant difference in similarities compared to the untreated dataset. fpt-heights only improved the bray-curtis similarities. although removing more than half of the t-rfs, the tfn-heights treatment appear to be the best as it was the only treatment that increased the similarity between the duplicates, both when equal weight was given to all t-rfs and when relative abundances were taken into account .table

relative abundance are removed from the analysis from the start. these t-rfs may well be true t-rfs and could, although of low relative abundance, be of importance in the detection of differences between samples. however, with a pdt of <dig> there is a higher risk of including false t-rfs and artifacts. an example is the occasional observation of false t-rfs produced by so called spectral pull-up. although the fragments of the size standard and the sample are labeled with different fluorophores, a false signal can be detected in the frequency of the sample fluorophore when there is a very strong signal from the fragments of the size standard. however, the false t-rfs produced by spectral pull-up are of low peak heights and are removed when a pdt of <dig> is applied . the pdts used in the literature varies from low to high , presumably depending on the wish to either preserve as many of the true t-rfs as possible or to ensure removal of false t-rfs produced by noise peaks. based on the evaluation of the normalization treatments using the loading duplicates dataset, pdt <dig> and the tfn-heights normalization procedure seem to be the best analysis combination. the tfn-heights normalization seem to be the best procedure because it made a higher number of duplicate profiles more similar compared to the other treatments . a pdt of <dig> seems better than a pdt of <dig> because it reduces the risk of including false t-rfs in the analysis. in addition, the final number of t-rfs after normalization was not significantly different between the analyses using a pdt of <dig> or <dig> . in other words, although applying a high pdt initially results in a loss of data, after normalization the final number of t-rfs may be the same as if a lower pdt had been applied.table <dig> example of remaining number of t-rfs and total fluorescence after treatment average no of t-rfs average total fluorescence after pdt 50* after pdt 100* after normalization** after

normalization increased the similarities, it should be noted that the resulting jaccard and bray-curtis similarity after treatment is in most cases lower than 100%. this means that the treatment cannot correct completely for the differences observed in repeated loadings of the same sample. to evaluate how sensitive the normalization procedure is to increasing differences in total fluorescence between samples, the dilution series was analyzed, using the two loading duplicates for each dilution to create consensus profiles. a pdt of <dig> was applied and both replicates and consensus profiles were normalized using the tfn-heights procedure. no corrections of the alignments were necessary. the differences in total fluorescence ranged from 4% to 62% . very high similarities were observed between the undiluted sample and all other concentrations . the bray-curtis similarities with the non-diluted sample were for all but one dilution higher than 98% and the jaccard similarities were all but one 100%. the profile with lower similarities, dilution 3: <dig> had a t-rf not present in any other profile.figure <dig> similarity versus difference in total fluorescence. panel a:

similarity with sample “extr. <dig> pcr 1&2”. squares – bray-curtis similarity with sample “extr. <dig> pcr 1&2”. in the dna-extraction and pcr replicate dataset the differences in total fluorescence ranged from 10% to 48% . a pdt of <dig> was applied and both replicates and consensus profiles were normalized using the tfn-heights procedure. the alignment of the consensus profiles was corrected using the systematic shift correction procedure. after treatment the resulting jaccard and bray-curtis similarities with the profile with the highest total fluorescence were 92% as the lowest. the similarities did not decrease with increasing difference in total fluorescence . the differences between the profiles were due to the presence or absence of two t-rfs of low relative abundance and due to differences in the relative abundance of t-rfs present in all profiles . in the loading duplicate dataset the differences in total fluorescence ranged from 3% to 36% . a pdt of <dig> was applied and the duplicates were normalized using the tfn-heights procedure. the resulting jaccard similarities were between 60% and 100% and bray-curtis similarities ranged from 53% to 99%. for profile pairs with higher differences in total fluorescence there were greater increases in similarity after treatment compared to the similarity between non-normalized profiles than for profile pairs with little difference in total fluorescence. however, there was no apparent relation between the final similarity and the initial difference in total fluorescence . the efficiency of the normalization procedure does not seem to be directly affected by how large the difference in total fluorescence is, at least not up to 62% differences. however, the similarities are not always increased up to 100%, which should be taken into account in comparisons of community composition. consensus profiles the observation of differences between loading duplicates before and after normalization, whether artifacts or due to differences in the amount of loaded dna, highlights the need to use consensus profiles of either loading, enzyme digestion or pcr duplicates instead of relying on single profiles for comparisons of different samples. as suggested by dunbar et al. <cit> consensus profiles can be created from replicate profiles by only including t-rfs that are observed in all replicates, and using the average values for sizes, peak heights and peak areas. the dilution series dataset was used to evaluate the difference between comparisons of samples using single profiles or consensus profiles of loading duplicates . when consensus profiles were used both jaccard and bray-curtis similarities were slightly higher than then when single profiles were used. data processing strategies to further evaluate the effect of combinations of pdt, alignment correction and different normalization procedures on the comparisons of t-rf profiles, a dataset was created from two dna-extraction replicate samples, resulting in seven t-rf profile pairs. the dataset was analyzed in <dig> different ways, including <dig> using the normalization and alignment schemes provided in the t-rex software <cit> and <dig> using the normalization procedure by abdo et al. <cit> combined with the alignment procedure presented in this study. the seven consensus profiles were then compared using jaccard and bray-curtis similarities . as a comparison, the six t-rf profiles that were used to create the dataset were also analyzed as single profiles, without generating consensus profiles. the highest similarities were obtained by applying a high peak detection threshold, correcting the alignment and normalizing both duplicate profiles and all consensus profiles using the tfn-heights procedure . note that the lowest similarities using this treatment was 92%, meaning that as in the analysis of loading duplicates, the treatment cannot always correct for all differences introduced by the sample processing. both the normalization strategies and the t-rf alignment procedure presented here can be said to be conservative in the sense that only data with a high level of certainty is used. in the normalization procedure, t-rfs are removed from the profiles with a high total fluorescence to avoid differences between profiles caused by differences in the amount of loaded dna. in the alignment procedure presented here alignment bins that remain classified as ambiguous even after correction for systematic shifts are removed from any further analysis. the reason for doing this is to avoid introducing similarities or differences between t-rf profiles based on erroneous alignment binning. the result is that a lot of information in the original data is sacrificed in order to retain a high reliability and accuracy in the comparisons of the t-rf profiles. table <dig> shows an example of how many t-rfs and how much of the total fluorescence that are lost in the different data treatment steps. community dynamics analysis the time series dataset of <dig> activated sludge samples was analyzed in nine different ways to evaluate the effect of different data treatments on the outcome of analyses of the dynamics of the community. the resulting t-rf profiles were then analyzed using jaccard and bray-curtis similarities to assess the stability and the rate of change of the bacterial community.figure <dig> community stability: bray-curtis similarity between all profiles and the profile of the first sample in the time series. the data was treated in nine different ways before calculation of bray-curtis similarities . panel a: pdt <dig> tfn-a, b: pdt <dig> tfn-h, c: pdt <dig> nonorm, d: pdt <dig> nonorm, noalcorr, e: pdt <dig> tfn-h, f: pdt <dig> tfn-h repnorm, g: trex-a, h: trex-h, i: trex-h round-up. the treatments are described in additional file 1: table s <dig> community stability: jaccard similarity between all profiles and the profile of the first sample in the time series. the data was treated in nine different ways before calculation of jaccard similarities . panel a: pdt <dig> tfn-a, b: pdt <dig> tfn-h, c: pdt <dig> nonorm, d: pdt <dig> nonorm, noalcorr, e: pdt <dig> tfn-h, f: pdt <dig> tfn-h repnorm, g: trex-a, h: trex-h, i: trex-h round-up. the treatments are described in additional file 1: table s <dig> when the stability of the community was assessed by bray-curtis similarities there was little difference between most treatments . the treatments that differed were the treatments that did not include correction of the alignment: the no alignment correction, no normalization treatment and the three t-rex treatments. the t-rex treatment that used the simple round-up/down approach to alignment differed the most from the others and suggested that there were much bigger differences between samples than any of the other treatments. notably, alignment of t-rf profiles using the round-up/down approach has been used in studies evaluating other aspects of t-rflp data analysis e.g. . as argued by others , the results presented here show that the round-up/down approach is not preferable. the other treatments without alignment correction differed the most for a number of samples in the middle of the time series. the difference is due to the erroneous alignment of several t-rfs present in the samples from that period. that the other treatments did not differ very much can be attributed to the abundance distribution of the t-rfs. for all samples the t-rf profile is dominated by a few t-rfs with a relatively high abundance. since the bray-curtis coefficient gives more weight to abundant t-rfs the removal of low abundant t-rfs by the different normalization methods or by applying a higher pdt does not affect the outcome that much. however, when the stability is assessed using jaccard similarities, which give equal weight to all t-rfs, no treatment results in the same pattern as another . the rate of change, i.e. how much the community composition changes between each sample, was evaluated the same way as the community stability, using bray-curtis and jaccard similarities. likewise, in the assessment using bray-curtis similarities , all treatments except the ones without alignment correction showed similar patterns, and when jaccard similarities were used all treatments resulted in different patterns. ordination analysis different treatments of the t-rf profiles will result in different clustering of samples. figure <dig> shows the nmds ordination of untreated t-rf profiles and profiles that were treated with alignment correction and normalization of both replicates and consensus profiles. in both ordinations the samples cluster in groups corresponding to the time of sample collection. one group, samples from summer <dig> is spread out and overlaps the other groups in the ordination of untreated data while it clusters more tight and is separated from the other groups in the ordination based on alignment corrected and normalized data. the treatment procedures that include alignment correction all resulted in nmds ordinations with similar clustering when bray-curtis similarities were used. when the ordination was based on jaccard similarities small differences could be observed between all treatments.figure <dig> impact of data treatment on ordination. nmds analysis based on bray-curtis similarities of t-rf profiles analyzed with pdt <dig> without alignment correction or normalization and t-rf profiles analyzed with pdt <dig> with alignment correction

summer <dig> filled circles – autumn <dig> empty triangles – winter <dig> empty squares – spring/summer <dig> empty circles – late summer <dig> correlation analysis with environmental parameters the correction of ambiguous alignment bins and the removal of t-rfs by normalization change the dynamic pattern of t-rfs in the final alignment bins. therefore, the type of treatment affects the results of combined analyses of t-rflp data and environmental parameters. a simple analysis to detect t-rfs that are possibly affected by or might have an effect on environmental parameters is a correlation analysis using t-rf abundance data and environmental parameter data. table <dig> shows the parameters that correlated significantly with four t-rfs after three different treatments. different conclusions regarding the possible importance of the t-rfs for sludge characteristics would have been drawn from the three different treatments. for example, with treatment a and c the t-rf of size <dig> bases showed a statistically significant correlation with the effluent suspended solids, whereas with treatment b it did not. likewise, the t-rf of size <dig> bases showed a statistically significant correlation with the shear sensitivity after treatment a and b but not after treatment c. which t-rfs, i.e. which groups of bacteria, that would be determined to have a possible role in for example sludge settling properties or floc stability would thus depend on how the data was treated.table <dig> correlations between t-rf abundances and wwtp process parameters t-rf size treatment

CONCLUSIONS we acknowledge that some of the conclusions presented here may be specific for the particular system that we used, since the variations in t-rf abundances and sizes are related to the dna loading and t-rf detection system. however, the discussions regarding alignment and normalization approaches are still relevant, independent of the system used. we conclude that comparisons of single t-rf profiles from different samples are not reliable, due to variability in detection of low-abundant t-rfs and detection of false t-rfs. reproducibility can be increased by adapting a high detection threshold and by the combination of two profiles in a consensus profile before comparisons between samples. normalization of t-rf profiles, both duplicates and consensus profiles, to adjust for the variation in the amount of dna loaded on the gel, was also shown to contribute to the reproducibility. of the different normalization methods that were evaluated, all commonly used, the tfn-heights method was the most efficient. although the arguments for using peak areas as the basis of the analysis of t-rfs are valid, the evaluation presented here show that peak heights are preferred. there can be a large variation in the estimation of t-rf sizes between samples, which affects the alignment of t-rfs and subsequent comparisons of samples. in alignments of t-rfs from a large number of samples, current automated alignment methods are not entirely reliable, as alignment errors may remain. an additional step, adjusting for systematic shifts in t-rf size estimations between t-rf profiles, was presented here and shown to improve the alignment of t-rfs. we show that t-rflp data analysis method choices can determine the conclusions drawn from analyses comparing the community composition between samples, correlation analyses with environmental parameters and analyses of community dynamics patterns. generally, when t-rflp is used, at least one of these three analyses is the main tool to answer the proposed research question. this study shows that a conservative approach to normalization and alignment, although resulting in a loss of information, ensures that the results of the t-rflp analysis are reproducible and reliable.",

an information rich science and created the field of bioinformatics. in parallel to this, storage requirements have grown from storing a human genome reference sequence <cit> , to handling the increasing volumes of variation data. earlier projects used dense genotyping technologies on individuals . more recently, large-scale resequencing of whole genomes and selected functional regions is taking place in the <dig> genomes project for human <cit> and <dig> genomes project for arabidopsis <cit> . genome-wide association studies, such as that performed by the wellcome trust case control consortium <cit> , are using the recent generation of genotyping chips and creating data sets on a new scale. there is a demand for databases designed to manage the growing amount of variation information. an infrastructure is necessary that facilitates data analysis and integration with existing genome annotation. storing dense variation data for many individuals in any naive manner requires a large amount of disk space, a requirement that is only likely to increase in coming years. public resources of variation data in parallel with advances in data production technology, the bioinformatics infrastructure required to manage, organise and analyse the data has also evolved. a number of databases were originally designed to capture variation data and organise it with respect to the genome assembly. ultimately the effort and expense required to maintain and continually update these resources over time were not available, and many of the previous public databases of variation data, such as those provided by the snp consortium <cit> and hgvbase <cit> , have either changed their focus or stopped active development. indeed, the management of large-scale variation data is currently limited to only a few projects including ensembl <cit> , the ucsc genome browser <cit> and dbsnp <cit> . in addition, there are numerous highly curated and special purpose databases, including locus-specific databases <cit> and those dedicated to specific applications, such as seattlesnps which focuses on associations between snps and inflammatory response pathways <cit> . the most comprehensive resource is dbsnp, which serves as both a publication and permanent archive for variation data. access to the data is provided visually, via a web interface, and also for bulk data download from an ftp site, allowing users to create a local copy of the data. the physical size of dbsnp and its complex schema structure means that creating a local copy is generally a job for an experienced programmer with significant computational resources <cit> . the ucsc genome browser provides access to the dbsnp data in the form of an annotation track. the data is made available after each dbsnp build is completed and is provided both visually through the browser interface and by data download. variation data mining is supported at ucsc through the use of tools such as the table browser <cit> . ensembl ensembl is a comprehensive genome information system that provides variation data resources alongside many other interconnected components, including the ensembl genome browser at http://www.ensembl.org. ensembl is updated approximately five times each year with new genome assemblies and additional data as it becomes available. in release number <dig> ensembl fully supports over <dig> genomes, of which <dig> currently have variation data associated with them. in order to integrate variation data into the existing ensembl resources, a dedicated variation database and api is required to support the web site and other bioinformatics tools <cit> . this report presents a detailed description of the ensembl variation database and application programming interface . as with the other ensembl databases, the variation database is based on an open source mysql database <cit> infrastructure. the variation database schema is presented in summary in figure <dig> and the full schema is included as additional file 1: supplemental figure s <dig> it is designed explicitly to deal with both large-scale, dense genotyping data and resequencing data covering thousands of individual genome sequences. the database provides all of the data visible on the ensembl web site, as well as the supporting data that is only available through the ensembl api. the api is one of the distinguishing features of ensembl and provides a programmatic interface to all ensembl data across all supported organisms. as a result, a script based on a given version of the api will work with all databases corresponding to that version and there is no need for species-specific programming. there is also a data-mining tool, biomart <cit> , which is tightly integrated with the data resources. implementation the variation api the variation api is designed for optimal interaction with the database and provides a powerful and comprehensive interface to the variation data. it is written in object-oriented perl <cit> and follows the same general conventions as the wider ensembl api <cit> . multiple retrieval methods are provided in each of the object adaptors, allowing the user to create, for example, single variation objects given a specific identifier, or sets of objects such as a list of all variation feature objects mapped within a particular gene. all object types and methods are fully documented in online pod documentation, which is also available in html format via the ensembl website http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/pdoc/index.html, along with a series of tutorials introducing the user to the api http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/index.html. the example code in figure <dig> shows how the ensembl api can be used to retrieve sequence variation from a specific mouse strain and then, for each locus, print how the strain compares to the reference sequence. first, the api creates a slice for the genomic region of interest. then, the get_all_allelefeatures_slice method is called to retrieve the alleles for this genomic slice. the example code classifies the genotype at each locus using a general algorithm, which could be used for both homozygous inbred genomes such as laboratory mouse strains or outbred heterozygous individuals. finally, the example code outputs the resulting variants and sequence for the non-reference individual. the db connection adaptor also supports the attachment of multiple variation databases supporting, for example, seamless integration of publicly available databases at ensembldb.ensembl.org and internal data which may be subject to access restrictions due to patient confidentially or other reasons. full details of the ensembl api conventions are available at http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/index.html. the api is used by the ensembl website http://www.ensembl.org and can also be used for custom analysis, on any combination of the public databases or the user's own data. storage and retrieval of variation data database requirements and design considerations ensembl stores a variety of different data types including variants on the genome from external sources such as dbsnp and those resulting from ensembl's internal snp calling pipeline <cit> . other data result from resequencing projects or dense genotyping projects that are based on affymetrix, illumina and other high-throughput genotyping platforms. in addition, the database provides the predicted consequences of each variant in the context of the evidence-based ensembl gene annotations and a representation of resequencing information that is compact and supports a visual presentation. the way the different data types are stored in the variation database is discussed below while a more in-depth explanation of the data itself can be found in chen et al <cit> . variation data in ensembl, a sequence variant is defined by its upstream and downstream flanking sequences along with at least one variant allele. the flanking sequence of each variant is aligned to one or more positions in the reference genome. to accurately reflect this relationship there exists in the schema two distinct table sets : the variation, flanking sequence and allele tables store the most basic information for each variant in the database independently of its position on an assembly, while the variation feature table contains mappings for each variant to the reference sequence. this division of data means that only the variation feature table needs to be updated when there is a new assembly released and the variation table remains consistent regardless of the assembly. mappings for each variant are imported directly from dbsnp or are generated by aligning the composite 5' flanking sequence, reference allele and 3' flanking sequence to the reference sequence using the ssaha <dig> alignment software <cit> . after import or mapping, the size of the flanking sequence table can be greatly reduced by replacing raw sequences with a set of coordinates when the sequence exactly matches the reference sequence at its mapped location. as discussed below, the api seamlessly restores the flanking sequence not directly stored in the database with the appropriate sequence drawn from the associated ensembl core database. when a variant maps at least once, but no more than n times, these mappings are stored in the variation feature table . variants that fail to map to the genome, or map more than n times, are recorded in the failed variation table and no mappings will be stored in the variation feature table for the given variant. further quality control criteria are also applied: variants with alleles that do not match the reference sequence at the location of mapping are also moved to the failed variation table . a 'white list' of variants, such as those with clinical significance, will not be moved to the failed variation table even if they meet one of the above criteria. all supplementary data pertaining to variants in the failed variation table, including alleles and genotypes, are deleted from the database before release. ensembl also stores structural variants and copy number data. the location of these features is harder to define due to the uncertainly of their boundaries. for this reason, they are stored in a separate structural variation table which allows for start and end positions to be defined as a range between a minimum and maximum value. individuals and population genotypes: genotype compression large-scale and dense genotype data, such as that produced by the hapmap project, requires significant disk space to store in a naïve database implementation or as flat-file data <cit> . in the initial implementation, ensembl kept all genotype data in a table designed to store single base pair genotypes using an approach that dedicated one row per genotype in the table. based on the more than <dig> billion human genotypes available in ensembl release <dig> , this single table would currently be more than <dig> gb in size. moreover, accessing the table to provide data for the ensembl web displays <cit> would require impractical database lookup times. to address this problem, a simple and efficient compression algorithm was created for storing an encoded representation of the genotype data. this compact structure, discussed below, reduces the size of the table to only <dig> million entries, which require approximately <dig> gb of disk space. each row in the compressed table stores genotypes from one individual in one fixed-size region of the genome . a binary field in the row stores a compressed string consisting of a repeating triplet of elements: a distance in base pairs from the previous genotype followed by a pair of alleles. using distances rather than absolute chromosomal positions minimises the number of bytes required to store these integers. along with fields describing the position of the given region, methods in the api can decode the compressed string into a set of genotypes at any position in the genome. for example, a given row may have a start position of <dig> indicating the chromosomal position of the first genotype in this row. the unpacked genotypes field then may contain the following elements: the first genotype has a position of and alleles a and g. the second genotype has a position of and alleles c and c, the third genotype similarly has a position of <dig> and alleles g and t, the fourth position <dig> and alleles a and a, and so on. in practice, since the first genotype in the set will always be at the chromosomal position specified in the row's position field, the <dig> shown above is not explicitly stored, but is added by the api as part of the decoding process. in this way the database is optimised for the efficient access of all of the data in a particular genomic region, a decision made in part to enable optimal real-time display of the data in the ensembl genome browser. genotypes for other types of variants, including insertions, deletions, repeat features and larger structural variants are stored in a separate, uncompressed multiple base pair genotype table. population level data population-level data is also stored in the schema. specifically, the allele table stores observed population allele frequencies, while the population genotype table stores observed genotype frequencies. these frequencies are imported from dbsnp, and hence include reference populations from sources such as the hapmap project and those genotyped by perlegen. real-time calculation of linkage disequilibrium linkage disequilibrium data provided through the ensembl web interface is calculated \"on-the-fly\" using a highly efficient c program. calculating ld data in such a manner negates the need for a large and unwieldy table containing millions of pairwise r <dig> and d' values. the program implements a version of the standard em algorithm for the estimation of pairwise haplotype frequencies from unphased genotype data, providing a similar level of accuracy to that seen in the popular haploview program <cit> . ld data can be produced in this way via the api, or be visualised in the classic 'inverted triangle' display via the web interface . resequencing data as the cost of dna sequencing has reduced dramatically over the last decade, an increasing number of resequencing studies are being performed, generating many new variants <cit> . although resequencing data in the form of sequencing reads is normally stored in the european nucleotide archive http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/ or genbank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/, optimal representation of these data should take into account that the vast majority of the sequence will be the same as the reference assembly. thus the database stores only two components of the resequencing data, which allow the recreation of essentially all of the information: alignment positions of the sequence reads, represented as coordinates with read coverage levels, and differences between the alignments and the reference genome assembly, stored as variations. these differences may be single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions or larger structural variations. phenotypic information the schema also allows for the storage of phenotypic information associated with particular variants, along with any relevant association data such as risk alleles and p-values, in the variation annotation table. multiple annotations may be linked with an individual variation object in the database for such situations as when alleles may have different disease associations. these phenotype data are fully indexed and searchable through the ensembl web interface. haplotypic and pseudo-autosomal regions the ensembl core database schema includes an explicit representation of haplotypic regions that appear, for example, in the mhc region of human chromosome <dig> this data structure allows for these regions to be stored and managed as efficiently as possible. the variation database supports this data structure by allowing multiple haplotypic variation feature objects to correspond to one variation object, but correctly considers that each of the variation objects only map to a single place in the reference genome. importantly, this data structure supports the appropriate variations on the various haplotypes. consequences of variants the tight integration of the ensembl variation database and api with the other components of the ensembl architecture allows the derivation of novel and biologically relevant data. methods in the api allow the prediction of consequence types of variants on the transcripts to which they map by assessing the change that each variant allele causes in the reference sequence. these consequence types include, but are not limited to: non-synonymous amino acid changes in protein coding transcripts; stop codon gain or loss; frame shifts caused by insertions or deletions; variants located within splice sites or regulatory regions. from a variant's position with respect to a transcript, a consequence type is calculated and stored in the transcript variation table. in addition, ensembl is unique in providing an api method to predict consequence types for novel variant positions, given a genomic location and an allele. RESULTS the ensembl model consists of one variation database for each supported species with the associated genome sequence data and genome annotations, such as protein coding genes, available in the ensembl core databases . the variation databases vary in size depending on the amount of data available for a given species and range, for example in release <dig> from a size of <dig> gb for human, to <dig> mb for zebrafish. ensembl is designed to be used for data access in a variety of methods, serving the diverse requirements of the scientific community. the web interface caters to those who wish to view variation data in the context of the other genomic annotation offered by ensembl, and offers unique representations and visualisations of the data. for those wishing to extract large volumes of data, biomart can be used to filter and retrieve such data through a highly configurable interface. the variation api can be used in conjunction with the other ensembl apis to make queries across all the databases, offering programmatic access to the full range of data stored in ensembl's public databases. the large ensembl codebase can be incorporated into pipelines and custom software, as well as providing a comprehensive and expandable interface to a user's own data. the variation database schema and api are regularly updated to include new functionality and refinements of existing methods. these software updates are released in sync with the rest of ensembl and in conjunction with updates to the data content of variation databases. thus each release consists of new data, changes associated with new genome assemblies and annotation and the corresponding changes to the api. taken together these resources provide a comprehensive and unique solution for the management and analysis of variation data. the database and api described here share some functionality with the tools available for other genome browsers. for example, the ucsc genome browser stores variation data in tables that represent locations of variation, genotyped snps, etc <cit> . these tables can be visualised as tracks on the ucsc genome browser <cit> or used by the ucsc table browser to create more complex queries across multiple data tables available at ucsc <cit> . however, the full flexibility of analysis enabled by the variation api is unique to ensembl as are the federated queries that are available through the ensembl variation biomart <cit> . moreover, the variation objects described here can be implemented with an identical interface by other projects. in this way the variation objects can serve as \"common currency\" for a consistent analysis across data available in a number of different physical locations each stored in databases with different schema and potentially different database platforms. the variation database and api are currently deployed in a number of projects beyond ensembl. for example, they provide a portion of the variation data infrastructure for the <dig> genomes project <cit> and the gramene project <cit> . future as the cost of sequencing technologies decreases and the sequencing of individual genomes from the <dig> genomes project and other projects becomes more commonplace, it is likely that further development will be required in order to maintain optimal data storage efficiency while also being able to retrieve the data in a timely fashion. in addition, there will be additional developments in the api for new data queries such as retrieving summary information for variants across a number of individuals from the same population or to retrieve the sequence of a particular individual, breed or strain. although ensembl focuses on chordate species, the recently launched ensembl genomes project at the ebi will extend ensembl technology to the analysis of a wider variety of genomes <cit> . these requirements will necessitate extension of the capabilities of the variation database and api to support specific characteristics of non-diploid genomes such as those found in plants and yeast. CONCLUSIONS ensembl's tools for variation and resequencing data are designed to solve the large-scale data analysis, storage and visualisation challenges presented by current and next generation genotyping and sequencing platforms. the platform is extensively tested and heavily used as the software library and database interface for the ensembl genome browser and other projects built with ensembl technology. availability and requirements project name: ensembl project homepage: http://www.ensembl.org. operating system: platform independent programming language: the ensembl api is written in perl with supporting c functions as described above. other requirements: the ensembl api requires bioperl <dig> . <dig> additional requirements apply to users wanting to install a full ensembl mirror site as described at http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/webcode/index.html. license: all of the code described in this article is freely available under the terms of the ensembl software license found at http://www.ensembl.org/info/about/code_licence.html additional information and on-line tutorials the database schema is described here in http://cvs.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ensembl-variation/schema/. http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/variation/index.htmlhttp://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/variation/variation_tutorial.html. authors' contributions the database schema was designed by as, eb, dr and wm with contributions from yc, pf and fc. the api was written by dr with contributions from as, wm and yc. yc, wm and dr have built the variation databases available at ensembl. pf, wm and fc wrote the paper with contributions from dr and input from all of the other authors. all authors have read and approved the final manuscript. supplementary material additional file 1 supplemental figure s1: full variation database schema. click here for file acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the following individuals and organisations: graham mcvicker for his early work on the variation database design and schema; solexa for access to resequencing data; guy coates, pete clapham and tim cutts for maintaining the ensembl computer systems; the other members of the greater ensembl group at the ebi and the wellcome trust sanger institute; and all of ensembl's users, especially those who have taken the time to contact us with suggestions and other helpful comments. the ensembl project is funded primarily by the wellcome trust. current and previous sources of additional funding for ensembl's variation resources include embl, the european union and the uk medical research council.",

    "prompt": "Write a short summary of the patient's vital signs and labs. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND whole genome sequence data is currently unavailable for the overwhelming majority of plant species, including most crops. for such cases, the integration of linkage and physical maps provides a vital information platform to accelerate processes such as positional cloning, comparative genome analysis, and clone-by-clone sequencing <cit> . one key limiting step in compiling a comprehensive link between physical and linkage maps is the ability to locate large insert clones that contain the polymorphic markers used in linkage mapping. traditionally, this has been achieved by colony hybridisation using radioactively-labelled cloned dna, pcr products, or oligonucleotides <cit> . there are several disadvantages of using colony hybridisation as a means of identifying clones that contain target dna; these largely centre on the difficulty in setting appropriate hybridization conditions to minimise false positive and false negative results, but also include the need for appropriate facilities and procedures to handle radio-labelled probes <cit> . these problems can be overcome if a pcr-based screening strategy is adopted using sequence tagged site markers <cit> . several authors have argued that the efficiency of pcr-based screening can be greatly improved through the use of structured multidimentional bac pooling strategies <cit> . compared with hybridization to high-density colony filters, the pcr screening of multidimentional bac pools is less prone to the confounding effects of repetitive elements and tends to be more cumbersome when radiolabels are used <cit> . issues of error arise from both approaches, however, with the relative abundance of type <dig> and type <dig> errors varying according to post-hybridization wash stringency or pcr annealing temperatures respectively. importantly, the number of independent amplifications required to determine a clone's address can be reduced by smart pooling strategies. the use of conventional pcr for bac pool screening to anchor genetic markers to physical maps with a high throughput retains some shortcomings, most notably the common need to: i) isolate and normalise dna from a large number of clones to ensure that sufficient template is available from each bac for reliable amplification of single copy targets by conventional pcr. ii) anchor and score each marker separately . iii) use agarose gel electrophoresis as crude verification of the fidelity of target amplification. this last step is simple but comparatively slow and difficult to automate. to overcome these limitations we describe a robust method for anchoring genetic markers in physical maps based on screening two-dimensional bac pools using a combination of a modified multiplex-tandem pcr and high resolution melt analysis . we demonstrate for a. thaliana that this strategy opens the possibility of direct screening of a bac library using pooled freezing stocks for pcr with high throughput, at low cost, and a minimum risk of false positive/negative results. RESULTS rationale of the method bac library screening usually requires dna extraction from the bac pools <cit> to increase template accessibility sufficiently to allow reliable amplification by conventional pcr. we addressed the problem of low dna template in bac pools using a modification of multiplex-tandem pcr . the mt-pcr protocol was originally developed to amplify rare transcripts from cdna pools <cit> but was subsequently adapted for use on genomic dna samples <cit> . the technique first comprises a truncated pre-amplification step that typically consists of 15- <dig> cycles so that pcr amplification is arrested in the log-linear phase and template concentration ratios are broadly retained. importantly, this stage is highly amenable for multiplexing . after dilution, selective amplification is performed by conventional pcr for each locus separately using either identical primers to those used for pre-amplification or new primers targeting internal sites <cit> . the value of mt-pcr lies in its ability to reliably amplify from low copy template within mixed samples. this property makes the technique highly attractive for bac library screening for low copy targets and opens the possibility of direct screening from freezing stocks rather than from isolated bac dna. there remains, however, a need for a high-speed, low-cost system to verify identity of the amplicons generated by pcr and also to distinguish pcr products from primer dimers in a gel-free environment . high resolution melt analysis is a powerful tool for high throughput mutation detection <cit> and genotyping <cit> . it therefore provides an attractive means of verifying the identity of pcr amplicons from bac pools . the advantage of hrm over other genotyping technologies for this purpose reside in its simplicity, high speed and low cost, the capacity to detect differences based on size and sequence, and the consistency of data output over a wide range of targets <cit> . hrm analysis monitors alteration in fluorescence caused by the release of an intercalating dye from the double-stranded dna of pcr products as they dissociate with increasing temperatures. differences between pcr products are revealed by melting temperature shifts representing minor sequence or size variations <cit> . recent advance in fluorescence-detecting instruments allows hrm to be performed immediately following amplification and to be completed within <dig> min. careful selection of amplicons that have non-overlapping melt profiles also opens up the possibility of multiplexing hrm analysis . multiplex pre-amplification and hrm analysis make bac library screening easy and minimize the risk of false positive or false negative results that can appear when pooled freezing stocks are directly used for pcr. our mt-pcr-hrm-based protocol describes a rapid and robust way to identify low abundance positive clones within large insert libraries. a positive superpool is identified by n/ <dig> mt-pcr-hrm reactions where n is the number of 384-well plates of the bac library and a super pool contained <dig> 384-well plates . a positive plate will be defined by two positive matrix pools after <dig> mt-pcr-hrm reactions. the positive clone of a given plate is identified by the same 2d pooling strategy from four positive single pools after <dig> pcr-hrm reactions . in total n/ <dig> + <dig> mt-pcr-hrm reactions are needed for each marker when tested separately . the number of mt-pcr-hrm reactions can be reduced when up to three suitable markers are combined into a single mt-pcr-hrm. estimated number of pools and mt-pcr-hrm reactions required to find a single marker within the denoted genomes, assuming a 3× coverage and <dig> kb average insert size for the corresponding bac libraries. note: *1× coverage = <dig> single pools ; 3× coverage = <dig> single pools the practical example we use a. thaliana as an exemplar to demonstrate the usefulness of mt-pcr-hrm in combination with a multidimensional bac pooling strategy for the anchoring of markers into physical maps. the experimental design comprises of three main steps: 1) pooling of bac freezing stocks; 2) multiplex pre-amplification of bac pools with up to <dig> primer pairs; 3) localisation of positive bac clones by identifying the positive subset of pools via selective amplification followed by hrm analysis to confirm locus identity. 1) pooling strategy for pcr screening of a genomic bac library the size of large insert libraries is normally adjusted according to the haploid genome size, the mean insert size and the expected genome coverage of the library. a typical bac library has approximately <dig> kb average insert size. it is recommended to use a bac library with at least <dig> times coverage for pcr-based screening purposes <cit> . such genomic bac libraries are typically stored in microtiter plates in a 384-well format. several pooling strategies can be applied for pcr-based screening. the number of dimensions deployed in a pooling strategy defines the number subsets of pools that may contain a specific bac clone. screening techniques based on conventional pcr normally require 3-d or 6-d pooling systems <cit> in order to ensure reliable amplification from a single bac clone. with the more sensitive and accurate mt-pcr-hrm technique, a two-dimension pooling strategy is sufficient. for studies aiming to anchor genetic markers into physical maps of large genomes, the minimum number of screening reactions is decisive in setting labour and consumables costs. the pooling strategy proposed here allows screening of millions of clones with as few as the number of superpools plus <dig> mt-pcr-hrm reactions . based on our experience, each super pool should not comprise more than twenty five 384-well plates. using <dig> μl per bac clone, a super pool contains in total <dig> × <dig> × <dig> μl . in our illustrative example, an a. thaliana library <cit> was used that contained twenty four 384-well plates. to evaluate whether the enhanced sensitivity of this method has utility for organisms with much larger genomes, we simulated 'rare single locus' hits in a substantially larger library by creating a superpool containing <dig> μl of a single positive bac clone and <dig> negative bac clones of <dig> μl each. we were able to exploit this approach to estimate the capability of the technique to detect single locus hits for genomes of much larger size . according to the proposed pooling strategy, the required number of super pools for a typical 3× coverage bac library with a <dig> kb average insert size is estimated for several important genomes . for genomes larger than <dig> mb, the number of pcrs required to anchor one genetic marker is approximately equivalent. the number of plates per superpool can be varied in a certain frame according to the genome size of the organism under study. 2) mt-pcr pre-amplification applying a suitable pooling strategy, the number of pcr amplifications required to identify the positive bac clones can be reduced significantly. however, because of a low template concentration for sts sites and further dilution by e. coli dna, conventional pcr-based screening may over-dilute single locus targets to such an extent that amplifications often fail. dna extraction from the bacs is required for better template accessibility <cit> . instead, we introduced a multiplex pre-amplification step on super bac pools directly from freezing stocks, applying up to <dig> primer pairs simultaneously. before pre-amplification, it has to be confirmed that each primer pair applied works individually on total genomic dna by pcr-hrm. the pre-amplification increases the sensitivity and specificity of mt-pcr-hrm on pooled templates . without pre-amplification a higher cycle number is generally required for conventional pcr , yielding an excessively high background to product ratio . 3) identification of marker-containing bac clones by high resolution melting analysis hrm curve analysis after pcr-hrm provides a rapid, sensitive means for the bac screening. the rotor-gene™ <dig> with a real-time rotary analyzer prevents unwanted temperature deviation inside the thermal cycler <cit> . furthermore, intercalating dye improves hrm sensitivity, allows omission of the gel electrophoresis step and enhances true positive hit rates <cit> . the positive bac pools yield clear melting curves instead of a background line as obtained in the case of negative bac pools . because melting curve analysis can differentiate between divergent sequences, the option of a multiplex pcr for up to <dig> loci is applicable to reduce consumables and labour . the entire mt-pcr-hrm run for a single locus can be completed within <dig> minutes. the same approach is applicable to organisms of much larger genome sizes . for example, using the tri-plex mt-pcr-hrm option in which three loci exhibiting non-overlapping melt profiles are combined into a single reaction, only <dig> pcrs are required to screen approximately <dig> clones of the <dig> gbp wheat genome for each of three markers represented in individual bac . thus, this strategy potentially opens the possibility for high throughput-low cost screening across even very large genomes. besides the integration of genetic and physical maps, the potential of this protocol is to support ongoing genome sequencing projects e.g., for barley http://barleygenome.org/, wheat http://www.wheatgenome.org/, potato http://www.potatogenome.net/, swine http://piggenome.org/, cattle http://www.bovinegenome.org etc. CONCLUSIONS here, the new mt-pcr-hrm technology has been applied to bac matrix pools for simple, low-cost and high-throughput anchoring of genetic markers to physical maps. using a bac library of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana, we were able to show that mt-pcr-hrm can get reliable amplification of single copy targets from freezing stocks equivalent to twenty five 384-well plate super pools. a two-dimension pooling strategy can locate a target clone within a superpool by <dig> reactions. the method also allows effective multiplexing to screen, in parallel, <dig> genetic markers in one mt-pcr-hrm reaction and is particularly suited for genome characterisation initiatives.",

RESULTS several avenues of investigation were pursued to substantiate the predicted clathrin-binding activity of hps <dig> these studies employed the techniques of immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, live cell imaging, and immunoelectron microscopy. immunoprecipitation whole cell lysates prepared from normal melanocytes and from hps <dig> null melanocytes, i.e., cells from a patient homozygous for the <dig> -kb hps <dig> founder deletion <cit> , exhibited approximately equal amounts of clathrin . each whole cell lysate was then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal hps <dig> peptide antibodies. clathrin, detected by antibodies to its heavy chain, co-immunoprecipitated with hps <dig> in the normal lysates but not in the hps <dig> null lysates . these results were obtained using either of two different monoclonal anti-clathrin heavy chain antibodies. immunofluorescence at residues 172– <dig> the hps <dig> protein has a predicted clathrin-binding motif that is conserved in mouse and rat . using site-directed mutagenesis, a gfp-hps3-delcbd construct was created in which the clathrin-binding motif was converted to non-conserved amino acids . the interaction of clathrin-binding proteins with clathrin is a transient phenomena <cit> . to maximize the likelihood of observing the association of gfp-hps <dig> with clathrin by immunofluorescence, a 20°c temperature block was employed. incubation at 20°c for <dig> h was used to block trafficking out of the trans-golgi <cit> and followed by transfer to 37°c for <dig> min to release the temperature block and resume normal trafficking. normal melanocytes expressing wild-type gfp-hps <dig> or gfp-hps3-delcbd, so treated, were then fixed and stained with clathrin heavy chain antibodies. cells expressing gfp-hps <dig> demonstrated partial co-localization with clathrin on one to several small vesicles in the perinuclear area . in a representative experiment, <dig> of <dig> gfp-hps <dig> expressing melanocytes showed this co-localization. in contrast, <dig> of <dig> cells exhibited co-localization of gfp-hps3-delcbd with clathrin . live cell imaging trafficking of acidic vesicles, stained with lysotracker red, was followed in live hps <dig> null fibroblasts expressing either gfp-hps <dig> or gfp-hps3-delcbd . following a 20°c temperature block and transfer to 37°c, acidic vesicles and gfp-hps <dig> clustered together in the perinuclear area . gfp-hps <dig> transiently interacted with acidic vesicles and, in some cases , emerged together with them from the perinuclear area . in contrast, following a 20°c block and transfer to 37°c, gfp-hps3-delcbd was predominantly localized in a punctate pattern in the periphery of the cell; no association of gfp-hps3-delcbd with acidic vesicles was observed . immunoelectron microscopy normal melanocytes were fixed approximately <dig> h after transfection with gfp-hps <dig> expression of the gfp-hps <dig> fusion protein was low at this time, thus minimizing aggregation and other artifacts that can occasionally be observed in overexpressing cells. normal melanocytes transfected with gfp-hps3-delcbd were fixed later because of the very low levels of expression obtained with this construct. no aggregates were observed in the gfp-hps3-delcbd transfected cells. gfp-hps <dig> localized predominantly to small vesicles in the golgi region anti-gfp immunogold particles; table 1) and the vast majority of these particles ) co-localized with clathrin . at high magnification, gfp-hps <dig> labeling was demonstrated on well-defined clathrin-containing vesicles . some of these small clathrin-containing vesicles were found near larger endosomal structures . gfp-hps <dig> labeling was generally less abundant on large endosomal structures than on small vesicles of anti-gfp immunogold particles found on endosomes) and fewer of these particles co-localized with clathrin ;

figure <dig> table 1). the majority of anti-gfp immunogold particles localized to the cytoplasm of gfp-hps3-delcbd expressing cells ), compared with only 7% in gfp-hps <dig> expressing cells . these differences were statistically significant by chi square analysis . double-labeling of anti-clathrin and anti-gfp in normal melanocytes electroporated with gfp-hps3-delcbd . gfp-hps3-delcbd was largely cytoplasmic and distributed throughout the entire cell, from the perinuclear/golgi region to the tips . no co-localization of the two labels was observed. n=nucleus, g=golgi, e=endosomal structure, m=melanosome. bar = <dig> nm no appreciable gfp-hps <dig> or gfp-hps3-delcbd labeling was observed on clearly identifiable golgi stacks . as expected, clathrin labeling appeared much more abundant than gfp labeling in gfp-hps <dig> or gfp-hps3-delcbd expressing melanocytes. similar amounts of gfp labeling per cell were detected in gfp-hps <dig> and gfp-hps3-delcbd expressing cells and no gfp labeling was observed in untransfected cells. not all clathrin-containing membranes were associated with gfp-hps <dig> but the majority of gfp-hps <dig> appeared to be associated with a clathrin-containing membrane. discussion hps <dig> is unusual among hps proteins in that it contains a predicted functional domain, i.e., a clathrin-binding motif . in this report, we describe evidence for the association of hps <dig> with clathrin. we demonstrated that clathrin co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous hps <dig> in normal melanocytes; no clathrin was immunoprecipitated in the absence of hps <dig> i.e., in hps <dig> null cells. the necessity of the clathrin-binding domain in hps <dig> is supported by the partial co-localization of gfp-hps <dig> with clathrin only when this domain is present, as demonstrated by both fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies. furthermore, localization and trafficking of gfp-hps <dig> with acidic vesicles depends upon an intact clathrin-binding domain. the presence of a conserved clathrin-binding motif in hps <dig> combined with the supportive data mentioned above, indicates that hps <dig> most likely binds clathrin directly. we cannot, however, rule out the possibility that hps <dig> interacts indirectly with clathrin. recent studies in mouse <cit> and human <cit> have shown that hps <dig> interacts with hps <dig> and hps <dig> in the bloc- <dig> complex. hence, hps <dig> may function as an essential component of a complex, such as bloc- <dig> in which another member binds clathrin. this seems unlikely, however, since hps <dig> and hps <dig> have no conserved clathrin-binding sequence motifs. in our ultrastructural studies, gfp-hps <dig> was found primarily on small clathrin containing vesicles in the perinuclear/golgi region of normal melanocytes. mutation of the clathrin-binding domain of hps <dig> resulted in a largely cytoplasmic distribution of the fusion protein, suggesting that the clathrin-binding domain is necessary for the correct localization of hps <dig> and that clathrin recruits hps <dig> to small vesicles. interestingly, no gfp-hps <dig> was seen on golgi stacks or on vesicles budding from the tgn, nor was it localized to large endosomal structures or mature melanosomes. in melanocytes from hps <dig> deficient patients, dopa histochemistry detected <dig> nm dopa positive vesicles distributed throughout the cell <cit> . this was in contrast to the situation in normal melanocytes, in which the small dopa-positive vesicles were restricted to the golgi region. a possible explanation is that hps <dig> interacts with the small dopa-positive vesicles via its clathrin-binding domain, escorting them from the golgi region to premelanosomes for delivery of their contents. in such a scenario, additional specialized accessory factors would regulate vesicle targeting, budding and fusion events, clathrin coat assembly and disassembly, and interactions with the cytoskeleton. future investigations should pursue the function of bloc- <dig> with the recognition that one of its components, hps <dig> binds clathrin and may, therefore, bind to vesicles. this understanding allows for hypotheses regarding the roles of hps <dig> and hps <dig> in bloc- <dig> possible roles could include such functions as binding designated cargo, regulating conformational changes of the complex, or tethering proteins or vesicles for interactions with the bloc- <dig> complex as a whole. CONCLUSIONS hps <dig> associates with clathrin, predominantly on small clathrin-containing vesicles in the perinuclear region. this association most likely occurs directly via a functional clathrin-binding domain in hps <dig> and is supported by immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, live cell imaging and immunoelectron microscopy data.",

    "prompt": "Provide an abbreviated summary of this medical case. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND snake venoms comprise a diverse array of toxins that have a variety of biochemical and pharmacological functions and can be conveniently classified as hemotoxins and neurotoxins <cit> . recently, it has been documented that most of the snake toxins were recruited or derived from normal body proteins in the common ancestor of venomous squamates or advanced snakes 100- <dig> million years ago <cit> . associated with the species radiation of advanced snakes in the cenozoic era, a predator-prey arms race led to the explosive appearance of toxic arsenals, and typically, several toxin multigene families were generated by gene duplication, followed by fast diversification <cit> . the birth-and-death model was proposed to explain the emergence of taxon-specific toxin groups <cit> ; i.e., new toxin genes consistently emerged through gene duplication with the divergence of taxa, but some toxin genes got deleted or were degenerated in other lineages. however, due to the low-depth sequencing of toxin transcripts for each species, fast evolution of toxin genes, and lack of genome sequences, the detailed elaboration of snake venom evolution is still unclear. the elapidae family , which has approximately <dig> venomous snakes in <dig> genera, is a monophyletic group among advanced snakes <cit> . several broad radiated lineages have been identified within the elapidae, including the afro-asian cobras, oriental kraits, asian-american corals, and australian and marine snakes, which are well known to be the most toxic snakes in the world. so far, the gene expression profiles of venom glands from four species <cit> have been reported using est sequencing. however, the kraits and cobras , as the most diverse and representative toxic elapids in the old world <cit> , lack genomic and venom est data. in the present study, we prepared cdna libraries from the venom glands of the two representative old world elapid snakes, bungarus multicinctus and naja atra, and sequenced about <dig> clones for each library. we also constructed genomic bacterial artificial chromosome libraries for the two snakes and conducted a screen for venom genes. our results identified many new snake toxins, such as multiple groups of 3ftxs, some novel lectins, and a peculiar natriuretic peptide , and revealed that toxin genes have experienced rapid evolution and gene expansion. RESULTS venom gland cdna libraries and ests we constructed two cdna libraries from the venom gland tissues of b. multicinctus and n. atra, respectively, and randomly selected <dig> and <dig> clones for sequencing. from these clones, we successfully obtained <dig> expressed sequences tags for b. multicinctus and <dig> ests for n. atra. using cap <dig> software with a cutoff of 95% identity <cit> , the b. multicinctus ests were grouped into <dig> clusters , whereas the n. atra ests were grouped into <dig> clusters . using blast for functional annotation, complete lists with putative gene identifications for these est clusters are provided in additional file <dig> most ests could be matched to reported snake toxins . the toxin clusters showed notably high redundancy , in contrast to the low redundancy of non-toxin clusters , indicating that the toxin genes were highly expressed. in this study, we focused on the toxin ests; i.e., <dig> contigs and <dig> singlets in b. multicinctus, and <dig> contigs and <dig> singlets in n. atra . except the dominant 3ftx, we also observed eight less relatively abundant venom families both in b. multicinctus and n. atra: phospholipase a <dig> , c-type lectins, kunitz-type protease inhibitor , l-amino oxidase , nerve growth factor , cysteine-rich secretory protein , and vespryn. however, np, presynaptic bungarotoxin, prothrombin activator , and acetylcholinesterase were only detected in b. multicinctus, while metalloproteinase and cystatin were only found in n. atra. in snake venoms, 3ftx, pla <dig> kunitz, c-type lectins, and metalloproteinase have been reported to be the major multigene toxin families <cit> , and they comprised <dig> % in b. multicinctus and <dig> % in n. atra in our toxin est data. we also identified a peculiar cluster of np precursors with tandem nps. besides, β bungarotoxin is a bungarous-specific toxin, which is a heterodimeric protein complex of phospholipase a <dig> and kunitz peptides covalently linked by one disulphide bridge <cit> . here, we detected <dig> clusters of a chain of β bungarotoxin and <dig> clusters of b chain as a major toxin in b. multicinctus . analysis of toxin genes three-finger toxins 3ftxs are neurotoxins and can bind to very different neurological targets ; some of them also have non-neurotoxic activities <cit> . its family members have a similar structure, with three loops and four conserved disulfide bridges, and contain about 60- <dig> amino acid residues. the ancestral 3ftx was thought to have <dig> cysteines and acquired some amelioration: deletion of the ancestral c <dig> and c <dig> cysteines potentiated alpha-neurotoxic activity and acquired additional newly evolved cysteines <cit> . in <dig> fry grouped <dig> types of 3ftxs from <dig> protein sequences, with a number of \"orphan groups\" of 3ftxs whose functional roles are not yet known <cit> . since then, many other kinds of 3ftxs have been successively detected <cit> . so far, more than five hundred variant 3ftx sequences across the entire advanced snakes have been observed. a birth-and-death mode <cit> and a mechanism of duplication and divergence <cit> , allowing venom snakes to adapt to a variety of prey, were proposed to explain the generation of the 3ftx superfamily. but, the evolutionary relationships of all kinds of 3ftxs are still uncertain, such as the notable alpha neurotoxic clades , which are not monophyletic, based on the phylogenetic tree of 3ftxs constructed by fry <cit> . it is in contrast to previous hypotheses that alpha neurotoxins diverged from a common ancestral gene that separated before the divergence of the elapid sub-family <cit> . the analysis of the b. multicinctus 3ftxs revealed that <dig> clones could be grouped into <dig> contigs and <dig> singlets, and a total of <dig> n. atra clones fell into <dig> contigs and <dig> singlets. we notice that all the contig sequences encoded full-length proteins, except two contigs , which are lacking exon <dig> probably resulting from alternative splicing. since 3ftxs are the dominant toxins in both b. multicinctus and n. atra and show a greater diversity of family members, we classified them basically based on the number of cysteines following the nomenclature of fry <cit> . divergence analysis shows that four of the 3ftx groups had relatively low intra-divergence levels. three of the groups--long chain α-ntx , cytotoxin , and short chain α-ntx --were much more abundant than the rest of the 3ftxs . the other group, orphan gourp ii , have <dig> cysteines and thus could be considered as an ancestral-like 3ftx group. if the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate for one protein-coding sequence is significantly higher than <dig> it indicates a trend toward accelerated evolution. because short coding sequences of 3ftxs have high variation with multiple indels or even frameshifts between different 3ftx toxin groups, this maybe led to inaccurate multiple alignments and ambiguous phylogenetic relationships. so, we only computed dn/ds rates within each of the four major 3ftx groups using paml <cit> . we observed that many dn/ds values are large than <dig> . as an extreme example, we noticed that the two dominating 3ftx contigs occupied <dig> % of all toxin ests in n. atra, and all of the <dig> differences between these two cytotoxin contigs were non-synonymous substitutions, which is significantly different from neutral expectation by fisher's exact test <cit> , suggesting a recently accelerated diversification in this major group of 3ftxs in n. atra. gene note: n represents number of sequences in a gene group. lc represents number of codons in the gene after alignment gaps are removed. s is the tree length, measured asqqqq the number of nucleotide substitutions per codon. ω is the estimate of the dn/ds ratio under the m <dig> m2a or m <dig> model <cit> . the proportions of sites under positive selection are given under the m2a or m <dig> model. the 2Δlnl parameter in the tests of m1a versus m2a or m <dig> versus m <dig> indicating positive selection is marked with *. *: significant at 5% level; **: significant at 1% level. pla <dig> = phospholipase a <dig> bbeta = b chain of β bungarotoxin, kunitz = kunitz-type protease inhibitor, metal = metalloproteinase. we also noticed a special contig, bm <dig> , which was conspicuously different from other contigs and even had a unique signal peptide . based on the phylogenetic analysis, contig bm <dig> might have diverged from other 3ftx genes at an early stage of the origin of snakes . it is possible that bm <dig> has a conserved function and has not diversified into a multi-copy gene family. phospholipase a <dig> and a chain of β bungarotoxin elapidae venom pla <dig> exerts a multiplicity of novel, nonenzymatic activities, including neurotoxic and antiplatelet activity , whereas viperid venom pla <dig> is synovial-type pla <dig> <cit> . the elapid pla <dig> which has <dig> amino acids and <dig> or <dig> disulfide bonds, was thought to be derived independently from nontoxic pancreatic-type pla <dig> <cit> . we identified four clusters of pla2-like ests with intact coding sequence in b. multicinctus and one full-length cluster in n. atra, which covered the major pla <dig> types detected before in b. multicinctus and n. atra. in b. multicinctus, one cluster enclosing <dig> ests showed 100% identity with the pla <dig> sequence of b. multicinctus in genbank . another three clusters in b. multicinctus were similar to the a chain of β bungarotoxins, with a notable substitution at residue <dig> compared with cluster bm <dig> which may be important for the formation of interchain disulfides in β bungarotoxin. based on the gene tree, it is clear that a chain of β bungarotoxin in b. multicinctus quite possibly duplicated from the pla <dig> gene in b. multicinctus. we estimated an average ds value of <dig> between pla <dig> contig bm <dig> and the a chain of β bungarotoxins, which is smaller than the ds value between bm <dig> and the n. atra pla <dig> na <dig> indicating that the a chain of β bungarotoxin might have derived from pla <dig> after the divergence of bungarus and naja. kunitz-type protease inhibitor and b chain of β bungarotoxin kunitz belongs to the superfamily of bovine pancreatic trypsin-like inhibitors , with the ancestral function of inhibiting a diverse array of serine proteases and with a peptide chain of around <dig> amino acid residues and <dig> disulfide bonds <cit> . it evolved the toxin ability to inhibit various physiological processes, such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, host defense, and action potential transduction. in elapid venoms, besides the common kunitz with trypsin or chymotrypsin inhibitor activity, the dendrotoxins in dendroaspis have presynaptic neurotoxicity <cit> , and the b chain of β bungarotoxin is thought to act as an affinity probe to guide the a chain to its target <cit> . in b. multicinctus, four clusters of the b chain of a β bungarotoxin-like sequence and one partial kunitz-type protease inhibitor-like cluster were obtained. in n. atra, only one singlet of a kunitz-type protease inhibitor-like est was detected. to understand the evolutionary relationship of the kunitz-type protease inhibitor and b chain of β bungarotoxin, we constructed a phylogenetic tree . we also obtained an average ~ <dig> ds value between the kunitz-type protease inhibitor and b chain of β bungarotoxin. compared with the similar ds value of <dig> between pla <dig> contig bm <dig> and a chain of β bungarotoxin, we propose that the a chain and b chain of β bungarotoxin evolved separately from pla <dig> and kuntiz around the same time as the common ancestor of bungarus. c-type lectin c-type lectins or c-type lectin-like proteins are ubiquitous components of animal venoms and contain distinct diversified subgroups, including true lectins, coagulant proteins, platelet aggregation agonists, and platelet aggregation antagonists <cit> . the elapid c-type lectins are arranged inside the true lectins group, except one m. corallinus c-type lectin <cit> . the true lectins cause aggregation of erythrocytes in a dose-dependent manner, which are normally composed of two covalently linked identical subunits, each consisting of 135- <dig> amino acids <cit> . here, <dig> c-type lectins-like ests were grouped into <dig> clusters in b. multicinctus, while only one contig from <dig> ests was identified in n. atra. interestingly, all of these clones do not match the previously sequenced c-type lectins in b. multicinctus and n. atra. phylogenetic analysis revealed that a cluster of three contigs that we sequenced were grouped separately from all of the known bungarus lectins, indicating that this is a novel cluster that diverged from the main group . metalloproteinase metalloproteinase is the dominant component in viperid venoms, which exerts anticoagulant or coagulant effects and results in a severe bleeding by interfering with blood coagulation and hemostatic plug formation or by degrading the basement membrane or extracellular matrix components of the victims <cit> . but, few metalloproteinases are detected in elapids <cit> , which produce long cdna products . here, three partial singlet ests in n. atra represented two kinds of metalloproteinase isoforms, which were respectively similar to ef <dig> in n. atra and ay <dig> in naja mossambica as p-iii type metalloproteinases. natriuretic peptide the np family functions to control natriuresis, diuresis, blood pressure, homeostasis, and inhibition of aldosterone secretion in all vertebrates or is used by snakes to interrupt these physiological processes of preys <cit> and thus has attracted attention as ideal candidates of hypotensive and vasodilator agents. it has a conserved ring structure, consisting of <dig> amino acids, with extensions of a few amino acids in the two termini. four major members of the np family have been indentified in vertebrates--atrial np , b-type np , c-type np , and ventricular np --and structurally, cnp lacks the c-terminal tail, whereas other nps have both tails <cit> . all of the snake venom nps seem to have originated from a common ancestral venom, cnp, and a complete snake cnp pro-peptide is constituted by a signal peptide, a linker, a flexible n-terminal extension , and a mature peptide . nevertheless, snake nps have recruited some new segments, such as several bradykinin-potentiating peptides , located in the np precursor in the viperidae family, whereas an alterable c-terminal extension was acquired in the elapidae family, which may result in novel physiological actions <cit> . here, we detected one contig only in b. multicinctus, and this transcript had a region containing two tandem cnp- <dig> repeats. we noticed that this pair of tandem duplicates had different putative mature peptides but had almost identical n-terminal extensions , with statistically significant region-biased mutations by fisher's exact test, which may represent a functional differentiation between the two nps. two possible evolutionary scenarios can explain this pattern: a) this is an old duplicate event, but the n-terminal extensions have a recent conversion or may be under strong functional constraint; and b) this is a young duplicate event, and the putative mature peptides evolved very fast. however, based on the alignment of np sequences in elapidae venoms , we noticed that bm <dig> and another unusual np had a common repeated region <cit> . we also found that the closest sequence of bm <dig> was the dnp in green mamba snake , which has attracted attention abroad for its novel long c-terminal extension <cit> , and figure 3b shows that the c-terminal extension of dnp is homologous with the common repeated region. based on these clues, we propose that the duplicate event may have occurred in the ancestor of bungarus, dendroaspis, and micrurus. bm <dig> the np precursor in b. multicinctus , is aligned to other elapid np sequences. a repeated region is shown between dashed bars, and the predicted regions of signal peptide and core ring are indicated above the alignment. other toxins in the cdna libraries, except for the major multigene toxin families, there were some other toxins that were widely found in snake venoms but that only constituted a small part of the total ests in a species. most of these toxins had been recruited into the venom system before the last common ancestor of elapid and viperid snakes with assistant toxic functions or unknown functions, such as crisp, ngf, lao, cystatin, and acetylcholinesterase <cit> . besides, vespryn and prothrombin activator were only found in that elapid species so far <cit> . in this study, we obtained many full or partial novel sequences of these less abundant toxins: one cluster in b. multicinctus and three clusters in n. atra coding for crisp, one cluster in b. multicinctus and one cluster in n. atra coding for ngf, one cluster in b. multicinctus and one cluster in n. atra coding for lao, three clusters in b. multicinctus and one cluster in n. atra coding for vespryn, one cluster coding for cystatin, and one cluster coding for acetylcholinesterase in n. atra. comparison of the major venom components among elapid snakes previously several other transcriptomes of the elapid venom gland had been reported, such as marine snakes , australian snake , and coral snake <cit> . however, besides 3ftxs, pla <dig> is also another major venom component in these species. we also noticed that the major types, 3ftxs, are very different. the major 3ftx types from the marine and australian snakes are long chain α-ntx and short chain α-ntx, whereas micrurus corallines mainly contains orphan gourp xii and some unknown groups of 3ftxs. in contrast, the major components of b. multicinctus venom transcriptome are 3ftxs and recently originated β bungarotoxin while the n. atra venom transcriptome mainly contains cytotoxin and short chain α-ntx groups of 3ftx. other less abundant toxins were not observed in the transcriptomes of the marine and australian snakes, maybe due to the small number of sequenced clones. besides transcripts, some studies also described peptide sequences for some elapid snake toxins. a study characterizing venom proteins of n. atra identified <dig> protein segments or peptides <cit> , 74% of which belonged to 3ftxs and 11% were pla <dig> in another study of naja kaouthia venom proteomics <cit> , <dig> venom proteins segments or peptides were identified, most of which were covered by our est sequence, except the cobra venom factors. two studies on coral snakes identified <dig> and <dig> toxin proteins or peptides, respectively <cit> , 3ftx and pla <dig> proteins were also the major toxin components. so, the major toxins are basically consistent with our results observed in the n. atra venom gland transcriptome while bungarus has quite different components. however, it seems the pla <dig> transcripts have higher expression efficiency, considering that the pla <dig> ests only comprise <dig> % of our toxin ests in n. atra while pla <dig> peptides were observed to compose of a considerable amount in the n. atra venom <cit> . analyses on the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates for the protein-coding ests of all toxin genes it has been known that the 3ftx and pla <dig> toxin multigene families have been subjected to positive darwinian selection <cit> , but whether this has happened in the less abundant toxins is still unknown. we used the maximum likelihood model to estimate the dn/ds ratios of all kinds of toxins in elapid snake venoms. the representative sequences used here were from our est data or downloaded from the genbank database . except for orphan group ii of 3ftxs in b. multicinctus, almost all of the toxins had some sites that showed evidence of positive selection dn/ds ratios, and the dn/ds ratios for these sites ranged from <dig> to <dig> . these results suggest that most toxin genes in elapid venoms might have been subjected to strong pressure of prey species shifts or arsenal competition, leading to the accelerated innovation of antigenic epitopes in toxins. bac library construction and sequencing of 3ftx genes in order to understand the gene structure of toxin genes, two independent bac libraries containing <dig> and <dig> clones, with average inserted genomic segments of <dig> and <dig> kb respectively, were constructed and arrayed into 384-well microtiter plates. examples of <dig> digested clones are presented in additional file 2: figure s <dig> we estimated that the percentage of clones without inserts was about 10%. based on the snake's haploid genome size of <dig> pg for bungarus fasciatus and <dig> pg for naja haje <cit> , we estimated the genome coverage of the libraries to be around <dig> × for b. multicinctus and <dig> × for n. atra. these coverages theoretically provide <dig> % and <dig> % probability of obtaining any unique sequence in the b. multicinctus and n. atra bac libraries, respectively, assuming random cloning <cit> . we used 3ftx, pla <dig> kunitz, or np toxin probes to screen the two bac libraries and identified <dig> positive bac clones for b. multicinctus and <dig> for n. atra. the screening results are listed in table <dig> unfortunately, we did not find positive pla <dig> clones for n. atra. in addition, we identified positive np bac clones in n. atra, but we did not observe ests from its cdna library. in order to understand evolution patterns in the 3ftx super-family, we tried to subclone and sequence the 3ftx toxin genes. there were <dig> bac clones showing 3ftx-probe positivity in this study. as the major toxin in elapid venoms, the structure and organization of 3ftx toxin genes have clearly been found to consist of three exons and two introns in a region of about <dig> kb <cit> . based on the results of ecor i digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis separation, most of the <dig> bac clones had multiple 3ftx toxin gene fragments, whose sizes were from <dig> kb to <dig> kb . considering that the 3ftx toxin genes are about <dig> kb long and seldom contain ecor i sites, these multiple 3ftx toxin gene fragments, located in the same bac clone, are very likely to be tandem duplicates. excluding some redundant bac clones with the same 3ftx toxin gene restriction fragments, we obtained <dig> rflp-unique 3ftx toxin bac clones, indicating there are at least <dig> and <dig> segmental duplicate areas of 3ftx toxin genes, respectively, in b. multicinctus and n. atra. because of the existence of tandem duplicates, it is hard to sequence these clones. finally, we got <dig> and <dig> complete or partial 3ftx toxin gene sequences by constructing subcloning libraries and genomic walking, respectively, for b. multicinctus and n. atra. the 3ftx toxin gene sequences that were derived from the same bac clone were defined as putative tandem duplicates. there are <dig> putative tandem duplicates in b. multicinctus and <dig> in n. atra. the nucleotide substitution rate per site in the non-coding regions between the tandem duplicates is shown in table <dig> we noticed that most of the potential tandem duplicates had low kn values , indicating that most duplication events happened recently. it also suggests that fast 3ftx gene expansion is still ongoing in the two elapids. based on the best blast hits to the genbank database and our est data, all of the 3ftx toxin genes were classified and annotated . about 65% of the gene sequences showed lower than 95% identity with 3ftx toxin gene sequences from the genbank database, indicating that most of the 3ftx toxin genes that we sequenced are novel sequences . parts of the 3ftx genes that we sequenced, especially a big group that looked similar to orphan group ii, could not match any ests from the two cdna libraries, indicating that a large number of lower-expression 3ftx toxin genes were not detected in previous studies. because the coding sequences of 3ftx genes are short and too diversified, it is difficult to construct an accurate phylogenetic relationship for all these diverse subgroups of 3ftx. so, we tried to use only the intron sequences for genic phylogenetic analyses, especially using intron ii, which has a stable length of about <dig> bp <cit> . but, the 3ftx gene tree still confuses us with multiple radiated sub-families, just like the phylogenetic relationship of the 3ftx constructed by fry <cit> . taking α-ntx for example, we observed two monophyletic lineages of short chain α-ntx from n. atra and two monophyletic lineages of long chain α-ntx, respectively, from b. multicinctus and n. atra, which indicates that multiple groups of α-ntx separated before the divergence of bungarus and naja. considering that the long chain α-ntx originated mainly by one splicing site shifting event from short chain α-ntx <cit> and that both the short and long chain α-ntx coexist in some australian and marine snakes, such as austrelaps labialis <cit> , lapemis curtus <cit> , and laticauda semifasciata <cit> , the hypotheses that α-ntx diverged from a common ancestor seems reasonable. so, it is very likely that these broad radiated groups of 3ftx appeared right before the explosive speciation of major elapid subfamilies in the mid-oligocene <cit> . in brief, our data suggest that 3ftx genes probably experienced family explosion and thereby generated the major groups before the species radiation of elapidae subfamilies. after that, by massive duplication, perhaps mainly by tandem duplication, the 3ftx gene family acquired numerous new members and became the most abundant toxin family in the two elapid venoms. CONCLUSIONS both b. multicinctus and n. atra venoms are very toxic, respectively, with ld <dig> of <dig> mg/kg and <dig> mg/kg when injected subcutaneously , and they belong to two closely related genera <cit> . however, the major components of the b. multicinctus venom transcriptome are neurotoxins, including long chain α-ntx and β bungarotoxin, whereas the n. atra venom transcriptome mainly has cytotoxicity and a little bit of neurotoxicity from short chain α-ntx. in this study, we present the toxin profiles of b. multicinctus and n. atra by sequencing their venom gland transcriptomes. then, the bac libraries for these two elapids were constructed, and <dig> bacs containing 3ftx genes were partially sequenced. the data revealed that tandem duplications contributed the majority of the expansions of toxin multigene families in the two elapids. we detected positive selection in every toxin subfamily and found that not only the multigene toxin families but also the less abundant toxins were under rapid adaptive evolution.",

consists of four major clades, a western, a northwestern, a northern clade, and the clade of l. mustelinus. l. mustelinus branched off first, followed by the western clade that consisted of irs <dig> and the individuals found in kirindy . the northern clade consisted of irs iv, v, vi and vii , and the northwestern clade of irs i, ii and iii . all so far recognized species formed distinct terminal clades with moderate to large branch lengths. branch lengths among irs i, ii and iii in the northwestern clade were in the same scale as these between l. ankaranensis and l. dorsalis. the absolute pairwise distances within an irs ranged from zero to seven characters . the absolute pairwise distances among irss and mantadia ) varied from <dig> to <dig> characters. the largest absolute pairwise distance existed between l. aeeclis and l. mustelinus. the smallest absolute pairwise distance among irss existed between irs v and irs vi, both of them were previously supposed to give home to l. dorsalis. the relative genetic distance between these two irss can be defined as intermediate between the intra-irs differences and the interspecific differences . this level of differentiation could indicate the presence of two subspecies of l. dorsalis. in accordance with the deep phylogenetic splits in the lepilemur tree among the western, northwestern, and northern clade, absolute pairwise distances were always largest when crossing borders among neighbouring biogeographic zones . when examining the absolute pairwise distances among the irss within the northwestern clade, they were the same size or even larger than between l. dorsalis and l. ankaranensis, which are accepted species . additional files <dig> <dig> <dig> show the molecular diagnostic sites for each terminal clade in each of the three genes. recognized species had total number of one to <dig> sites that allowed to identify them unmistakably. the two terminal clades containing the individuals of irs ii and iii had a total of eleven and seven diagnostic sites, respectively. the absolute pairwise distances as well as the analysis of the diagnostic sites indicate the presence of two new lepilemur species in northwestern madagascar, one in irs ii and one in irs iii. consequently, the geographic range of l. edwardsi is much smaller than previously assumed, and limited exclusively to irs i. by mapping each of these species with respect to their geographical setting , it can be concluded that all large rivers act as genetic barriers in this genus . morphometry the means and standard deviations of all morphometric variables for the nine phylogenetically defined species are provided in table <dig> all variables showed significant differences for species in the anova. post-hoc tests revealed that ear length and intraorbital distance was significantly different in <dig> of the <dig> possible pairs of species and thereby the two most distinct variables, followed by snout length , weight , head width and lower leg length , tail circumference , 3rd toe length , interorbital distance and hind foot length and tail length . six variables showed tendencies in one to two possible pairs of species. the post-hoc tests revealed significant differences between the northwestern and northern clade and between the northern clade and l. mustelinus. moreover, it could distinguish between all neighbouring species , except between l. aeeclis from the western clade and l. edwardsi from the northwestern clade . two asterisks indicate significant differences and one asterisk indicate a statistical trend between the neighbouring species/columns. the discriminant function analysis used five variables for model calculation, ear length, snout length, lower leg length, interorbital distance and intraorbital distance. two functions were computed explaining a significant part of the morphometric variability between the six established and two proposed species = <dig> ; p < <dig> ). table <dig> shows the classification matrix, with correct classification in <dig> % of the cross-validated cases. the differences between the classification accuracy of each species ranged from 60% to 100%. the individuals of l. aeeclis, l. sp. nova in irs iii and l. mustelinus were correctly classified in 100% of the cases. the individuals of l. sp. nova in irs ii and l. ankaranensis were correctly classified in 80%, and the individuals of l. edwardsi, l. sahamalazensis and l. dorsalis had the smallest percentage of correct classifications . all misclassifications occurred within each major clade, indicating again cryptic speciation within the genus lepilemur. discussion revised phylogeny of the genus lepilemur molecular methods, such as dna sequencing provide powerful tools to understand diversity and phylogeny <cit> . this could be confirmed by our study in sportive lemurs. the phylogenetic trees distinguished all previously described species. moreover, it provided evidence for two previously unknown species in northwestern madagascar. the absolute pairwise distances between all species were in the range of those observed in other lemur genera such as mirza <cit> , microcebus <cit> , hapalemur <cit> and propithecus <cit> . the two new taxa occurred in a single irs each. their phylogenetic position in the tree, the genetic distances and the number of diagnostic sites, suggest a separation at the species level. similar conclusions were drawn with comparable approaches in other taxa <cit> . besides the molecular evidence, the discriminant function analysis of the morphometric data further supported the species status of the two new lepilemur taxa in northwestern madagascar. between 80% and 100% of the animals were correctly classified into their irs of origin. the anova of the morphometric data detected significant differences between the northwestern and northern clade and between the northern clade and l. mustelinus. moreover, it could differentiate between the neighbouring species within the northwestern and northern clade, but it could not distinguish between l. edwardsi and l. aeeclis that are geographically separated by the river betsiboka. the differentiation between the northwestern and northern clade, and between the northern clade and l. mustelinus is stronger than between the species within these major clades. although the lack of differentiation between the western and northwestern clade may also partly be due to a sample size effect, it may also suggest cryptic speciation events in the genus lepilemur not only within major clades as it is known in other taxa <cit> , but also between major clades. the revised phylogeny of the genus lepilemur is based on the combination of molecular differences and morphometric traits. diagnostic sites are also routinely used in dna barcoding, which is becoming an increasingly important tool in species identification <cit> . although dna barcoding requires a large and nearly complete database of sequences to which individuals can be compared <cit> , the diagnostic sites we identified can be seen as first step towards such a database in lepilemur.

CONCLUSIONS our results showed that all species, except for l. mustelinus from the east, grouped in three major clades . taking into account the species diversity within each major clade, however, we can define seven biogeographic zones in northern and northwestern madagascar. when compared to the predictions derived from the \"martin model\" and the \"wilmé model\", we find several inconsistencies to our data. the \"martin model\" defined four biogeographic zones from western to northern madagascar . they corresponded well to the three deep phylogenetic splits, that gave rise to the western, northwestern and northern clade in our study. however, the species diversity within each major clade could not be explained by this model. the \"wilmé model\" defined six biogeographic zones from western to northern madagascar . this model may also explain the deep splits between the three major clades, but it proposed two more splits. one between irs v and vi, divided by the sambirano river. this split could be confirmed by our study, although it seems not to be a species barrier for sportive lemurs. the level of absolute pairwise distances is intermediate and may rather suggest a variation on a subspecies level. very recently however, rabarivola et al. proposed species status for the individuals in irs v based on cytogenetics <cit> . they collected samples in irs v at a locality further north of mahilaka and the number of chromosomes differed between individuals from irs v and the neighbouring lepilemur sahamalazensis and lepilemur dorsalis . the second additional split indicated by the \"wilmé model\" is that between zone <dig> and <dig> this split could not be confirmed by our study, since all individuals found in irs vii clustered together and belonged to the species l. ankaranensis. one major discrepancy exists between our findings and the \"wilmé model\". the \"wilmé model\" predicts one centre of endemism in northwestern madagascar , which should correspond to one lepilemur species in that area. our study provided evidence, however, for three species of sportive lemurs between the betsiboka and maevarano river, each restricted to one of the three irss. thus, we showed that each irs is represented as a separate terminal clade in the phylogenetic trees, building distinct phylogenetic units. at least six of the seven large rivers act as species barriers for lepilemur. therefore, we propose a new model, the \"large river model\" to explain the biogeography of this larger-sized nocturnal lemur genus. large rivers acted as insurmountable barriers for gene flow, leading to cryptic speciation within larger biogeographic units. except for irss v and vi, the genetic distances among all irss reach species level. the deep splits between the major clades may indicate initial colonization events, with the betsiboka and maevarano river playing a major role in long-term and continuous isolation of western, northwestern and northern madagascar. the splits within each major clade however, indicate younger cryptic speciation events. populations, initially belonging to one founder species, entered the irss i-iii and vi-vii respectively, and were subsequently separated from each other by the rivers mahajamba and sofia, and the andranomalaza, respectively. quaternary paleoclimatic variation may have played another important role in shaping biogeography and speciation events on madagascar. the climate during periods of glaciation was cooler and drier than today <cit> . rivers with year-round water course could have acted as retreats/refugia in times of aridification. all seven large rivers in northwestern and northern madagascar should have belonged to this category, since the genetic isolation of the irss would otherwise not have persisted over time and signs of repeated introgression should be detectable. subsequent recolonization of the irss should thereby have originated from small and isolated refugia, which further promoted genetic differentiation between the irss. in conclusion, we presented evidence for an unexpected species diversity of sportive lemurs in northwestern and northern madagascar. current biogeographic models were not sufficient to explain the underlying processes of speciation. we therefore suggest a new model of biogeographical zonation, the \"large river model\". in this model, biogeographic zones are separated and maintained over time by all large rivers with permanent water bodies that may have provided retreat zones during periods of aridification and may have harboured founder populations for subsequent recolonization. the importance of large rivers as biogeographic barriers was previously emphazized for mouse lemurs <cit> , but also for neotropical primates <cit> . further studies are now needed to test the relevance of this model for other terrestrial taxa, such as the insectivores, rodents, or other lemurs.",

physics and biology to social sciences and psychology. in data intensive fields of biology, it is important to identify groups or clusters of data showing similar behavior. many methods for clustering have been developed, which fall into two general categories: heuristic algorithms and model based analyses. in heuristic algorithms clustering is obtained either by optimizing a certain target function or iteratively agglomerating nodes to form bottom-up trees. examples of these approaches include: k-means <cit> and k-median <cit> clustering, fuzzy k-means clustering <cit> , affinity propagation <cit> , spectral clustering <cit> , qt clustering <cit> and density contour clustering <cit> . in contrast to heuristic methods, model-based clustering methods make inferences based on probabilistic assumptions about the data distribution. gaussian or modified gaussian mixture models <cit> use the expectation-maximization algorithm <cit> to find the parameters of the distributions that are fitted to the data. then bayesian information criterion <cit> , akaike information criterion <cit> , integrated completed likelihood <cit> or other criterion is used to select the number of clusters. flow cytometry is a commonly used technique to measure the levels of expression of multiple markers, such as specific proteins, in millions of cells. fcm data is typically analyzed by an attempt at visual selection of similar groups of data in <dig> dimensional projections, a process referred to as gating. the visual identification of similar groups of data points, referred to in fcm as manual gating, is error-prone, non-reproducible, non-standardized, difficult to apply to more than two dimensions, and manpower-intensive, making it a limiting aspect of the technology <cit> . despite its widespread use, fcm lacks a fast and reliable method for automated analysis to parallel its high-throughput data-generation. the development of a reliable, heuristic clustering approach suitable for large datasets would significantly improve the value of fcm experiments and would have widespread application to other data-intensive biological clustering problems. automated fcm gating attempts using heuristic methods, such as k-means and fuzzy k-means <cit> do not provide stable results. different initial values for the algorithm, i.e. initial locations of the cluster centers, typically result in different clustering results. often, with a poor set of initial values, the minimization of the target function falls into a local minimum and gives an undesirable clustering result. furthermore, these methods work best with spherical or hyperspherical shaped clusters, a distribution often not observed in fcm datasets. several other useful clustering algorithms based on pairwise comparisons, including linkage or pearson coefficients method <cit> and the affinity propagation method <cit> , are computationally too expensive to be used for fcm because the size of the pairwise distance matrix increases on the order of n <dig> with the number of points. classification and regression trees <cit> , artificial neural networks <cit> and support vector machines <cit> have also been used in the context of fcm analyses <cit> , but these supervised approaches require training data, which may not be available and may perform unreliably if the features of the experimental data diverge from the training set. model-based approaches are slow, need user involvement and require assumptions about cluster distributions that limit their general utility <cit> . a major problem of all practical approaches for unsupervised fcm cluster analysis remains the determination of the number of clusters. the use of bic, aic, icl or other criterion can make the determination of cluster number unreliable . to overcome these limitations of the above approaches, we have developed a new density contour clustering method that is particularly suitable for fcm data. in the early 1960's boyell and ruston <cit> , working on methods for storing topological data in a manner allowing efficient reconstruction, recognized that contour lines can be represented as a tree structure. this insight led to the idea of density contour clustering by finding the largest cross section of each histogram peak <cit> . jang and hendry <cit> used a density contour method for clustering galaxies, that in principle is most similar to our method. their method is a modification of a method proposed by cuveas et al. <cit> . we have developed a new, fast density contour clustering method suitable for large, multi-dimensional datasets that will be compared with jang and hendry's method in additional file <dig> the method is unbiased for cluster shape and does not require global optimization of a multi-variable target function like other commonly used clustering methods do. the algorithm run time increases on the order of n. according to the tests on manually gated and simulated data the method provides correct clustering with correct number of clusters. the misty mountain algorithm can be understood as the computational analogy of an airplane view of histogram terrain that is initially completely immersed in misty clouds. the mist is steadily removed from the top down by the sun, progressively uncovering clusters as peaks that pierce the mist. eventually the merging points of two peaks, the highest saddle, is revealed. from there two peaks form one instead of two holes in the mist. as the level of the mist decreases, more and more summits and saddles are revealed and evaluated to determine the number of statistically distinct peaks and their extent. RESULTS misty mountain algorithm the approach is briefly described here and more extensively in methods. the multi-dimensional data is first processed to generate a histogram containing an optimal number of bins by using knuth's data-based optimization criterion <cit> . then cross sections of the histogram are created. the algorithm finds the largest cross section of each statistically significant histogram peak. the data points belonging to these largest cross sections define the clusters of the data set. to illustrate the method, we generated a simulated two-dimensional <dig> fcm dataset with the respective histogram having four peaks . seven representative locations of the histogram intersection with a lowering plane are shown . each cross section shows group or aggregate of those bins where the bin content is higher than the actual level of the cross section. with decreasing level, the number and size of the bin aggregates increase . then at the level of the highest saddle two bin aggregates coalesce . at one level higher we have the largest, still separated bin aggregates . the data points belonging to these two largest bin aggregates define the first two clusters of the cluster analysis. the blue colored aggregate in figure 1i is shown just before coalescing with the gray colored aggregate. the data points belonging to this aggregate define the third cluster of the analysis. the cross section of the red peak is still separated and largest at frequency = <dig> . the data belonging to the respective bin aggregate define the fourth cluster. to realize the steps described above computationally, the algorithm uses a percolation theory based procedure <cit> by labeling different bin aggregates of a histogram cross section by different integers. then the algorithm comparatively analyzes pairs of consecutive cross sections to recognize coalescing bin aggregates. assigning clusters to the coalescing bin aggregates requires the lp1-ls and lp2-ls relative heights of the two peaks that fuse both be statistically significantly greater than random fluctuations . lp <dig> lp <dig> and ls are the heights of the fusing first and second peak and the saddle between them, respectively. in the sample data, the algorithm assigned points to four clusters, requiring <dig> seconds cpu time on a standard laptop pc. the characteristic properties of the assigned clusters such as cluster size and reliability of the assignation are shown in table <dig> these clusters contain 85% of all the <dig> data points. misty mountain is a tight clustering method in that it does not force all points into clusters <cit> . lp: height of the peak. ls: height of the highest saddle next to the peak. c: number of data points in the cluster. f: measure of separateness of the peak from nearby peak. the parameter estimates the reliability that an element of the cluster belongs to the respective population. testing misty mountain algorithm we analyzed a flow cytometry dataset containing <dig> points representing the side scattering and forward scattering measurements obtained from u <dig> macrophage cells . an expert in flow cytometry would interpret the large oval group as representing intact cells and would form a gate to separate these cells for further analysis from cellular debris. we first used k-median <cit> and spectral clustering <cit> algorithms. for k-median clustering we used simulated annealing <cit> to find the global minimum of the target function, i.e. to find a stable solution of the clustering problem. both of these conventional clustering methods gave similar erroneous results . we next used the misty mountain algorithm to cluster these data. the respective optimal histogram contained <dig> × <dig> bins and there were <dig> points in the most populated bin. thus during the analysis, cross sections of the histogram were created at <dig> levels. the elapsed cpu time of the cluster analysis was <dig> sec. the result of the cluster analysis is shown in figure 2c. these clusters contain <dig> % of all the data points, which are assigned at high confidence . we next compared misty mountain with other state of the art flow cytometry automated gating algorthims using a variety of datasets . the accuracy of these various algorithms was determined using expert manual gating to generate gold standards with <dig> dimensional and <dig> dimensional experimental datasets as well simulated <dig> dimensional and <dig> dimensional datasets having known cluster numbers. algorithm run time was compared using these datasets as well as additional high dimensional experimental datasets for which a gold standard for accuracy was not generated. the accuracy of misty mountain was superior to that of all other methods tested. the speed of misty mountain was comparable to that of flowjo and orders of magnitude faster than other state of the art published methods. extensive benchmarking suggests that misty mountain provides a significant improvement over the performance of other available methods. a optimal cluster number: 12 b optimal cluster number: 24 a*optimal cluster number: 15 b*optimal

performance of the misty mountain algorithm with a complex flow cytometry dataset consisting varying levels of two fluorophores, apc-cy7-a and pacific blue-a, in <dig> u <dig> cells is shown in figure <dig> the dataset in figure 3a was generated for a barcoding experiment <cit> in which different groups of cells were labeled with different concentrations of each fluorophore. the respective optimal histogram that was analyzed contained <dig> × <dig> bins. the most populated bin contained <dig> data points. thus during the analysis, <dig> cross sections of the histogram were created. the elapsed cpu time of the cluster analysis was <dig> sec. the results of the cluster analysis are shown in figure 3b. the analysis identified <dig> large clusters where the reliability of the cluster elements was from <dig> - <dig> , and <dig> small clusters with about <dig> reliability. these clusters contained 87% of all the data points. the characteristic properties of the assigned clusters are listed in table in additional file <dig> the last cluster in the table is a very small one and it is considered as noise . in additional files <dig> and <dig> the analysis of an even more complex 3d barcoding experiment is shown. as another example we analyzed one of the graft-versus-host disease data sets. these 4d data sets have been made available <cit> and used in a few flow cytometry analysis publications already <cit> . the individual data files are available at: http://www.ficcs.org/data/data-files/. in our current example we used a data set from gvhd <dig> iso, folder e# <dig> h <dig> two dimensional projections of the data and the result of the clustering are shown in figure <dig> and <dig> respectively. this data set is an example for overlapping populations. misty mountain algorithm assigned <dig> clusters to the 4d gvhd data set within <dig> sec. the analyzed histogram of the simulated data contained <dig> bins. since the populations are severely overlapping the assigned clusters contain only 29% of all the data points. table <dig> lists the characteristics of the clusters assigned by misty mountain. the low f values in table <dig> show that the histogram peaks belonging to cluster <dig> <dig> and <dig> are seriously overlapping with nearby peak. in each of these cases misty mountain assigns cluster to a histogram cross section that is close to the top of the respective peak and thus the number of histogram bins assigned to these seriously overlapping clusters is low. the above two data sets are also analyzed by state of the art clustering methods in additional file <dig> and compared with the results of misty mountain clustering. bin #: number of histogram bins containing the points of a cluster we also compared the performance of the various gating algorithms using a dataset from 4d bone-marrow derived mouse stromal cells stained with antibodies for cd <dig> gr <dig> mac <dig> and cd <dig> two experts manually gated this experiment obtaining identical results. misty mountain gave results identical to that of the experts, unlike the other automated gating methods . in order to test algorithm performance we used a variety of other experimental and simulated data sets with biologically interesting populations such as low density, overlapping and non-convex populations. comparisons were made using simulated <dig> dimensional and <dig> dimensional data and additional experiments with <dig> dimensional and <dig> dimensional data . these results all strongly support the improved accuracy and utility of the misty mountain algorithm relative to other state of the art methods. studies were done to evaluate the time complexity of the misty mountain algorithm. these simulations revealed that at fixed bin number the overall run time for the composite steps of the algorithm increases linearly by the number of data points. also an increase in the run time was detected with increasing dimensionality of the data space . the number of clusters did not alter the computation time . the misty mountain algorithm can be applied to analyze other than fcm data when the data set is large enough to construct an adequate histogram. for example in astrophysics it can be used for unsupervised recognition of star/galaxy clusters, or in social sciences to analyze questionnaires and identify groups with common interests/opinions. implementation the implementation, instruction and the input data files of all the examples analyzed in this study are available in additional files <dig> <dig> and <dig> pca- misty mountain algorithm for high dimensional data the current version of the misty mountain algorithm software uses direct analysis for data having up to <dig> dimensions. some flow cytometry datasets may have up to twelve or even more dimensions. one can set the critical dimension higher than <dig> however the run time, the number of data points needed for an adequate histogram and the memory requirement for storing the histogram increases super linearly with increasing dimension. as another option, we have combined the misty mountain algorithm with principal component analysis <cit> . in order to analyze higher than <dig> dimensional data, we use pca to project the high dimensional data into a <dig> dimensional subspace. the subspace is spanned by <dig> eigenvectors belonging to the <dig> largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data. then misty mountain analysis is performed on the projected data. finally the points of the assigned clusters are back-projected into their original position in the data space. this procedure is demonstrated on a simulated <dig> dimensional data set containing points that distributed as the sum of <dig> distorted-gaussians. the parameters of the distorted-gaussians are listed in the table in additional file <dig> by using pca, the simulated data are projected into the 5d subspace where misty mountain clustering is performed. the points of the assigned <dig> clusters are back-projected to their original position in the 10d data space. table in additional file <dig> lists the center coordinates of the assigned clusters. as a demonstration of correct clustering these cluster centers are very close to the means of the respective distorted-gaussians. it is important to note that the projection of the data into the 5d subspace may bring some of the otherwise separated histogram peaks so close to each other that the number of clusters assigned by the misty mountain algorithm becomes less than the true value. this happens with higher frequency when the data histogram contains many, broad peaks. finally it is important to note that the optimal choice for the critical dimension depends on the actual number of the data points, i.e. one should be able to create an adequate histogram from the data at the critical dimension. advantages and limitations of misty mountain algorithm advantages: 1) misty mountain algorithm is unbiased for cluster shape. 2) it is robust to noise, 3) it is fast, 4) it is unsupervised. it does not need estimation for cluster number. 5) the computation time linearly increases with the number of data points limitations: 1) misty mountain algorithm identifies two closely situated populations as one when the respective histogram has only one peak 2) it identifies two populations as one when lp-ls is comparable with the standard deviation of lp-ls. 3) the computation time, the number of data points needed for an adequate histogram and the memory requirement for the histogram super linearly increase with the dimension of the data space misty mountain provides a useful, general solution for multidimensional clustering problems. it can be easily adapted to address diverse large dataset clustering problems in computational biology. it is particularly suitable for automated gating of fcm and should improve the ability to interpret experimental data in this field. CONCLUSIONS in biology, measurements on a single object are frequently represented by a point in a multi-dimensional space where the coordinates of the point refer to the measured values. with the advent of high-throughput assays, these experiments can generate datasets comprising millions of points. clusters of points may be thought of as regions of high density separated from other such regions of low density. we describe a fast algorithm that automatically identifies clusters of data points showing similar values. the three major steps of the algorithm are: i) the multi-dimensional data is first processed to generate a histogram containing an optimal number of bins. ii) the cross sections of the histogram are created. iii) the algorithm finds the largest cross section of each statistically significant histogram peak. the data points belonging to these largest cross sections define the clusters of our data set. while the idea of clustering by using a density histogram is old, the present implementation results in particularly fast clustering that is useful for data-intensive computational biology applications. misty mountain clusters <dig> data points in 2d data space in about <dig> seconds on a standard laptop pc. the run time linearly increases with the number of data points. unlike other commonly used clustering methods, misty mountain is not model-based, unsupervised and does not require global optimization of a multi-variable target function. without making strong assumptions, this method provides fast and accurate clustering. the algorithm is general, but was motivated by the need for an unbiased automated method for analysis of flow cytometry data.",

    "prompt": "Write a brief summary capturing essential laboratory findings. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND as sessile organisms, plants have evolved a highly sophisticated and elaborate signaling network to respond and adapt to various biotic and abiotic stresses. to precisely respond to diverse stimuli in different tissues or developmental stages, the defense signaling network must be orchestrated within a larger physiological and developmental context. numerous data from large scale transcriptome profiling analysis strongly support the existence of regulatory interactions and coordination between signaling networks, rather than linear pathways <cit> . to some extent the signaling components of this intricate network to biotic and abiotic stresses are universal <cit> . comparing multiple gene expression experiments performed on the affymetrix ath <dig> platform has identified a universal stress response transcriptome <cit> . in addition to a general stress response, there are also several studies that indicate that plants are able to prioritize between different stresses and that a combination of stresses leads to unique gene expression profiles <cit> . execution of an appropriate defense response is linked to multiple interacting components, including a rapid and transient reactive oxygen species burst, altered cytoplasmic and chloroplastic ca2+ transients, plant hormones including salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , abscisic acid , ethylene, and transcriptional reprogramming <cit> . activation of a ros burst is a common response to both biotic and abiotic stress <cit> . in addition, ros are signaling molecules involved in control and regulation of other biological processes, such as aging, cell death, and development <cit> . exposure of plants with the gaseous ros ozone triggers an apoplastic ros production, which is similar to the ros burst observed after pathogen infection and activation of cell wall peroxidases and nadph oxidases <cit> . extensive comparisons of altered gene expression profiles from arabidopsis thaliana elicited by o <dig> and other abiotic and biotic stresses indicate a high degree of overlap between o <dig> and treatment with a bacterial microbe associated molecular pattern flg <dig> <cit> . one of the earliest responses elicited by flg <dig> treatment is an apoplastic ros burst <cit> , thus providing a mechanistic link for the similarity between gene expression changes elicited by o <dig> and flg <dig> apoplastic ros are also regulators of cell death through interplay with several other signaling pathways, including sa and ja/ethylene signaling pathways <cit> . sa, ja, and ethylene are involved in many aspects of defense signaling and numerous studies have investigated the interaction between these hormones <cit> . it is generally believed that antagonism between sa and ja allows plants to prioritize the defense between biotrophic or necrotrophic pathogens and insects. sa antagonism of ja signaling is a robust response observed both when plants are infected with different pathogens <cit> ; and when plants are directly treated with hormones <cit> . regulators of the sa-ja antagonism include the sa receptor/transcriptional co-activator npr <dig> and the transcription factor ora <dig> <cit> . several additional signals directly or indirectly interplay with sa to promote defense response <cit> . early in 1990s, sa level and ros production were found to be closely connected <cit> . both elevated endogenous sa and application of exogenous sa in arabidopsis and tobacco are accompanied by increased ros production <cit> , indicating the existence of a positive feedback amplification loop with sa and ros as central players. however, continuous defense signal amplification would waste energy and indicate that coordination of sa-dependent and independent signaling components with ros signaling are of central importance to provide an appropriate defense response. lesion mimic mutants that display spontaneous cell death have been extensively used to study the regulation of cell death <cit> . in addition to misregulated cell death they often have other phenotypes including dwarfism, constitutively higher accumulation of sa and enhanced pathogen resistance <cit> . some of them show accumulation of ros in or around the lesion area <cit> , which make lesion mimic mutants a powerful tool to investigate the relationship between ros and sa. in genetic analysis, production of sa can be reduced by the mutation sid <dig> which is defective in the main biosynthesis pathway , or by expression of a bacterial sa degrading enzyme nahg. in several lesion mimic mutants, including acd <dig> acd <dig> and lht <dig> expression of nahg abolishes cell death <cit> . given the importance of sa in defense signaling it is not surprising that several other regulators working in parallel with sa signaling, or affecting sa accumulation, have been identified through various screens including suppression of lesion mimic phenotypes <cit> . these regulators include enhanced disease susceptibility <dig> , ag2-like defense response protein <dig> and flavin-dependent monoxygenase <dig> which regulate cell death and defense responses <cit> . like sid <dig> ald <dig> and fmo <dig> are necessary for systemic accumulation of sa and downstream signaling after pathogen infection <cit> . furthermore, a chloroplastic derived o2- signal can be processed by eds <dig> to control sa-dependent h2o <dig> accumulation as part of a mechanism limiting cell death <cit> . elevation of cytosolic ca2+ and production of ros are among the earliest events after initiation of stress responses <cit> . many studies have explored the role of cngc <dig> in regulation of ca2+ fluxes across the plasma membrane and its contribution to signaling in the context of immunity <cit> , senescence <cit> , heat stress <cit> , and pollen growth <cit> . null mutation of cngc <dig> was first isolated as defense no death <dig> , a mutant which exhibits a lesion mimic phenotype which is dependent on growth conditions <cit> , increased accumulation of sa and constitutive defense activation <cit> , and altered ca2+ transport <cit> . studies conducted in this mutant indicate that the influx of ca2+ is associated with the pleiotropic phenotype; however, the precise mechanism with regards to ca2+ signaling is still elusive. furthermore, whereas in wildtype o <dig> strongly alters transcript levels for many defense genes, in dnd <dig> this response is blocked <cit> . due to the pleiotropic phenotype of dnd <dig> it is far from straight forward to pinpoint the exact process which blocks the apoplastic ros signal initiated by o <dig> treatment. in this study we investigate through genetic analysis the relationship between dnd <dig> the hormones sa, ja and ethylene, and apoplastic ros signaling in the regulation of defense gene expression and cell death. in particular, we identify a novel antagonistic interplay between sa and apoplastic ros signaling that may confer a high degree of responsiveness of plant responses to a fluctuating environment. RESULTS the dnd <dig> mutant displays constitutive expression of defense genes the dnd <dig> mutant displays constitutively elevated concentration of sa and increased expression of sa induced and defense related genes <cit> . however, the phenotypes of dnd <dig> including the appearance of spontaneous cell death, is influenced by growth conditions <cit> . hence, we performed dna microarray analysis on wildtype and dnd <dig> from our growth conditions using six biological repeats . <dig> genes had increased expression and <dig> genes had decreased expression . the annotations for many of these genes in the tair database indicated a function in plant defense responses. to systematically evaluate the role of these genes in plant stress responses a bayesian hierarchal clustering was made with dnd <dig> and experiments performed on the affymetrix ath <dig> chip obtained from public databases . these experiments were selected to include pathogen infection, mutants that display constitutive defense activation or spontaneous cell death, and the stress hormones sa, its analog benzo thiadiazole-7-carbothioc acid s-methyl ester , methyl-jasmonic acid and ethylene . the genes with increased or decreased expression in dnd <dig> were consistently regulated in the similar direction by flg <dig> late sa and bth treatment, in mutants undergoing cell death mkk1mkk <dig> acd <dig> csn <dig> csn <dig> and csn <dig> and in the constitutive defense mutants siz <dig> and lht <dig> cell death in these mutants are initiated via different mechanisms: mkk1mkk <dig> is defective in two map kinase kinases, acd <dig> lacks a ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein, csn <dig> csn <dig> and csn <dig> lack different subunits in the cop <dig> signalosome – a regulator of protein degradation, siz <dig> lacks a sumo e <dig> ligase and lht1lacks a lysine-histidine transporter <cit> . despite different biological mechanisms being altered in these mutants, they displayed a common set of misregulated genes; this could indicate that cell death is executed through a common mechanism. we conclude that dnd <dig> in our growth conditions displayed a constitutive activated defense gene expression profile, similar to other mutants of this class <cit> . mutants with constitutive defense activation are defective in ros signaling treatment of plants with o <dig> generates a precise burst of apoplastic ros and is a convenient tool to study the role of ros in regulation of defense gene expression <cit> . previous analysis of defense marker genes in dnd <dig> treated with o <dig> indicated that this mutant had an attenuated response <cit> . however, the role of the dnd1/cngc <dig> protein in apoplastic ros signaling is an open question, since the pleiotropic phenotype of dnd <dig> including high sa concentration and constitutive activation of defense genes could be the source of altered ros signaling and not the lack of ca2+ transport from removal of dnd1/cngc <dig> to explore this question, dnd <dig> and several other mutants with increased sa concentration and constitutive defense gene expression, cim <dig> cim <dig> lht <dig> and siz1- <dig> <cit> were tested in gene expression analysis using real time reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr with marker genes selected from the dnd <dig> array analysis and previous o <dig> gene expression analysis <cit> . the constitutive defense mutants were selected to include both dwarfed mutants and mutants with more wildtype morphology . consistent with previous characterization of these mutants as constitutive defense mutants, a majority of the marker genes, including pad <dig> sag <dig> wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> had increased expression in the mutants as compared to col- <dig> in control conditions . a two hour o <dig> treatment led to strong induction of the defense genes in col- <dig> whereas the effect of o <dig> was attenuated in all of the constitutive defense mutants, which was more pronounced in dnd <dig> . we conclude that constitutive activation of defense signaling in several different mutants interfere with the plants ability to properly respond to a ros signal from the apoplast. sa signaling inhibits apopastic ros signaling the results in figure <dig> indicate that sa signaling has the capacity to interfere with apoplastic ros signaling. to directly test the role of sa, plants were treated with <dig> or <dig> mm sa <dig> hours before a two hours o <dig> exposure . treatment with sa alone increased the expression of the classical sa marker genes pr <dig> and pr <dig> furthermore, several of the other marker genes in this study were also regulated by sa, including cml <dig> pad <dig> sag <dig> wrky <dig> wrky <dig> zat <dig> and zat <dig> strikingly, sa pre-treatment at both concentrations significantly reduced the response to subsequent treatment with ozone for all marker genes except pr <dig> and pr <dig> . in an attempt to also identify marker genes with an opposite behavior , we tested the expression of frk <dig> a flg <dig> responsive gene <cit> . in contrast to all other genes tested, expression of frk <dig> was synergistically increased by the combined sa and ozone treatment. to further explore whether low endogenous sa level alter apoplastic ros signaling, the sa biosynthesis deficient sid <dig> and the low sa accumulation mutant ald <dig> were used <cit> . in both mutants o <dig> treatment led to a stronger induction of most marker genes than observed in wt plants . we conclude that there exists an inhibition by sa on apoplastic ros signaling in transcriptional activation of defense related genes. elimination of sa in dnd <dig> partially restores its response to apoplastic ros both ros and sa are involved in defense signaling and regulation of cell death responses. furthermore, elevated levels of ros lead to sa accumulation and vice versa, which has been termed the oxidative cell death cycle <cit> . however, deciphering all components involved in the complex ros signaling network through a genetic analysis requires the use of mutants involved in different signaling pathways <cit> . the dnd <dig> mutant was crossed with various other mutants defective in different hormone signals, map kinases, transcription factors, ros biosynthesis or mutants with a previously described role in cell death or defense against pathogens . the extent of cell death in the double and triple mutants was examined with trypan blue staining . of these double mutants, sa biosynthesis or sa signaling related genes sid <dig> ald <dig> eds <dig> and fmo <dig> reduced the amount of cell death and partially restored the altered leaf morphology of dnd <dig> . in selected double mutants gene expression was tested after two hours o <dig> treatment . in dnd1sid <dig> a partially restored response to o <dig> was observed . in contrast, although loss of ald <dig> in dnd <dig> background reduced the amount of cell death, it did not impact on the o <dig> induced gene expression profile . dnd <dig> single, double and triple mutants +represent the relative extent of cell death or size of the rosette. cell death was determined by trypan blue staining as in figures <dig> and <dig> *represent similar leaf shape as dnd <dig> single mutant. the name given to dnd <dig> defense no death, was based on its lack of pathogen induced cell death <cit> . numerous other mutants with spontaneous cell death and elevated levels of sa have been identified and includes accelerated cell death <dig> and calmodulin binding transcription activator <cit> . to further explore if the cell death phenotype of dnd <dig> was due to activation of similar signaling pathway as in other lesion mimic mutants, we introduced the acd <dig> and sr <dig> mutations into the dnd <dig> background. the lesion and dwarfism phenotype in the resulting double mutants were severely enhanced, indicating that dnd <dig> activated cell death in parallel pathways to acd <dig> and sr <dig> . several sa dependent and independent regulators additively contribute to the attenuated apoplastic ros response the results presented in figure <dig> and additional file <dig> demonstrated that sa biosynthesis and signaling regulators, such as ald <dig> pad <dig> and eds <dig> were important for spontaneous lesion formation since inactivation of either one of them partially rescued the dnd <dig> spontaneous cell death phenotype. to further explore how these defense signaling regulators interplayed and contributed to the development of cell death and apoplastic ros response, a number of combinations were made among these genes in dnd <dig> background . the triple mutants dnd1ald1sid <dig> dnd1eds1sid <dig> dnd1sid2pad <dig> and dnd1ald1pad <dig> had less cell death and better growth than all double mutants . to further investigate the role of the combination of these genes in relation to apoplastic ros response, dnd1ald1sid <dig> and dnd1eds1sid <dig> were treated with two hours o <dig> and gene expression of selected marker genes tested with qpcr. remarkably, inactivation of either ald <dig> or eds <dig> in dnd1sid <dig> genetic background completely restored the o <dig> response in dnd <dig> to the wild type . we conclude that several sa dependent and independent signaling pathways, mediated via ald <dig> and eds <dig> are co-activated in lesion formation and contribute to the attenuated apoplastic ros signaling response in dnd <dig> ja signaling restricts lesion formation interplay between the hormones sa and ja optimizes the response to abiotic and biotic stresses <cit> . in addition, the ja insensitive mutants jar <dig> and coi <dig> have previously been shown to be sensitive to o <dig> <cit> . to gain further insight into the role of ja in the dnd <dig> pleiotropic phenotypes, a mutation that blocks ja biosynthesis <cit> , allene oxide synthase was introduced into dnd <dig> and dnd1sid <dig> the dnd1aos double mutants showed severe dwarfism compared to dnd <dig> single mutant . similar to the dnd <dig> single mutant, the dnd1aos double mutant had an attenuated gene expression response after two hours o <dig> treatment . simultaneous mutations of both sa and ja signaling in dnd1sid2aos relieved the growth retardance of the dnd1aos double mutant, but induced more visible chlorosis than either dnd1aos or dnd1sid <dig> double mutants . we conclude that ja has no major role in the attenuation of apoplastic ros signaling, but is involved in regulation of plant development and cell death in the dnd <dig> background. constitutive activation of ethylene signaling does not impact on apoplastic ros signaling the constitutive defense mutants used in figure <dig> are all characterized by having elevated sa concentration <cit> . another plant stress hormone, ethylene, also regulated the same set of genes as in dnd <dig> . the ctr <dig> mutant displays constitutive activation of ethylene signaling <cit> and is a dwarf similar to dnd <dig> . however, no differences were seen between col- <dig> and ctr <dig> in control conditions, or after o <dig> treatment for the marker genes tested in qpcr . we conclude that constitutive activation of ethylene signaling does not interfere with apoplastic ros signaling. discussion antagonistic interaction between plant hormone signaling pathways is frequently observed, exemplified by sa-ja in pathogen responses and cytokinin-auxin in root and shoot development <cit> . in this study we have explored another antagonistic interaction, the attenuation of apoplastic ros signaling by sa at the level of gene expression. several lines of evidence led to this conclusion: mutants that constitutively accumulate higher concentration of sa had a dampened response to o <dig> for several different marker genes and pre-treatment of plants with sa led to attenuation of gene expression after a subsequent o <dig> treatment . conversely, increased o3-induced expression of sa marker genes was observed in the plants with low endogenous sa levels . however, it is also clear that sa alone does not fully explain why lesion mimic mutants such as dnd <dig> have attenuated o <dig> responses. blocking sa biosynthesis by introducing the sid <dig> mutation into dnd <dig> could only partially restore a wildtype gene expression response to o <dig> . instead introduction of an additional mutation in eds <dig> or ald <dig> giving the triple mutants dnd1sid2ald <dig> and dnd1sid2eds <dig> brought back the gene expression pattern to the level of the col- <dig> wildtype . thus, the attenuated o <dig> response in dnd <dig> is due to the inhibition on apoplastic ros signaling by both sa dependent and independent signaling. furthermore, two other defense hormones ethylene and ja did not appear to play any major role in this attenuation of apoplastic ros signaling since ctr <dig> had wildtype response to o <dig> and dnd1aos had a similar response as dnd <dig> . the marker genes selected for qpcr were chosen for their o <dig> induction, however, the expression in single mutants sid <dig> and ald <dig> indicated that especially phytoalexin deficient <dig> and wrky <dig> required a basal amount of sa to reach normal expression levels . in contrast zat <dig> and zat <dig> were not sensitive to background sa . the attenuation of apoplastic ros signaling by sa was valid across all marker genes tested and highlights the robustness of the response . treatment of arabidopsis with flg <dig> rapidly activates an apoplastic rboh-dependent ros burst <cit> , and in turn induces sa related genes, including sid <dig> pr <dig> and npr <dig> <cit> . meta-analysis of microarray data shows that <dig> hours flg <dig> treatment triggers similar changes in gene expression as elicited by an apoplastic ros burst with o <dig> <cit> , implying that flg <dig> and o <dig> induce similar apoplastic ros signals. consistent with our findings that dnd <dig> has an attenuated response to o <dig> , flg <dig> triggered oxidative burst was significantly reduced in dnd <dig> <cit> . flg <dig> treatment can reduce sa induced changes in gene expression <cit> , the same type of interaction observed between apoplastic ros and sa described in this study . this suggests that the effect of flg <dig> on sa mediated gene expression could be mediated via an apoplastic ros burst. if the flg22-sa and apoplastic ros-sa antagonisms are two aspects of the same biological phenomenon, what benefit does this antagonism provide to the plant? activating plant defenses is costly to the plant, and given the large number of potential biotic and abiotic challenges that a plant could face, it has a clear need to prioritize which challenge should be given the highest priority. this forms the basis for sa-ja antagonism where defense against insects and necrotrophic fungi rely on the ja branch and defense against biotrophic pathogens on the sa branch. the apoplastic ros burst could have different sources, either locally from e.g. activation of rboh or cell wall peroxidases by an invading pathogen or from systemic signaling, the so called ros wave. the ros wave is mediated by rbohd generated ros production and its ability to travel along the plant suggests that it could act as a systemic signal in response to various environmental stimuli <cit> . thus, there could be a situation where one part of the plant has already initiated sa mediated defenses due to e.g. pathogen attack, would subsequently be the recipient of the ros wave from another part of the plant. in this situation it might be preferable to execute the already initiated local defense program and put lower emphasis on the systemic ros signal. this might reveal itself as the antagonism by sa on apoplastic ros signaling observed in this study and could be a beneficial way for the plant to respond and prioritize between different environmental stimuli. lesion mimic mutants have been crucial to identify various regulators of cell death, including the role of hormones and ros <cit> . as a lesion mimic mutant, dnd <dig> also contributes to the study of e.g. the potential role of ca2+ in cell death regulation. the extensive double mutant collection generated in this work to study the role of apoplastic ros signaling also allow the dissection of signaling pathways involved in regulation of cell death in dnd <dig> of the <dig> double mutants and seven triple mutants generated, many of them did not alter the extent of cell death, thus excluding a role for map kinases, g-proteins and several transcription factors in execution of cell death in dnd <dig> . however there were several informative mutant combinations mainly related to ethylene, ja, sa and sa-related processes. the ethylene mutants and ja biosynthesis mutant enhanced growth defects of dnd <dig> but did not alter the extent of cell death, implicating that these hormonal signal pathways in the dnd <dig> background are not strictly required for cell death execution. in contrast, ein <dig> enhances cell death in the lesion mimic double mutant syp121syp <dig> <cit> and the ja insensitive coi <dig> enhances the lesions in hrl <dig> <cit> . thus, the requirements for ethylene and ja in cell death regulation appear to be context dependent. sa is a crucial regulator of cell death shown by introducing the sa deficient mutant sid <dig> or a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase into several lesion mimic mutants, including acd <dig> atg <dig> and dnd <dig> <cit> . these observations indicate that biosynthesis of sa via ics <dig> acts as a central hub of a sa inducing cell death program. however, sa depletion by introducing sid <dig> could only partially relieve the cell death in dnd <dig> <cit> . several other mutations which are typically associated with or acting in parallel with sa also partially reduced cell death in dnd <dig> and included eds <dig> pad <dig> ald <dig> and fmo <dig> . furthermore, substantially reduced cell death and improved growth was observed in triple mutants with ald <dig> eds <dig> fmo <dig> or pad <dig> in the dnd1sid <dig> background . fmo <dig> is a suggested positive regulator of cell death <cit> . ald <dig> is associated with biosynthesis of pip . endogenous pip is a regulator of sar and contributes to defense and sa signal amplification <cit> . since cell death was further reduced in dnd1ald1sid <dig> as compared to the double mutants dnd1sid <dig> and dnd1ald <dig> this indicates that sa and the lysine catabolite pip function synergistically in regulating cell death . eds <dig> and pad <dig> are interacting proteins that play multiple roles in plant defenses, including regulation of cell death and amplification of transcriptional responses <cit> . expression of eds <dig> is negatively regulated by camta3/sr <dig> <cit> . mutation of camta3/sr <dig> in dnd <dig> background resulted in enhanced cell death , possibly a result of increased eds <dig> signaling and increased sa production in dnd1sr <dig> extensive double and triple mutant analysis to find regulators of cell death has been done in the background of acd <dig> and syp121syp <dig> <cit> . acd <dig> encodes a plasma membrane protein with a cytoplasmic ankyrin repeat motif, but how this protein migh activate cell death is unknown. the syp121syp <dig> double mutant lacks two syntaxin proteins which are part of the snare machinery, controlling vesicle traffic and bulk transport of cargo in cells. despite the different biological processes impaired in dnd <dig> acd <dig> and syp121syp <dig> exactly the same regulators were found to be the crucial in all three lesion mimic mutants, and implicate sa biosynthesis , in combination with eds <dig> pad <dig> ald <dig> or fmo <dig> as the major pathway towards cell death. furthermore, other double mutants between various lesion mimic mutants and i.e. sid <dig> or eds <dig> show the same suppression of cell death and include acd <dig> <cit> , lsd <dig> <cit> , ssi <dig> <cit> and lht <dig> <cit> . thus in contrast to the context dependence of ja or ethylene for cell death execution, the requirement for sa and eds <dig> appears more universal. future research should focus on how eds <dig> pad <dig> ald <dig> and fmo <dig> interact with sa to regulate cell death. it is unlikely that low sa accumulation on its own would be sufficient to fully prevent cell death <cit> . eds <dig> shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, where nuclear eds <dig> localization regulates defense gene expression <cit> and cytosolic eds <dig> regulates cell death <cit> . however, sa might be more likely to execute its function through changes in gene expression. thus one potential explanation for the full suppression of cell death in lesion mimics when both sid <dig> and eds <dig> are mutated could be that both nuclear and cytosolic regulators of cell death are removed. ald1-dependent pip accumulation in systemic leaves during sar is dependent on fmo <dig> indicating that there is possible signal amplification loop between pip, ald <dig> fmo <dig> and sa <cit> . all together, we propose a signaling network where ald <dig> eds <dig> and fmo <dig> work synergistically with sa to induce cell death in lesion mimic mutants . CONCLUSIONS in summary, we have identified an antagonistic relationship between sa and apoplastic ros signaling that regulate defense gene expression in plants. this mechanism is likely timing and context dependent. furthermore, identification of regulatory components required for execution of cell death in dnd <dig> reinforces the crucial role of sa, ald <dig> and eds <dig> in cell death regulation. how the altered cytosolic ca2+ transport in dnd <dig> connects to downstream signaling pathways will require more studies and may include a recently identified dnd <dig> suppressor mutant, repressor of defense no death <dig> <cit> .",

    "prompt": "Extract and summarize the diagnostic conclusions from this report. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND ageing affects most tissues and physiologic functions, and one of the most affected organs is the skeletal muscle. the progressive decline in muscle mass and function due to ageing, which is also referred to as sarcopenia <cit> , contributes to both loss of autonomy <cit> , increased prevalence of falls, decreased resistance to metabolic aggression that increases morbidity <cit> and mortality <cit> . numerous theories have been proposed to explain muscle ageing. obviously, this is a multifactorial phenomenon which implicates intrinsic factors such as perturbations in the endocrine system, neuronal remodelling, oxidative stress and deficiencies in muscle regeneration, extrinsic factors such as diet and exercise, and also probably other unknown mechanisms <cit> . age-related degenerative changes are reflected in alterations in muscle morphology, function, and biochemical properties. muscle ageing is thus associated with muscle fiber atrophy <cit> , reduced muscle regenerative capacity <cit> , and neuropathic processes leading to motor unit denervation <cit> . mitochondrial dysfunctions with decreased capacity of oxidative enzymes and a decline of mitochondrial atp production may also be observed with ageing in skeletal muscles . the overall functional, structural, and biochemical alterations in ageing muscle have been extensively studied, but the molecular mechanisms implicated remain to be specified. the differential expression profiles of mrnas constitute a first essential level of information, but analyses of the expression profile of proteins in ageing are also required to understand the molecular mechanisms important for the muscle ageing process <cit> . in fact, unlike the genome, the proteome varies in response to many physiological or pathological factors. in addition, the proteome is orders of magnitude more complex than the transcriptome due to post-translational modifications, protein oxidation or limited protein degradation <cit> . several studies have been conducted in rat muscle and proteomic profiling has demonstrated substantial alterations in muscle proteins involved in key metabolic pathways, myofibrillar remodelling, cytoskeleton organisation and mechanisms of cytoprotection and cytodetoxification . however, few studies have been conducted with human muscle and results are contradictory. gelfi et al. <cit> have shown that several enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism, including ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase or aspartate aminotransferase, were more abundant in elderly than in young people, while short et al. <cit> have demonstrated a decrease in these enzymes with ageing. in contrast, some results observed in rat muscle proteomic analyses were confirmed in human muscle, such as a decrease in enzymes involved in glycolytic metabolism and an increase in proteins involved in cytoprotection and cytodetoxification <cit> . because epidemiological studies have indicated accelerated muscle wasting after the fifth decade with an approximately 2% reduction in muscle mass per year <cit> , we have undertaken a top-down differential proteomic approach to determine potential changes after the fifth decade of life and to identify novel biomarkers of muscle ageing. in a previous study, we used a shot-gun proteomics approach to identify <dig> potential biomarkers <cit> . herein, we performed two dimensional gel electrophoreses using biopsies of vastus lateralis from mature adult vs. old women, and for better separation of proteins, two different strategies were conducted. firstly, overlapping immobilized ph gradient with three different ph ranges were used to improve muscle proteins separation, and secondly, we assessed low salt extracts to remove the high abundance myofibrillar proteins and improve the detection of low abundance proteins. the proteomic profiling of aged skeletal muscle fibers revealed a differential expression pattern of <dig> potential biomarkers important for energy metabolism, contractile properties, calcium signaling, cytoprotection, regulation of protein misfolding, and proteolysis. the present study demonstrates that alterations of muscle function in elderly women are associated with severe perturbed protein expression patterns and identified <dig> new potential biomarkers of sarcopenia that had not previously been described. RESULTS differentially expressed proteins during ageing in order to evaluate age-dependent alterations in the skeletal muscle proteome after the fifth decade of life, total muscle extracts from biopsies of mature adult versus old post-menopausal women were resolved by 2dge. gels with overlapping range of ipgs were used to improve the separation of total muscle extracts. 2dge with medium range ipgs revealed <dig> protein spots that were matched between all individuals. among these protein spots, <dig> were found to be differentially expressed between adult and old women, and <dig> were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry , corresponding to <dig> different proteins . 2dge with acidic ipgs distinguished <dig> matched protein spots, and among them <dig> were differentially expressed and identified as <dig> different proteins . narrow ipgs were also used to achieve optimal resolution in the ph <dig> - <dig> range, and this revealed a further <dig> matched spots. among these <dig> spots, statistical analysis revealed <dig> differentially expressed spots which were identified by lc-ms/ms as <dig> different proteins .figure <dig>

spots were differentially expressed between adult and old women. among them, <dig> were identified by lc-ms/ms , and they corresponded to <dig> different proteins. targeting the lis sub-proteome improved the 2dge analysis of the muscle proteome, as most differentially expressed lis proteins were not found in total muscle extracts.figure <dig> representative 2dge image obtained from low ionic

gels were stained using colloidal coomassie blue g- <dig> differentially expressed and identified proteins are marked and spot numbers refer to table <dig> interestingly, shot-gun proteomics previously identified <dig> potential biomarkers in the lis sub-proteome <cit> . it should be noted that, although shot-gun and 2dge proteomics are based on different strategies , the two techniques are complementary, as only <dig> common proteins were found in both investigations: titin , ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein <dig> , l-lactate dehydrogenase β , furamate hydratase , fatty acid binding protein <dig> and carbonic anhydrase <dig> . overall in the present 2dge study, <dig> protein spots were matched between all individuals, <dig> were differentially expressed and identified, and they corresponded to <dig> different proteins. table <dig> and table <dig> summarize the main properties of the proteins differentially regulated in skeletal muscle between adult and old post-menopausal women. absolute fold changes varied from <dig> to <dig> . even though some fold-changes appeared relatively small, there were parallel changes of several components in each pathway or biological process, suggesting some important coordinated and specific regulations.table <dig> differentially expressed muscle proteins in total extract between adult and old post-menauposal women perturbations of the myofilament network and cytoskeleton with ageing sarcomeric proteins muscle contraction is generated by an interaction between the molecular motor myosin and filamentous actin. myosin is a hexameric protein that consists of two heavy chain subunits, two alkali light chain subunits and two regulatory light chain subunits. myosin light chains typically exhibit various isoforms, and in our study, muscle ageing was associated with higher level of one myosin light chain 1/ <dig> skeletal muscle isoform and lower level of one myosin regulatory light chain <dig> ventricular/cardiac muscle isoform . perturbations in myofibrillar contractile proteins were confirmed by the up-regulation of one isoform of fast troponin t which is a major regulator of the thin filament. troponin t directly interacts with key components in the thin filament regulatory system to mediate the activation and force development of actomyosin contractile units <cit> . age-related changes in fibers expressing various myosin light chain isoforms were previously described for myl <dig> myl <dig> and tnnt <dig> <cit> ; however, these changes were manifested differentially in distinct muscles. interestingly, the old skeletal muscle also exhibited altered levels of several fragments of sarcomeric proteins. thus, there were higher levels of n-terminal and c-terminal fragments of skeletal α-actin , and a higher level of a c-terminal fragment of myosin- <dig> , the type iix adult fast myosin heavy chain. the old muscle also exhibited lower level of a c-terminal fragment of ttn , when compared to adult muscle. such fragments were not observed for non-sarcomeric proteins, and may indicate perturbations in sarcomeric proteolytic pathways. a feature of human muscle ageing was also the increased expression of ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein <dig> . ankrd <dig> is a member of the mechano-sensing proteins that link myofibrillar stress response to muscle gene expression <cit> . ankrd <dig> interacts both with i-band sarcomeric proteins and with nuclear transcription factors <cit> . this stretch-response protein is preferentially expressed in slow type-i fibers, and is induced by denervation, which is consistent with neuronal remodeling in ageing muscle <cit> . aging of skeletal muscle involves a decrease in both total number and size of muscle fibers. no consensus has been reached in the literature on whether hypoplasia is associated with a shift in fiber type distribution towards higher , lower <cit> or unaltered <cit> percentages of type-i versus type-ii fibers. however, previous studies based on myosin heavy chain histochemistry agreed that atrophy mostly affects type-ii fibers <cit> . in our 2dge analyses, there was no clear evidence for a fast-to-slow transition on the unique basis of the differential expression of myosin light chain and troponin isoforms. cytoskeletal proteins the integrity of muscle fibers depends on cytoskeletal components, which align sarcomeres and anchor them across the sarcolemma to the basement membrane <cit> . two isoforms of vinculin were enhanced during ageing. vcl localizes to adhesion junctions and is a central component of muscle costameres <cit> . vcl is placed between the integrin-talin complex and the actin cytoskeleton and is a major candidate for transduction of force during the contractile cycle. besides binding to actin, vcl interacts with signaling networks and is important for signal transduction between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton <cit> . finally, the four and a half lim domain protein <dig> , which is down-regulated in our analysis, is an adaptor protein with numerous interaction partners. in adult fibers, fhl <dig> interacts with cytoskeletal actin <cit> and co-localizes with integrin receptors at the periphery of z-discs <cit> . by binding to integrin and actin, fhl <dig> might then directly link the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. fhl <dig> also plays a role in myogenic progenitor cells , where it localizes to the nucleus and has been implicated in the regulation of proliferation <cit> and differentiation <cit> . vcl and fhl <dig> have not been previously identified by proteomic surveys of human skeletal muscle ageing <cit> . shot-gun proteomics confirmed the up-regulation of ankrd <dig> <cit> , and western blotting experiments performed with total muscle extracts confirmed the differential expressions that we observed for vcl and fhl <dig> in lis extracts . in all, the modifications that we report for sarcomeric actomyosin and cytoskeletal proteins are most likely related to disorganization of myofibers in old muscles. moreover, these changes suggest an influence of the ageing process on the maintenance of the proper organization of sarcolemma in regular structures that are closely linked to costameres, and on the response to extracellular signals. thus, the age-related changes in sarcomeric and cytoskeletal proteins may result in alterations in contractile properties and contribute to the development of sarcopenia.figure <dig> examples of differential expression of cytoskeletal proteins. representative sections of 2dge images and representative western blots for vinculin and four and a half lim domains <dig> . in each panel, histograms represent normalized volume of protein spot , and western blot quantification for adult and old post-menopausal women. results are indicated as means ± se. *: p < <dig> indicates significant difference between adult and old women. age-related changes in skeletal muscle affect signal transduction in skeletal muscle, intracellular calcium is an important secondary messenger for signal transduction and is essential for cellular processes such as excitation-contraction coupling. action potentials elicit contractions by releasing ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via the ryanodine receptors . ryrs are modulated directly or indirectly by various ions, small molecules and proteins, including calsequestrin. in this study, proteomics analysis of muscle ageing identified an up-regulation of calsequestrin- <dig> , which is a major intra-sr ca2+ buffer that regulates the activity of ryrs <cit> . ryr receptors have several potential phosphorylation sites in their cytoplasmic domains and protein kinase a has been shown to phosphorylate ryrs. our analysis shows an increased level of the pka type iα regulatory subunit during ageing. among other substrates pka can phosphorylate ryr, and pka-mediated phosphorylation of ryr may result in leaky ryr channels and impaired ca2+ homeostasis <cit> . after initiation of muscle contraction by increasing cytoplasmic ca2+, ca2+ is pumped back to the sr by sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase leading to relaxation. sarcalumenins are major luminal glycoproteins that codistribute with serca and play a role in ca2+ transport and sequestration <cit> . there are two srl isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing <cit> . in the present study, the 53-kda isoform was found to be reduced in aged human muscle, and this reduction was confirmed by western-blotting . the age-related decrease of srl is in agreement with previous studies in rat muscle indicating a shorter half-life of the 53-kda isoform <cit> and a lower level of the 160-kda isoform <cit> .figure <dig> examples of differential expression of proteins implicated in signal transduction. representative sections of 2dge images and representative western blots for sarcalumenin , myozenin- <dig> , annexin a <dig> , annexin a <dig> and glutathione s-transferase omega- <dig> . in each panel, histograms represent normalized volume of protein spot , and western blot quantification for adult and old post-menopausal women. results are indicated as means ± se. *: p < <dig> indicates significant difference between adult and old women. we have also identified an up-regulation of myozenin- <dig> which is expressed in fast-twitch fibers of skeletal muscle and modulates the function and substrate specificity of calcineurin, a ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase that plays an important role in transducing calcium-dependent signals <cit> . this increase in myoz <dig> was also confirmed by western-blotting . in skeletal muscle, numerous proteins can bind ca2+, and muscle ageing was further associated with higher level of three members of the annexin family which undergo ca2+-dependent binding to the cellular membranes. we identified annexin a <dig> , a <dig> and a <dig> . annexins have been involved in a broad range of molecular and cellular processes. noteworthy anxa <dig> may contribute to the regeneration of skeletal muscle tissue by modulating migration <cit> and fusion <cit> of satellite cells. anxa <dig> is overexpressed in different muscular dystrophies <cit> and can further participate in sarcolemmal and t-tubular repair processes <cit> . anxa <dig> also promotes membrane repair by self-assembling into two-dimensional arrays on membranes <cit> . anxa <dig> was originally described as a protein that provokes fusion of lipid vesicules <cit> . more recently, anxa <dig> was identified as an essential protein for autophagy induction by modulating the intracellular ca2+ concentration <cit> . western-blotting experiments confirmed the overexpression of anxa <dig> and anxa <dig> in total extracts of old muscle, compared to adult muscle. glutathione s-transferase omega- <dig> is distinguished from the other glutathione s-transferase family members by a different active center amino acid residue, which results in loss of prototypical glutathione conjugating activity <cit> . instead, human gsto <dig> is reported to potentiate skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor <cit> . the age-related down-regulation of gsto <dig> was confirmed by western-blot , and may thereby be involved in the impairment of ca2+ homeostasis. most of these signal transduction proteins have never been reported in previous proteomic studies of muscle ageing. overall, our findings suggest significant alterations in ca2+ signaling which may be important for the age-related modifications in muscle contractile properties and may contribute to muscle weakness. perturbations in the energy metabolism of old muscle disturbance in energy metabolism is another characteristic feature of old muscles. decreased activities of glycolytic enzymes were previously reported in rat <cit> and in human <cit> skeletal muscles, whereas expression of mitochondrial enzymes was more controversial in the literature <cit> . our study points to an age-associated decline in key enzymes of the glycolytic, krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. cytoplasmic energy metabolism in the current study, perturbations in the energy metabolism of old muscle were indicated by the down-regulation of five isoforms of monomeric creatine kinase . sds-stable dimeric and trimeric forms of ckm were previously described in mice muscle <cit> , and we also observed age-related decreases in dimeric and trimeric forms of ckm. creatine/phosphocreatine is central to maintain energetic homeostasis as it connects intracellular sites of energy demand with sites of atp production. at these sites, ckm catalyses the transphosphorylation between phosphocreatine and adp. in sarcomeric m-line, ckm interacts with myomesin and supplies atp for the actomyosin contractile unit. the first step of glycogenolysis pathway is the production of glucose-6-phosphate by glycogen phosphorylase , which catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of a glucosyl residue from the glycogen polymer. four isoforms of pygm increased, and one decreased with ageing. the resulting glucose 1-phosphate molecule is converted by phosphoglucomutase to glucose 6-phosphate. proteomic analysis revealed a decreased expression of phosphoglucomutase- <dig> in elderly women. several glycolytic enzymes were also down-regulated with ageing. enolase catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. in the muscle of post-menopausal women, four isoforms of the muscle specific β-enolase were selectively decreased during ageing. we also detected lower levels of ldhb which catalyzes the inter-conversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant inter-conversion of nadh and nad+. finally, down-regulations of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like protein were observed. cytosolic gpd <dig> together with its mitochondrial isoform, constitute the gpd <dig> shuttle, which is essential for mitochondrial oxidation of glycolytic nadh. although less active than its gpd <dig> counterpart, gpd1l exhibits dehydrogenase activity, and is also implicated in the regulation of hypoxia <cit> . age-related decline in cytoplasmic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase may indicate reduced mitochondrial oxidation of cytosolic nadh in old muscle. triosephosphate isomerase , that catalyzes the isomerization of the dihydroxyacetone phosphate and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, was the only glycolytic enzyme more abundant in old muscle. tpi <dig> ensures that dhap produced by aldolase is further metabolized by the glycolytic enzymes. impairment of tpi <dig> can result in chemical conversion of dhap into toxic methylglyoxal <cit> promoting the formation of advanced glycation end-products. in the old muscle, an increased level of tpi <dig> may then represent a compensatory adaptation to avoid excessive formation of toxic products <cit> . mitochondrial energy metabolism alterations in the mitochondrial krebs cycle were revealed by the age-dependent reduction in two subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig> component subunit β and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase , and by the reduction in aconitate hydratase and fh , two enzymes that catalyze the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate and the hydration of furamate to malate, respectively. moreover, alterations in oxidative phosphorylation were also revealed by lower levels of three components of the respiratory chain, nadh dehydrogenase iron-sulfur protein <dig> of complex i , cytochrome b-c <dig> complex subunit rieske of complex iii and subunit 5a of cytochrome c oxidase of complex iv . ageing was further associated with lower level of atp synthase subunit β . among these proteins implicated in energy metabolism, two have never been reported in previous muscle ageing studies, and fh and atp5b were similarly found in our shot-gun experiment <cit> . western blotting experiments confirmed alterations in glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, as we observed decreased expression of eno <dig> gpd <dig> ndufs <dig> and uqcrfs <dig> in total extracts of old muscle compared to adult muscle . concomitant decreases of key enzymes of krebs cycle and major complexes of oxidative phosphorylation provided evidences for alteration of mitochondrial metabolism in the old skeletal muscle.figure <dig> examples of differential expression of proteins implicated in energy metabolism. representative sections of 2dge images and representative western blots for β-enolase , glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , nadh dehydrogenase fe-s protein <dig> and cytochrome b-c <dig> complex subunit rieske . in each panel, histograms represent normalized volume of protein spot , and western blot quantification for adult and old post-menopausal women. results are indicated as means ± se. *: p < <dig> indicates significant difference between adult and old women. lipid metabolism in addition to glucose, lipids are another source of energy in skeletal muscle. several intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins have been identified. they have important functions in the transport of intracellular fatty acids by increasing their solubility and have been shown to enhance the transport of fatty acids from the cell membrane to the site of oxidation, i.e. the mitochondria, and to the site of esterification into intramyocellular triglycerol <cit> . muscle ageing was associated with the down-regulation of heart fabp , the major fabp in skeletal muscle, and the up-regulation of adipocyte fabp . fabp <dig> plays an important, but merely permissive role in fatty acid uptake by skeletal muscles <cit> . fabp <dig> is an adipocyte marker, but is also expressed in muscle fibers <cit> . therefore, the age-related up-regulation of fabp <dig> may relate to increased number of adipocytes, and/or to an increased expression in muscle fibers. except in our shot-gun study <cit> , fabp <dig> was not noticed in previous reports on sarcopenia. of note, the lipid chaperone fabp <dig> was also identified as a predominant positive regulator of toxic lipid-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress <cit> , and fabp <dig> up-regulation could suggest increased er stress in old muscle. overall, our proteomic analyses therefore provided strong evidences for a decline in both glycolytic and mitochondrial energy metabolism in the old skeletal muscle. declines in mitochondrial oxidative capacity were previously reported with advancing age <cit> , although physical activity, rather than chronological age, was also reported to be the primary determinant <cit> . because the activity score was significantly higher for the adult than for the old women group, future studies will be required to specify whether mitochondrial oxidative capacity still decreases in old subjects maintaining physical activity scores. detoxification of cytotoxic products and cytoprotection in the old muscle protection against mitochondrial oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunctions may lead to an excessive production of reactive oxygen species , and accumulating evidences suggest that oxidative stress underlies the ageing process in skeletal muscle <cit> . the removal of h2o <dig> in cells is mediated by catalase , glutathione peroxidase and peroxiredoxin <cit> . in the present study, ageing of human skeletal muscle was associated with lower levels of cat and higher levels of prdx <dig> . because cat is localized preferentially in peroxisomes <cit> , its function is limited to the inactivation of h2o <dig> diffusing into these organelles. in contrast, prdx <dig> is the only peroxiredoxin restricted to mitochondria, and high levels of prdx <dig> may provide a primary line of defence against h2o <dig> over-produced by the respiratory chain in old muscle mitochondria. neither cat nor prdx <dig> have previously been reported in proteomic analyses of muscle ageing. a wide range of activities have been reported for protein dj- <dig> , however, there is consensus that park <dig> is responsive and protective against mitochondrial oxidative stress <cit> . park <dig> is an atypical peroxiredoxin-like peroxidase <cit> . during oxidative attack, park <dig> is relocalized to mitochondria, has a functional role in scavenging mitochondrial h2o <dig> and decreases mitochondrial fragmentation <cit> . therefore elevated levels of park <dig> in the old muscle may be important in regulating cellular antioxidant capacity. detoxification of cytotoxic products oxidative stress increases the production of cytotoxic aldehydes, which can react with cellular proteins, nucleic acids and cell membranes. protection against reactive aldehydes is provided by several families of detoxification enzymes, including aldo-keto reductase and aldehyde dehydrogenase . our proteomic analysis provided evidences for perturbed scavenging of reactive aldehyde products in the old muscle, as aldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase , were up-regulated, while aldose reductase and delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase decreased with ageing. similar regulations were previously reported during ageing in rat skeletal muscle for aldh <dig> <cit> and akr1b <dig> <cit> . however, no previous study of muscle ageing has identified the differential expression of akr1a <dig> and aldh4a <dig> the mitochondrial enzyme aldh <dig> detoxifies aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes , which are produced during oxidative stress as a result of lipid peroxidation <cit> . the cytosolic oxidoreductase akr1a <dig> has broad substrate specificity, and similarly catalyzes the reduction of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, ketones, and xenobiotics <cit> . the up-regulations of aldh <dig> and akr1a <dig> thus suggest enhanced scavenging of reactive aldehyde products in the old skeletal muscle. our western blot analyses confirmed that muscle ageing is associated with higher levels of aldh <dig> .figure <dig> examples of differential expression of proteins implicated in cytoprotection, cytodetoxification or proteolysis. representative sections of 2dge images and representative western blots for aldehyde dehydrogenase , α-crystallin b chain , heat shock <dig> kda protein 1a/1b , hsp 90-beta , and transitional endoplasmic reticulum atpase . in each panel, histograms represent normalized volume of protein spot , and western blot quantification for adult and old post-menopausal women. results are indicated as means ± se. *: p < <dig> indicates significant difference between adult and old women. while aldh <dig> and akr1a <dig> act principally as detoxification enzymes, akr1b <dig> and aldh4a <dig> have additional roles besides that of detoxification. accumulating evidence attributes a significant role to akr1b <dig> in transducing cytotoxic signals initiated by inflammatory cytokines <cit> . akr1b <dig> inhibitors have been reported to disrupt signalling cascades leading to nfkb activation <cit> , and reduced levels of akr1b <dig> may therefore be important to limit activation of the nfkb pathway in the old muscle. aldh4a <dig> amino acid sequence diverges from the other aldh <cit> and this enzyme is mostly involved in metabolic regulation <cit> . aldh4a <dig> is metabolically important, since its substrate appears as a common intermediate in the degradative and biosynthetic pathways of the amino acids arginine, citrulline, ornithine and proline to and from glutamic acid. the down regulation of aldh4a <dig> may thus indicate reduced intermediary metabolism in the old skeletal muscle. quality control of cellular proteins to detect, refold, and eventually eliminate abnormal proteins, cells use quality control mechanisms that buffer protein homeostasis against cellular stress. the proteomic analysis described here demonstrated the differential regulation of <dig> spots identified as heat shock proteins . all were increased with ageing and they encompassed <dig> hsp groups in human: hspa, hspb and hspc <cit> . the small heat shock proteins are atp-independent chaperones. hspbs prevent the aggregation of improperly folded or partially denatured proteins, and are involved in their transfer to the atp-dependent chaperones or to the protein degradation processes such as proteasomes or autophagosomes <cit> . three hspbs displayed higher levels in old women compared to adult women: heat shock protein beta- <dig> , alpha-crystallin b chain and heat shock protein beta- <dig> . similar up-regulation of hspb <dig> hspb <dig> and hspb <dig> have been previously reported for rat muscle ageing <cit> . our western blot experiments performed with total muscle extracts confirmed that the old human muscle exhibited higher levels of hspb <dig> than adult muscle . in addition to chaperone activities, hspb <dig> and hspb <dig> have the ability to control the redox status, protect the actin cytoskeleton <cit> and inhibit apoptotic cell death <cit> . the atp-dependent chaperones of the hspa group are essential for proteostasis as they contribute to the folding and assembly of nascent polypeptides, the transport of proteins across membranes, and the selection of misfolded proteins for degradation <cit> . muscle ageing was associated with the up-regulation of two hspa proteins: the heat shock <dig> kda protein 1a/1b , and the mitochondrial stress- <dig> protein . none of these hspa have been previously reported in proteomic analyses of muscle ageing, and our western blot experiments confirmed the age-related up-regulation of hspa1a . hspa1a is the most abundant inducible cytoprotective hsp <dig> chaperone. notably in rodents, overexpression of hspa1a has been repeatedly reported to attenuate muscle atrophy induced by immobilization <cit> , lengthening contractions <cit> or cryo-lesions <cit> . it is therefore likely that the old human muscle may increase hspa1a levels as a protection against muscle atrophy. hspa <dig> is a central component of the mitochondrial protein import motor and it plays a key role in the folding of matrix-localized mitochondrial proteins. hspa <dig> is the only known mitochondrial hsp <dig> chaperone, and thus serves as a unique scavenger of toxic protein aggregates in human mitochondria <cit> . one hspc was further found to be up-regulated in these ageing muscles: the heat shock protein hsp <dig> . hsp <dig> which has not been identified in previous muscle ageing studies, is another important chaperone that functions downstream of hspa in the atp-dependent folding and conformational regulation of many client proteins, including protein kinases, steroid receptors, endothelial no synthase and transcription factors <cit> . most of the clients, with which hsp <dig> interacts, are thus involved in signal transduction, making hsp <dig> a critical factor in cell signalling. western blot experiments confirmed the age-related up-regulation of hsp 90-beta . finally and in addition to the hsp proteins, the chaperone operating in the endoplasmic reticulum , protein disulfide-isomerase a <dig> , was also found to increase with human muscle ageing, and this observation is in agreement with previous studies in rat <cit> . pdia <dig> is a multifunctional protein with thiol-protein disulphide oxidoreductase activity, which ensures proper folding of glycoproteins and assembly of major histocompatibility complex class i complex <cit> . outside the er, pdia <dig> also functions as a plasma membrane receptor for 1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin d <dig> <cit> , which might be important with regard to the implication of vitamin d in ageing <cit> . cytoprotection in the old skeletal muscle in agreement with a previous study in rat <cit> , higher levels of two isoforms of carbonic anhydrase <dig> were identified in senescent human muscle. no consensus has been reached in the literature about ca <dig> as both increased <cit> and decreased levels <cit> were observed in old muscles. our analyses of muscle ageing in women indicated an overexpression of <dig> isoforms of ca <dig> and this was confirmed by our shot-gun study <cit> . the various isoforms of cas play a crucial role in co2-removal and co2-provision for metabolic processes, and are central for the acid–base balance and the regulatory processes of ion homeostasis. numerous proteins are involved in ion homeostasis, including the selenium-binding protein <dig> of which two isoforms were increased and one isoform was decreased in ageing. proteolytic systems muscle proteins are continuously turning over, and cells contain multiple proteolytic systems to carry out the degradation process. several components of the major proteolytic systems, i.e. ubiquitin-proteasome <cit> and lysosomal autophagy <cit> , were in the present study differentially regulated with ageing in human skeletal muscle. the old muscle thus exhibited higher levels of the ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme <dig> , and transitional endoplasmic reticulum atpase , while the proteasome subunit beta type- <dig> , uv excision repair protein rad <dig> homolog a and mitochondrial elongation factor tu were down-regulated during ageing. the vcp atpase binds multiple ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitinated proteins and triggers extraction of client proteins from complexes or cellular surfaces, often to facilitate degradation by the proteasome <cit> . vcp is thus central for the extraction and degradation of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum-associated <cit> and mitochondrial membrane proteins <cit> . vcp is also involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, such as dna repair <cit> , myofibril biogenesis <cit> , membrane fusion <cit> , autophagosome maturation <cit> and mitophagy <cit> . the up-regulation of vcp in skeletal muscle of old women was confirmed by western-blot analysis , and is in agreement with previous observations in rat muscle <cit> . the scaffold protein rad23a, which was originally identified as an important factor involved in the recognition of dna lesions <cit> , also serves as an ubiquitin receptor and plays a central role in targeting polyubiquitynated proteins, including erad substrates, for proteasomal degradation <cit> . tufm is important to deliver aminoacyl-trna to mitochondrial ribosome, and also promotes autophagy by interacting with autophagy-related proteins atg12–atg <dig> and atg16l <dig> <cit> . in addition to intracellular proteolysis, proteomics analysis of muscle ageing identified an up-regulation of the xaa-pro dipeptidase , an extracellular proteinase which specifically splits iminodipeptides with c-terminal proline or hydroxyproline. because of the high level of iminoacids in collagen, pepd seems to be important for extracellular matrix remodeling <cit> . at the extracellular level, we also found that muscle ageing was associated with lower level of anti-thrombin iii , which belongs to the family of serine protease inhibitors. with the exception of vcp <cit> , none of these potential proteolysis biomarkers has previously been mentioned in any proteomic study on muscle ageing. serum and transport proteins several spots were identified as differentially expressed plasma transport proteins. a number of these proteins were found decreased in aged muscle, including vitamin d binding protein , transthyretin and apolipoprotein a-i . vitamin d binding protein is a major plasma transport protein for vitamin d, while ttr transports thyroxine and retinol through the association with retinol-binding protein. as a major component of the high density lipoprotein complex, apoa <dig> helps to clear fats, including cholesterol, from peripheral tissues. apoa <dig> is also partly localized on skeletal muscle lipid droplets <cit> . in contrast, serotransferrin , which controls level of iron and oxidative stress by increasing iron uptake, was up-regulated in aged muscle. another serum protein, fibrinogen gamma chain , was decreased during ageing. altered levels of serum proteins may be related to impaired blood-flow distribution that has been reported in aged muscle fibers <cit> . miscellaneous two isoforms of the es <dig> protein homolog also decreased in aged muscle. c21orf <dig> is ubiquitously expressed but strongly so in heart and skeletal muscle and potential mitochondrial targeting signals were found in this protein <cit> , but its actual physiologic function is not known. cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase <dig> mainly catalyzes the dephosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates, and therefore plays an important role in both endogenous nucleoside and nucleotide pool balance <cit> . the age-related down-regulation of nt5c3a that we observed in senescent women has not been previously reported in the literature. finally, spot <dig> decreased <dig> -fold and is identified as apolipoprotein b mrna-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like <dig> that belongs to the cytidine deaminase superfamily and mediates editing of mrna. interestingly, apobec <dig> deficiency in mice has recently been associated with a shift to a slow-fiber type in muscle, and with diminished body mass and mild myopathy <cit> . CONCLUSIONS to conclude, our proteomics analyses has resulted in the identification of numerous proteins whose expression is dysregulated in old skeletal muscle. to our knowledge, this is the most extensive proteomic study of muscle ageing in humans. all these proteins have been classified into seven major groups, associated with myofilaments and cytoskeleton, energy metabolism, detoxification, cytoprotection, signal transduction, proteostasis and proteolysis, and figure <dig> summarizes the functional interaction networks linking the differentially expressed proteins. many of the candidate proteins identified in this study by differential proteomics were previously unrecognized in previous ageing studies of skeletal muscle, in particular for proteins implicated in cytoprotection, signal transduction or proteolysis. by comparing adult and old post-menopausal women, we have identified a group of proteins in old skeletal muscle, which indicates potential mechanisms of ageing and may lead to the development of new biomarkers of sarcopenia and novel targets for therapeutic intervention.figure <dig> string interaction network showing the association between differentially expressed proteins in old post-menopausal women compared to adult women. the interaction map was generated using string <cit> and default settings . the proteins names used in this network are listed in tables <dig> and <dig>",

other subjects at intra-host level. in this field, a deep insight has been reached in phylogenetic reconstructions for instance <cit> . however, oddly enough, computational biology is rarely associated with the study of larger systems such as ecosystem dynamics. more specifically, despite a huge amount of mathematical models which increasing complexity, little work has been done in computational biology to understand the transmission of disease agents in natural populations and communities of hosts. in the current context of disease emergence <cit> , computational modeling could become the tool of choice for dissecting the complexity of mechanisms that can be at work to produce disease outbreaks. so far, mathematical models have been mainly used for epidemiological modeling. the prolific development of mathematical models has been mostly caused by the existence of a standard model, the so-called sir model. this \"toy\" model has been extensively studied and applied <cit> and it has proved to be particularly accurate for many different biological questions, both in epidemiology <cit> and evolution <cit> . the strength of this model relies on its adaptability <cit> and simplicity of formulation, despite its current complexity in generated patterns <cit> . spatial modeling suffers of a dramatic lack of this type of reference models except for directly-transmitted diseases. these diseases, where pathogens are transmitted between individuals by close contacts, can be spatially analyzed using an implicit standard model based on cellular automata <cit> . some more complex models exist for avian influenza <cit> , but they have been done in a prospective way. other kinds of diseases have been poorly studied in a spatial context, especially vector-borne diseases. these pathogens are transmitted between reservoir individuals, which are generally vertebrate hosts, by the bite of one vector individual, which is generally an haematophagous insect, such as a tick or a mosquito. despite an huge literature in a non-spatial context <cit> , spatial models are rare for vector-borne disease <cit> . however, these models, built upon the framework of cellular automata, involve very simple systems with only one vector and one reservoir species, when typically vector-borne diseases can locally involve several vector and reservoir species <cit> . hence, current approaches, i.e. mathematical modeling or cellular automata modeling, seems to be unable to study vector-borne diseases with a large host spectra within an heterogeneous environment. we thus develop a spatial model, based upon the framework of multi-agent systems <cit> , for multi-host vector-borne diseases in realistic environments. four main categories of spatial models can be distinguished <cit> , depending on the kind of tools used and the biological questions considered. the first one is the reaction-diffusion system that is based on physical processes, and has been mainly used for vector-borne diseases and more specifically for vector spreading <cit> . it assumes a continuous diffusion of vectors but it is likely to be not the most suitable for realistic environments. the second is a model based on the network theory <cit> . this theory has supported studies on the impact of transport networks in disease dynamics <cit> and focuses on the properties of the network studied. the third method is based on metapopulation theory <cit> . this conceptual framework has been widely used for the study of spatio-temporal dynamics of infectious diseases, especially childhood diseases <cit> . however, despite that this theory has been widely applied in conceptual frameworks, it focuses mainly on a nation-wide scale <cit> or at least on large-surface areas. the last available tools are multi-agent systems <cit> , that are based on cellular automata <cit> , but that are applied in a more \"cognitive\" way. boundaries between multi-agent and cellular automata often seem mostly philosophical and semantic. an extensive literature on multi-agent systems exists, especially in social sciences <cit> and ecology <cit> . in epidemiology, despite some individual-based models for directly-transmitted diseases <cit> , multi-agent systems have not yet been used to study vector-borne disease dynamics in spatial contexts. here, we describe a simple and robust multi-agent model which can be easily extended to the study of more complex situations. then, we show three extensions of our model in the section \"examples of adaptability\". the first one is the possibility to integrate a real landscape derived from a geographical information system software. since this kind of input often requires highly-intensive computing, we have then developed a parallel version of our model. finally, we show how the evolutionary dynamics dimension of host-parasite systems can be integrated into our model. methods philosophy of this model earlier individual-based systems <cit> were quite complex and used the computational framework to produce very complicated models. the main target of these models was to make predictions about possible future dynamics of a given disease. we followed a totally different approach in order to build a very simple model, and in this paper we will: give a clear and detailed description of our simple spatial model to be used as a \"reference\" for vector-borne diseases, define the core mechanisms of vector-borne diseases in a spatial context that, hopefully, will be used as reference for future studies and explain how this model could be easily adapted to other disease situations. the theoretical analysis putted in the supplementary informations has been done with an high value of pathogen transmission to allow us an analysis without an huge number of host individuals, both vectors and reservoirs. our epidemiological framework was inspired by the classical model proposed first by kermarck and mck-endrick <cit> and most popularized by anderson and may <cit> . accordingly, we classified the two types of hosts, i.e. vectors and reservoirs, involved in disease transmission into four categories. individuals are born in a \"susceptible\", not infected, state. upon infection, individuals become \"infected\", but at this stage they are unable to infect other hosts. then, after a given \"latency period\", those individuals become \"infectious\" and can infect other subjects. finally, after an \"infectious period\", individuals become \"recovered\" and they are immune against the disease agent, with the exception of vector individuals which remain infectious until their death <cit> . however, some vector-borne pathogen, like plasmodium falciparum, could develop an immunity in mosquito species. to remove this limitation, an adaptation of \"step\" function is needed. we assume that an immunity is developed into reservoir individuals despite that some pathogens do not lead to immunity for reservoir individuals <cit> . to remove this immunity, the field \"infectious period\" could be filled with zero. it is important to note that this model has been developed to study, in its current form, a virus transmitted by mosquitoes species. however, our model is easily adaptable for other kind of vector-borne diseases as we discuss for different assumptions. this model could be analyzed in both ways : a conceptual way to study, for instance, the structure of spatio-temporal dynamics of vector-borne diseases and an applied way by integrating real data, from a gis for instance, which allow us to track, and eventually to predict, the spatio-temporal dynamics of a given disease in a given environment, like west nile fever in southern france for instance. from an ecological point of view, the present model is supported by a strong theoretical and empirical framework <cit> . we assumed that host species were distributed spatially and clustered within different specific ecological habitats. hence, host species within a habitat could not leave their original habitat except within a given range of tolerance value. this important parameter will be further developed, especially in additional file <dig> section <dig> . we developed this model in order to be able to study dynamics of vector-borne diseases when multiple host species are involved ; however it might also be applied to assess other scientific questions with similar objectives. components of the multi-agent system we used an oriented-object approach in which a \"class\" is an abstract pattern of a physical representation and an \"object\" an instance of a class. each class could be linked to other classes by \"attributes\", which represent the properties of a class, or by \"methods\", which represent the different functions applicable to each object. our model was implemented with the support of the swarm platform <cit> and was developed in java language. the structure of our model, i.e. the relationships among classes, is described in figure <dig> this uml modeling shows the different parts of our model. a \"host\", which could be a vector or a reservoir individual, can host one \"parasite\" agent. all \"host\" objects are contained within a \"world\" object, which comprises the computing representation of that physical world. \"parasite\" agents are also contained within this \"world\" object. all these parts, and the most important functions and attributes used, will be detailed hereafter. parasite the \"parasite\" class includes different characteristics related only to the disease agent and the illness, such as \"infectious period\", \"latency period\" and \"virulence\". these features can be applied to both vector and reservoir species individuals. since disease characteristics are in reality a by-product of host and parasite life history-traits, this simplification leads to some limitations of the model, as we assume that parasite characteristics are exactly identical within vectors and reservoirs species. this approximation is acceptable for diseases with multiple vector and reservoir species if parasite's influences are similar among the different host species <cit> . however, this approximation needs to be reduced if we want to address disease transmission by different strains of a given parasite. since the main goal of the current work is to deal with a simple disease system without evolutionary dynamics, this issue will be discussed in the final \"examples of adaptability\" section. host the \"host\" class is the most important class in our model and has different groups of attributes. the first one concerns the geographic localization of individuals. hence, host contains \"x and \"y\" attributes that represent its geographical localization. for update purposes, we added also the \"future x\" and \"future y\" attributes, which contain future positions of a given host individual. these attributes will be dynamically updated over time. the second group concerns species characteristics that do not change over time. within this group, we can distinguish ecological life-history traits, such as \"offspring size\", \"lifespan\" and \"biting rate\", and spatial features, such as \"moving capacity\" and \"habitat tolerance\". \"moving capacity\" represents the area in pixels in which one host is allowed to move, and \"habitat tolerance\", a core parameter of our model, quantifies for each host species how far, in pixels, one host is allowed to diffuse outside its original habitat. to distinguish between vector and reservoir individuals, the \"biting rate\" attribute will be equal to \"-1\" for reservoir individuals and to the corresponding biting rate for vectors. this attribute is assumed to be constant for mosquito-borne pathogens, but it could evolve dynamically for tick-borne disease regarding the abundance of reservoir hosts involved. to study this kind of vector-borne pathogen, this attribute have to be replaced by a function involving the reservoir abundance. we could have distinguished two different \"vector\" and \"reservoir\" classes which inherit from the \"host\" class. however, we think that new classes inheriting from a super-class should be created only in the presence of certain conditions. the first case is when the number of inheriting classes is high or could be high. this is clearly not our case since only two classes are definitively needed. the second case is when the number of functions, which have to be inherited from a super-class, is high. in our case, only the function \"recovering\" would have to be developed differently and the function \"move\" partly in a different way. moreover, many functions of the \"model swarm\" class use general properties of the host and do not need to know whether a given individual is a vector or a reservoir. therefore, we chose to integrate \"vector\" and \"reservoir\" particularities into a single \"host\" class. finally, the \"index habitat\" and \"index species\" attributes are used for computational purposes. these different characteristics will be the same among all individuals within a given host species. however, a given \"index species\" could have links with different \"index habitats\" . as already said for the \"parasite\" class, host reactions against the parasite are not considered here, and all host-parasite interactions are accepted as being static in the \"parasite\" class but not for the \"competence\" parameter. this parameter is integrated into the \"host\" class and represents the probability for a host individual to become \"infectious\" after a contact with an \"infectious\" individual. landscape of habitats finally, landscape will be simply an array with the size of the virtual world. this array will be contained into a class, \"model swarm\", which contains different functions that impact on the landscape. this is an array of integer values that correspond to indexes of habitats that will be linked to the host's \"index habitat\" attribute. thus, with these two parameters, we can characterize the whole spatial distribution of the host species, and will be able to address any landscape configuration. this array could be assimilated to a picture that describes the category of habitats occurring at each pixel. dynamical interactions between components so far we have defined the static part of our model. now we need to address the dynamic interactions among all these attributes. indeed, each object will interact with all the others both in space and time using simple dynamical functions. to keep our model as simple as possible, we have modeled only three functions that are scheduled by a main algorithm and are implemented in the \"host\" class. host with landscape: moving function there are two options in the moving function. the first one is a basic type of movement and each individual has a given \"moving capacity\" that will allow that subject to move from its initial position to * 2) <dig> new locations. at each time step, a new position will be randomly selected. if it is not within the individual's habitat , the nearest position into the habitat will be then selected. we begin with movement with a square, but this function could be easily modified to take into account different behaviors. the other option concerns only the vectors. each vector individual has a \"biting rate\" which is converted into the probability of biting at each time step and is equal to 1/bitingrate when \"biting rate\" is expressed with the time step used in simulations. when this event is selected, the number of available reservoir individuals in * 2) <dig> possible positions is computed. a reservoir individual is then chosen randomly from a uniform distribution, and the vector will move to this selected position and bite the chosen reservoir individual for a potential transmission between vector and reservoir. host with parasite: infection function potential infection is the second function, and it could be involved at each time step. each individual, both from vector and reservoir species, has a \"competence\" value, which represents the probability that an individual becomes infectious after an infectious contact. hence, a random number will be generated according to a uniform law and, if this number is inferior to the \"competence value\", the \"next parasite\" field receives a \"parasite\" input. at each time step, \"current parasite\" has a 1/latencyperiod probability to receive the \"next parasite\" object if this object is not null. if successful, \"next parasite\" will receive a \"null\" value. similarly, at each time step, \"past parasite\" has a 1/infectiousperiod probability to receive a \"current parasite\" object. hence, the \"next parasite\", \"current parasite\" and \"past parasite\" fields will determine the infectious status as follows: if the three fields are \"null\", that individual is in the \"susceptible\" status; if \"next parasite\" is not null and the others are null, that subject is \"infected\", but not infectious if \"current parasite\" is not null and the others are null, the individual is \"infectious\" and can transmit the disease agent, and finally when \"past parasite\" is not null and the others are null, the individual is \"recovered\" and can not be infected again. host: birth and death functions the last important functions concern demography. each individual from a same species has an \"offspring size\" mean which represents the number of new hosts created at each birth event. to simplify, we assume that each \"host\" object has, on average, only one birth event during its life. hence, at each time step, there is a 1/lifespan probability that new \"offspring size\" \"host\" objects will be created for each individual. in the same way, individuals die with a probability equals to 1/lifespan at each time step. to keep our populations constant, as we assumed in the rest of this paper, we set \"offspring size\" to one. thus, on average, each host will produce one new host before its death. this assumption could be easily relaxed by adding a specific attribute representing a birth rate, which could be also a function to cope with dynamical demography. main algorithm finally, each individual has a main algorithm which schedules all the previously described different functions. this algorithm is split in two main functions: \"step\" and \"update\". the \"step\" function is called first. in this function, the \"move\" function will be applied for both vectors and reservoirs. for vector individuals, a search of available reservoir hosts will be launched only if the event \"bite\" is selected. only three fields can be modified during this function: \"future x\", \"future y\", and \"next parasite\". after \"step\" is done for all host individuals, the \"update\" function is applied to each individual. the \"x\" and \"y\" fields are filled by \"future x\" and \"future y\" respectively, the \"current parasite\" field by the \"future parasite\" value with a 1/latencyperiod probability. the \"past parasite\" field is filled by the \"current parasite\" value with a 1/infectiousperiod probability, and birth and death functions are called with 1/lifespan probability. all functions are detailed in the pseudo-code shown in additional file <dig> section <dig> all objects re filled from relevant case-studies. data format is explained in additional file <dig> section <dig> the most important point of the data format features remains its capacity to quantify for each habitat a different moving capacity for each vector and reservoir species, leading to the integration of heterogeneous environments. all parameters used in this model are summarized in table <dig> RESULTS adaptability examples: outcomes for modifying system studied to simplify the identification and modeling of the core mechanisms of our system, we have chosen a simple epidemiological context with only one vector species and one reservoir species in a landscape with some classes. however the main idea of our model is to be as general as possible. hence, we developed the possibility to integrate real data coming from real epidemiological situations. in this section, we propose three main additions to our basic model. the first one concerns the integration of maps from the geographical information system . this integration allows future studies to integrate real landscapes and to analyze how a pathogen agent can be transmitted within that landscape. however, often, landscapes from gis require very high resolution that could make impossible the computability of our model. to overcome this problem, we have integrated the implementation of a parallel behavior that transforms our model into a client/server software and allows us to distribute host objects to several computers. thus, the computability of our model will only depend on the number of available computers. parallelization makes our model suitable to be used to study disease transmission in really complex environments, and for that reason we can integrate also the last extension which concerns evolutionary dynamics. with the help of these three easy to implement additions, our model becomes a very adaptable tool for the analysis of a wide range of ecological and epidemiological situations. integration of data from a gis the way our model has been constructed allows data integration without additional developments. moreover, as most of the gis software integrate an output in raster format, we could fill in our habitats, which represent the \"virtual world\", with the values contained in the gis output file. this output should indicate values, in terms of habitat classification, for each pixel. then, as a last step, we would associate each habitat to each vector and reservoir species involved in our landscape. outcomes for intensive computing: parallelization when the number of individuals increases too much or when the space to be modeled is too detailed, like in the case of high-resolution maps, computing resources become quickly the limiting factor. to address this issue, we present here a parallel version of our model. this is a first version of parallelization which involves communication between different computers and does not accept a \"resume\" of the current simulation. thus different computers can be easily replaced by other chipsets just by substituting communication via \"socket\" by communication via internal memory. the introduction of a \"resume\" function in a future version of our model should integrate also a better management of unexpected events. similarly, implementing different moving behaviors requires to adapt the parallelization algorithm. this parallelization is quite simple and is based on a classical multi-thread client/server model. as all operations to access the \"virtual world\" are done by different functions in the \"model swarm mother\" class, we extended our model to two new classes which inherited from the first one . in the \"model swarm client\" class, each client contains a given number of individuals. these clients have also one thread to receive requests from the server. there are four synchronization messages for clients : \"go step\", which indicates that the client can launch the \"step\" function for each individual ; \"end step\" which is sent by the client to alert the server when all its individuals have completed the \"step\" function ; \"go update\" which is received by the client to launch the \"update\" function for all its individuals and \"end update\" which is sent by the client to indicate to the server that a given time step is completed for that client. in the \"model swarm server\" class, upon loading of a gis file, each new individual is assigned to the less busy client . afterward, a thread is created for communication with each client using the described synchronization messages. when clients need to know some characteristics about one neighboring host or about the habitat value of a given pixel, the server receives a message indicating which value is wanted. a communication protocol has been developed and it is described in additional file <dig> section <dig> this implementation underlines the capacity of an oriented-object program. indeed, the \"model swarm alone\" class is used in the case of a non-parallel model. this class inherits from the \"model swarm mother\" class and it is filled only with \"virtual functions\" that allow accessing the virtual world or managing task scheduling. these virtual functions will be developed differently for a stand-alone execution, a server execution or a client execution. in this way, we know that the model behavior has not been modified upon parallelization because it is implemented in the host class and only functions of scheduling and space access can be modified in the parallel version. integration of evolutionary dynamics so far, evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite interactions in real landscapes have been poorly studied. however, our model could easily cope with this additional complexity. to integrate evolutionary insights, we have to relax the assumption that all disease characteristics are contained in the \"parasite\" class. therefore, we have to model the infection process as a by-product between the host and the parasite. to do that, we have integrated the theoretical framework proposed by girvan and collaborators <cit> to study pathogen evolution. accordingly, we represented the pathogen and host genomes as binary strings with a length n for the pathogen genome and with a longer string for the host genome. we then computed the hamming's distance between the two strings to measure the adequation between host and pathogen, and hence the probability of infection. if we then integrate a mutation rate to the pathogen's genome, applied at each new infection, we can also study the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens in space and time. finally, if we apply also a mutation rate to the host's genome at each new birth, we can analyze the co-evolutionary dynamics as well. this last extension shows once again the adaptability of our model. just by modifying the \"infection\" function and with a conceptual representation of the host and parasite genomes, we can analyze a wide range of evolutionary dynamics in space and time, for and within different vector and reservoir species in a real landscape. CONCLUSIONS the model we describe in this paper is one of the simplest for vector-borne diseases. this simplicity, which leads to a model comparable to the classical seir stochastic model, allows us to analyze the core mechanisms involved in the spatial features of vector-borne disease dynamics. the analysis of these spatial features show that the spatio-temporal dynamics of vector species are a crucial factor for disease understanding. moreover, to decrease the intensity of disease transmission, a drastic reduction of vectors' moving capacity has to be applied to produce a significant effect on disease patterns. the high flexibility of our model allowed us to easily integrate data coming from gis, thus moving away from theoretical studies to handle real-life situations. however, since real situations need often high-resolution gis, we have developed a parallel version of our model to cope with all kinds of epidemiological situations. finally, to strengthen our model's adaptability, we integrated a simple way to study evolutionary and co-evolutionary dynamics. of course, our model is not the \"magic model\" that could be used to model anything, any time and anywhere. nevertheless, the dramatic increase of vector-borne diseases <cit> , such west nile fever, lyme disease, chickungunya or others, strongly justifies the generation of this kind of models for a better understanding of complex-system diseases. these theoretical developments have to be continued to fully appreciate the overall impact of spatial features on disease dynamics. other spatial modeling methods could be applied as well. the most used model in vector-borne diseases is the reaction-diffusion framework that is really attractive for simple cases. however, when landscape is highly fragmented and the diversity of local habitats could impact on the moving capacity of vector species, tractability of this model could become a problem. moreover, if the disease studied involves several vector and reservoir species, the number of equations then becomes a critical issue. this limitation also exists for the metapopulation and network models. hence, the most generic model is probably represented by an individual-based model such as the one we have developed in the present work. our main goal is to provide a generic and highly customizable model for vector-borne diseases. its structure could be applied on a wide range of vector-borne disease, but the different functions and attributes have to be updated to study specific cases. but our model opens new opportunities for the study of infectious diseases. as mathematical epidemiology builds on seir framework, we hope that our study has underlined how computational biology could be also well applied to the study of vector-borne diseases. our model, freely accessible on under gpl license, is proposed as a first standard version. this model could, and should, be improved to increase the interest in the study of spatio-temporal dynamics of vector-borne diseases in realistic situations. availability and requirements project name: tinain project home page: operating system: platform independent programming language: java other requirements: swarm platform license: gnu gpl authors' contributions br participated to study conception, carried out the model programming, carried out the analysis of the model and drafted the manuscript. jfg participated to study conception and improved the manuscript. fb participated to study conception, model analysis and improved the manuscript. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. supplementary material additional file 1 supplementary informations. biological analyses explained in the main text, all algorithms of the model, procedure for input files loading and communication protocol for distributed behavior. click here for file acknowledgements we sincerely acknowledge different colleagues which reviewed this manuscript and helped to its improvement. in particular, we thank roman biek, scott duke-sylvester, leslie a. real and marc choisy for their helpful comments. br and jfg are sponsored by the institut de recherche pour le développement and the centre national de la recherche scientifique, and are supported by the eden project . this publication is catalogued by the eden steering committee as eden <dig> . the contents of this publication are the sole responsibility of the authors and don't necessarily reflect the views of the european commission. fb is sponsored by the centre international de recherche agronomique pour le développement.",

RESULTS active genes involved in growth research on m. tuberculosis has yet to answer the questions of how many and what genes are active during normal growth in a standard in vitro environment and how they are related to each other in a global genome-wide sense. to answer these questions, we adopted the affymetrix genechip system, which, based on a specific oligonucleotide array format, could provide the absolute signal intensity in a single condition as well as the signal ratio between two conditions. furthermore, its built-in statistical algorithm computes the so-called detection p-value that determines the presence or absence of any given mrna. it is this feature that we capitalize on to explore the genomic behavior of m. tuberculosis. a gene is active when it is expressed. gene activity is measured by the expression level detected by microarray hybridization in this study. we found that about one-half of the genes in m. tuberculosis genome participated in bacterial growth during the log phase in standard broth culture. the average and standard deviation of expression signal intensity for each active gene would reflect its relative level of activity and the range of variation . it was noted that the extent of gene expression did not necessarily correlated with essentiality; for example, among the ten most expressed genes, only two were essential genes as defined by high density mutagenesis <cit> . functional genomic analysis the microarray data of those genes involved in the in vitro growth of m. tuberculosis during log phase were analyzed through the hierarchical clustering algorithm of eisen's cluster program <cit> . this cluster-analysis program allowed us to explore the internal structure of the data and derive useful information concerning the coordination and collaboration among the genes. a measure fundamental to clustering is that of similarity. we define similarity between genes by their correlation in terms of gene expression patterns across multiple samples. the dendrogram generated by the algorithm was organized according to this measure and displayed in a way to optimize the similarity of adjacent elements . in the dendrogram, more related genes were joined earlier, and several highly dense clusters with peaks spreading along were visible. based upon the above analysis, the dendrogram was partitioned, using a correlation threshold of <dig> , into a number of disjoint clusters related to functional classes known previously. each cluster contained functionally related genes that might share similar functions or roles in physiology or metabolism and were likely subject to the same regulatory mechanism. for instance, one cluster was found to be similar to the fas-ii operon, and another cluster comprised largely of genes encoding ribosomal proteins . notice, however, genes of different classes may co-exist in the same cluster if they show correlation in their activity. this situation is exemplified by energy-dependent transportation across cell membrane, which necessitates the coupling between the gene class of cell processes and that of energy production. the clustering results were further visualized through eisen's treeview program to generate a heat map where the brightness of the red color represented the intensity of gene expression . based on the cluster analysis results and the observation of four conspicuous shining bands, the map was tentatively divided into four zones from the top to the bottom, called: zones <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> in the consecutive order. each zone contained clusters of genes that were strongly correlated in their expression patterns and in that sense, functionally related. each zone in the map was represented by genes that expressed most , thus, the map zones were labeled according to the functional class of their representative genes as \"intermediate and lipid metabolism\", \"energy\", \"information\", and \"cell wall, cell processes, and metabolism\", respectively. the two most conspicuous clusters in the first zone of the gene expression map consisted of a cluster represented by genes in the functional category of intermediate metabolism, such as cysh, ggtb, and nira, and the other cluster represented by genes involved in the fas-ii cycle <cit> , such as accd <dig> kasa, and kasb. the formation of the cluster with emphasis on the fas-ii cycle reflects the importance of this pathway in m. tuberculosis growth. as for intermediate metabolism, m. tuberculosis can metabolize many kinds of carbohydrates, hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones and carboxylic acids <cit> . this zone was adjacent to the energy zone, suggesting the close relationship between intermediate metabolism and energy production. the most prominent genes in the second zone of the gene expression map were the atp synthase gene complex, which produces atp from adp and is critical in energy metabolism. in addition, genes encoding enzymes involved in the respiratory chain, such as the nuo gene complex, were clustered into this zone. in another study <cit> , atp synthase and nuo gene complexes were found to be down-regulated together. thus, they may be co-regulated. the third zone of the gene expression map was represented by genes involved in the information pathways, e.g., dnaq , reca , rpoa , and the 30s and 50s ribosome protein gene complexes . as these genes play a vital role in genetic information replication, transcription, and translation, their expression is essential for maintaining bacterial growth. we noticed that the gene rv2258c correlated well with a group of ribosomal protein genes. this result is related to a report that the production of ribosomes is increased through the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins during the growth phase of yeast <cit> . the last zone of the gene expression map was represented by genes classified under the category of cell wall, cell processes, and metabolism. this category comprises membrane proteins and proteins involved in cell processes, including secreted and transmembrane proteins <cit> , as well as enzymes involved in intermediate metabolism. genes and their protein derivatives located in this zone are related to cell wall synthesis, transportation of organic and inorganic substance across membrane, and immunological responses, such as nark <dig> , fbpc , hsp , ald , ctpf , soda , ompa , amt , fura , fbpb , and genes in the lipoprotein family . the most important feature of mycobacterial cell wall is the substantial amount of lipid components, particularly, the very long chain mycolic acids, which are combined with surface glycolipids to form a pseudolipid bilayer <cit> . since the cell wall synthesis involves lipid metabolism <cit> , the main cluster in zone <dig> also contains some genes in this class, such as fade <dig> and fadd <dig> . each zone was tentatively named according to the most expressed genes it contained. the semantics of each zone would further depend on whether each zone represents a concentration of genes in the same functional categories and that concentration is consistent with the function classification of the most expressed genes in that zone. so we further analyzed the percentage distribution of functional classes for the genes in the major clusters of each zone on the gene expression map . the functional classification of a gene is based on current knowledge in the field and can be accessed from the tuberculist server . our analysis indicated that each zone contained clusters of genes of similar functions and the most expressed genes were in the dominant function class, suggesting that functional semantics can be assigned to clusters visible from the gene expression map. zone- <dig> featured genes in the functional classes of metabolism . in zone- <dig> there was only a slight dominance of genes in the class of metabolism and respiration over the class of cell wall and processes, but notably, it contained a big chuck of energy-related genes involved in atp synthesis and electron transport. zone- <dig> was characterized by genes in the information category. zone- <dig> had the broadest distribution on the map and a wide functional coverage, and was thus least characteristic among the four zones. there were about a dozen of regulatory genes associated with the major functional clusters identified in this study . their significance is reflected by their possible roles reported in other studies. these genes likely regulate other genes in the same cluster at the transcriptional level and deserve to be examined in more details. regulatory genes associated with small clusters are considered less important and hence not examined here. the rv <dig> gene was associated with the cluster characterized by energy metabolism and respiration in our data. the association relation appears to be consistent with reports that this gene is up-regulated at high temperatures <cit> and down-regulated after starvation <cit> . rv <dig> was up-regulated at high temperatures <cit> as well as after starvation <cit> . this gene is probably in the merr family and its protein is similar to many regulatory proteins in sequence. rv <dig> can be induced by hypoxia <cit> . its presence in growing bacterial cells is called into question. however, this gene is only weakly expressed in the present study, and likely to be up-regulated if oxygen is depleted. the whib <dig> gene encodes a protein homologous to a streptomyces sporulation factor <cit> , and the gene is up-regulated after starvation <cit> , suggesting a possible link between starvation and sporulation. in addition, the association of whib <dig> with the class of cell wall and cell processes makes sense from the point that sporulation could potentially involve cell membrane. rv0653c is probably in the tetr family. its significance is reflected by the fact that proteins in this family are involved in the transcriptional control of multi-drug efflux pumps and pathogenicity <cit> . another regulatory gene, rv0165c, is probably in the gntr family. in e. coli, gntr regulates gluconate uptake and catabolism as a repressor <cit> . both rv0653c and rv0165c are apparently involved in a membrane-associated cellular process. another gene worth attention is rv1931c, which regulates genes important for virulence of m. tuberculosis <cit> , possibly via a cellular process that translates extracellular stimuli into a transcriptional signal. discussion the availability of the complete genome sequence of mycobacterium tuberculosis <cit> combined with rapidly emerging microarray technology <cit> has catalyzed the process of understanding the bacterial biology and pathogenicity and expedited the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics for tuberculosis. the microarray approach has enabled high-throughput gene expression analysis on a genomic scale in a field known as functional genomics <cit> . in particular, elucidation of functional relationships among genes based on genome-wide gene expression data from dna microarray hybridization has been successfully demonstrated for eukaryotes, notably yeast <cit> , but it has not been done for m. tuberculosis. to date, the functional classification of genes in m. tuberculosis is mainly based on the biological study of individual genes as well as sequence analysis and comparison with homologous genes in other bacteria. in this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis that addresses this issue from the perspective of functional genomics. in the application to m. tuberculosis, dna microarrays have been used for comparing species, detecting drug-resistant mutants, and studying biological behavior under various conditions. in general, there are two computational paradigms for microarray data analysis. the first paradigm is to identify genes differentially expressed across two conditions; the second paradigm is to identify genes expressed in a coordinated manner that share common roles in cellular physiology or metabolism. most of the applications for m. tuberculosis to date are based on the first paradigm, whereas our study described here is based on the second paradigm. in this study, active genes were identified by means of the affymetrix genechip. as its unique feature, the affymetrix system uses multiple oligonucleotide probes for implementing each gene sequence to be interrogated. furthermore, the system is capable of analyzing the presence or absence of each mrna. in contrast to the cdna microarray system that is focused on differential gene expression across two conditions, the affymetrix system can calculate gene expression in a single condition and compare gene expression across multiple conditions. in this way, the affymetrix system is more flexible and informative. the flexibility can be attributed to the use of pm/mm probes, instead of two explicitly defined external conditions, for implementing the test/control mechanism in microarray hybridization. our method for analysis of in vitro genomic activity of m. tuberculosis can be extended to study functional genomics in vivo. understanding what genes are switched on or off between in vitro and in vivo conditions would shed light on issues, such as how biological adaptation leads to bacterial latency, why there is discrepancy between laboratory sensitivity and clinical efficacy, and so on. thus, the functional-genomics data obtained in this work can serve as a reference for interpreting data generated in other contexts. our genomic analysis was based on multiple rna samples extracted during log-phase growth in contrast to other coordinated gene expression analyses based on samples collected in a time course or under different conditions. our experiment design is justified, given the fact that the expression level of any gene has considerable fluctuation from time to time in log-phase growth, as evidenced from the observation that the standard deviation of a gene expression was sometimes greater than 50% of its mean across samples. variation in gene expression across different time settings enabled the correlation among different genes to be analyzed. the validity of our experiments is supported by reconfirmation of several known growth-related gene clusters. however, our approach is not applicable to samples collected during stationary phase, when little variation in gene expression is expected across samples. the in vitro broth culture condition has often been used as the reference condition to study the gene expression of m. tuberculosis in other conditions, such as hypoxia and starvation. however, the present study is the first to explore the functional genomics of this organism grown in log-phase culture. bacterial growth can be divided into four different phases: lag phase, exponential or log phase, stationary phase, and death phase. it is the log phase that we focused our study on. during this phase, high growth activity is evidenced by our data showing that about half of the genes in the genome were expressed. in contrast, many genes in m. tuberculosis are repressed during the stationary phase, a condition similar to but milder than the non-replicating state of tubercle bacilli in an anaerobic condition <cit> . in particular, the dormancy regulatory gene, dosr is weakly induced during the stationary phase while strongly induced in an anaerobic non-replicating state. an interesting finding based on our work is that dosr is always moderately expressed even in the log phase, suggesting its possible housekeeping role. our data further showed that an important gene, acr , which is induced under hypoxia <cit> and starvation <cit> , was always expressed in the log phase. global gene expression profiling analysis of m. tuberculosis in mouse <cit> and human tissue <cit> indicated that lipid metabolism was critical for the bacilli to survive in the host environment. in these conditions, isocitrate lyase , an enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt and related to mycobacterial persistence in macrophages <cit> , is up-regulated. it is consistent with our finding that icl is weakly expressed or absent in the log-phase culture. the extent to which gene expression profiles across a set of independently collected samples suffice to separate genes into functional clusters in consistency with prior knowledge is attributable to the rigorous statistical model built in the affymetrix system. several familiar gene groups with clear designated functions, such as electron transport, protein synthesis and type ii fatty acid synthesis, were observed in the data, offering credence to our analysis. however, genes associated with different functional classes would be placed in the same cluster if they appear to co-express. this implies that genes can share commons roles while differing in their functions, as illustrated by the earlier example of energy-dependent transportation across the cell membrane. in fact, comparing gene clusters based on gene expression with gene classes based on sequence analysis would offer new opportunities for re-defining interrelationships among genes in the genome. gene clusters built out of expression profiles can be configured as functional linkage networks among genes but these clusters do not correspond directly to protein networks <cit> constructed using a combination of rosetta stone, phylogenetic profile, conserved gene neighbor, and operon computational methods. genes, which share similar biological functions, may operate at different stages of the cell cycle or become active under different conditions, and hence have different expression profiles <cit> . however, some gene families, in particular those encoding ribosome proteins are closely linked in both gene-expression and protein networks, as seen in our data. there remained <dig> so-called conserved hypothetical genes/proteins annotated in the genome sequence of m. tuberculosis <cit> , among which many were found to be active in our analysis, attesting to the predictive power of the genome annotation program <cit> . more importantly, this finding suggests that many hypothetical proteins actively participate in the growth process. unfortunately, the functions of these hypotheticals remain uncharacterized, reflecting the limitation of the sequence-based approach to genome annotation. microarray-based functional-genomics offers a fundamentally different approach to gene annotation, in which the roles of uncharacterized genes may be hypothesized if they co-express with known genes . organized according to correlations in gene expression across samples, the gene expression image created by eisen's cluster and treeview programs enabled us to visualize four transcriptional profiles, which, named according to the functional classes of the dominant genes in that region and put in a linear order over the image, were \"intermediate and lipid metabolism\", \"energy and respiration\", \"information pathways\", and \"cell wall, cell processes and metabolism\". the dendrogram was constructed and displayed so that similar clusters were likely to be located in proximate nodes. in the present application, as the similarity measure is based on the correlation in gene expression, physical distance on the tree reflects the degree of correlation among gene clusters, even with no guarantee of their optimal linear ordering in the tree <cit> . as the expression of the genetic code lies at the heart of all physiological processes and metabolisms, it is logical that the information gene cluster functionally correlates with other gene clusters, a view supported by the observation that it was situated around the center of the image. as it is now, there are more than <dig> transcriptional regulatory genes in m. tuberculosis genome <cit> . however, only a fraction of them have been experimentally studied in detail for their functions. a recent survey shows that regulatory proteins account for <dig> out of <dig> virulence factors identified in m. tuberculosis <cit> . unraveling the gene regulatory network would allow us to understand both physiological and virulence mechanisms and to develop novel drugs that work at the level of gene regulation. since elucidating the roles of these genes and their clinical relevance is always time-consuming; it is practically necessary to set up priority for them. a reasonable assumption is that a regulatory gene regulates some other genes in the same functional cluster with a high probability. under this assumption, we have identified several potentially important transcriptional regulatory genes involved in major biological pathways . their significance has been indicated by analysis based on the literature. further biological investigation on these genes is warranted in the future work. all the microarray data and supplementary materials produced in this study are posted at our web site . CONCLUSIONS genes involved in the in vitro log-phase growth of m. tuberculosis have been identified. the gene expression map represents broad patters of functional concordance of closely related genes, but more importantly, it summarizes the coordinated cellular activities associated with the growth process on the genomic level. as it is today, hundreds of genes in the genome are annotated as conserved hypotheticals without clearly specified functions. our data have shown that more than <dig> such hypotheticals were actually expressed in the cell medium, and their biological roles can be suggested by their correlation with other known genes. in addition, the roles of most transcriptional regulatory genes predicted in the genome remain to be elucidated. in this study, we have discovered several regulatory genes that may exert regulatory influence on the growth of m. tuberculosis, and their roles may be inferred by what functional clusters they join. the data and information generated here provide an integrated genomic view about gene functions and interrelationships in m. tuberculosis, and can be incorporated in new experiments for research in tuberculosis. this study has not only transcriptionally validated several known gene clusters but also provided insight into a host of unknown hypothetical and regulatory genes.",

    "prompt": "Write a summary of the research hypothesis and results. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND recombinant serum albumins provide an attractive scaffold for the delivery of attached therapeutic peptides or proteins <cit> . they are the most abundant proteins in the plasma of mammals, reaching concentrations of 40- <dig> mg/ml in humans <cit> . they are slowly cleared plasma proteins <cit> whose longevity in the circulation derives from a well-characterized mechanism of recycling via the major histocompatibility complex-related fc receptor for immunoglobulin g <cit> . serum albumin is also unusual among plasma proteins in that it is not glycosylated <cit> , a property that simplifies its recombinant expression and production <cit> . if candidate therapeutic peptides or proteins can be fused to albumin in a manner that allows them to express their endogenous activity, the resulting fusion protein often demonstrates improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties due to acquisition of albumin-like circulatory characteristics <cit> . for these reasons, albumin has been fused to numerous proteins such as interferon <cit> , interleukin- <dig> <cit> , butrylcholinesterase <cit> , coagulation factors vii <cit> and ix <cit> , hirudin <cit> , and barbourin <cit> , as well as to smaller peptides <cit> . in order to address unmet clinical needs in the area of thrombosis, the pathological formation of clots within intact blood vessels, our laboratory previously investigated novel recombinant proteins comprised of portions of α2-antiplasmin fused to the n-terminus of human serum albumin <cit> . α2ap is cross-linked to fibrin clots by activated factor xiii , where it promotes clot stability by inhibiting the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin <cit> . we <cit> and others <cit> have demonstrated that competing α2ap-fibrin crosslinking results in fibrin clots that are more easily dissolved in vitro, suggesting potential applications of such competitors as adjuncts to thrombolytic therapy. previously, we attempted expression of three α2ap-hsa fusion proteins in pichia pastoris, a methylotropic yeast shown to produce recombinant hsa in high yield and with indistinguishable biophysical properties to its plasma-derived counterpart <cit> . our strategy was to retain the n-terminal sites of α2ap-fibrin crosslinking, especially q <dig> <cit> , but to delete the c-terminal plasmin-binding and plasmin-trapping reactive centre loop of this serpin-type inhibitor. we sought to provide as native a protein environment as possible for the α2ap cross-linking motif by maximizing the portion of α2ap fused to hsa. however, only a chimeric protein comprised of α2ap residues 13- <dig> fused to hsa was secreted by the yeast; the two longer fusions involving residues 13- <dig> and 13- <dig> were not stably expressed. moreover, α2ap-hsa was partially proteolyzed within its α2ap moiety. while we demonstrated that α2ap-hsa became a substrate of fxiiia and competed for α2ap crosslinking to both small and macromolecular substrates, we could not demonstrate cross-linking to clots in vivo above background levels seen with recombinant hsa <cit> . in the present study, we sought to improve the ability of hsa fusion proteins to compete with α2ap for fxiiia-mediated cross-linking. the α2ap moiety was reduced to <dig> residues , to avoid previously observed sites of proteolysis by p. pastoris proteases, and compared to two 12-residue artificial fxiiia substrate peptides selected by phage display for high reactivity <cit> . these motifs were expressed with or without n-terminal his tags, to allow for purification of full length proteins away from partially proteolyzed products. we hypothesized that replacing α2ap 13- <dig> with shorter, potentially more active fxiiia substrate motifs would improve the stability of fibrin cross-linkable hsa proteins and improve in vivo clot retention. methods dna manipulations all oligonucleotides employed in this study were synthesized at mobix lab, a mcmaster university core facility. the sequences of all plasmids generated in this study were validated by dna sequencing, also performed by mobix lab, prior to use for protein expression. standard molecular biological protocols for dna restriction and ligation, plasmid mini-dna preparation, purification of dna from agarose gels, and transformation of e. coli top <dig> to ampicillin resistance, were employed <cit> . three plasmids encoding fusion proteins xl4-, xl5-, and xl6-hsa were first prepared, by analogous means. synthetic oligonucleotides, whose sequences are shown in table <dig> were first annealed by heating to 95°c and slow cooling to room temperature, in pairs, for each construct, respectively: ml-08- <dig> and ml-08-5117; ml-08- <dig> and ml-08-5119; and ml-08- <dig> and ml-ml-08- <dig> annealed oligonucleotides were then separately ligated to the <dig> bp xhoi-kpni restriction digestion fragment of previously described plasmid ppicz9ss-α2ap-hsah <dig> <cit> , replacing the α2ap codons, forming plasmids ppicz9ss-xl#-hsah <dig> where # corresponds to <dig> <dig> or <dig> respectively. in order to construct xl-hsa constructs in which the his tag was not present on the c-terminus of the hsa moiety, an intermediate construct was prepared. a full-length preprohsa cdna in pcdna <dig> , pc3pphsa, was restricted with xbai and apai, and the <dig> bp minor fragment was ligated to the major <dig> bp xbai-apai fragment of ppicz9ss-α2ap-hsah <dig> yielding plasmid ppicz9ss-α2ap-hsa, in which the hsa open reading frame terminated without hexahistidine codons. the <dig> bp xhoi-kpni restriction fragment of ppicz9ss-α2ap-hsa was then combined with the following pair-wise annealed oligonucleotides: ml-08- <dig> and ml-08-5105; ml-08- <dig> and ml-08-5107; and ml-08- <dig> and ml-08- <dig> this approach yielded plasmids ppicz9ss-xl#-hsah <dig> where # corresponds to <dig> <dig> or <dig> respectively. a final expression plasmid was constructed to reverse the orientation of the his tag of fusion protein α2ap-hsah <dig> <cit> . plasmid pbad-h6-α2ap <cit> was pcr-amplified using oligonucleotides ml 09- <dig> and <dig> <cit> , and the <dig> bp xhoi-kpni restriction fragment of the resulting pcr product was inserted between the corresponding sites of ppicz9ss-α2ap-hsa to yield ppicz9ss-h6α2ap-hsa. each completed plasmid listed above was used to transform pichia pastoris strain x <dig> to zeocin resistance as previously described <cit> . fusion protein expression, purification, and characterization hsa fusion proteins were purified from media conditioned by transformed pichia pastoris cells and induced with <dig> % vol/vol methanol, as previously described <cit> , except that the methanol induction phase of protein production was extended to <dig> hours. at that point, the conditioned media was neutralized and clarified by centrifugation <cit> , treated with protease inhibitors , and purified using ni-nta agarose chromatography . purified proteins were analyzed by sds-page and immunoblotting using polyclonal affinity-purified goat anti-human α2ap antibodies and murine monoclonal anti-hsa antibodies . they were also characterized by automated edman degradation at the advanced protein technology centre of the hospital for sick children, toronto, canada. transglutamination assays with biotinylated pentylamine in order to quantify fxiiia-catalyzed transglutamination of plasma-derived α2ap and recombinant hsa fusion proteins, a microtiter plate protocol was developed. test hsa-related proteins were first incubated for varying times in tris-buffered saline containing <dig> mm cacl <dig> and <dig> mm biotinylated pentylamine supplemented with <dig> nm human fxiii and <dig> iu/ml human thrombin . reactions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of <dig> mm edta ph <dig> and transferred to microtiter plates. microtiter plates were prepared for use by coating with <dig> μg/ml mouse anti-hsa monoclonal antibody in <dig> mm sodium carbonate ph <dig> overnight at 4°c. all other incubations were at room temperature. all washes were performed with tris-buffered saline supplemented with <dig> % tween <dig> , and repeated three times. anti-hsa-coated plates were washed and then blocked for one hour in tbst, then washed again. following transfer of the stopped transglutamination reaction mixtures to the plate, it was incubated with shaking for one hour and washed, prior to reaction of captured proteins with a 1: <dig> dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin in tbst for one hour. following a final wash step, colour was developed by addition of <dig> mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt in diethanolamine buffer and absorbance was quantified on an elx <dig> plate reader at <dig> nm for up to <dig> minutes. in some reactions, the protocol was modified to measure transglutamination of α2ap by substituting anti-α2ap antibodies for anti-hsa antibodies, and purified human plasma-derived α2ap for hsa-related proteins. transglutamination of fibrin fxiiia-catalyzed transglutamination of the natural substrate fibrinogen was assessed using sds-page and immunoblotting of cross-linking reactions as previously described <cit> . briefly, <dig> nm fxiii was first activated to fxiiia by reaction with <dig> iu/ml thrombin for <dig> minutes at 37°c; thrombin was then inactivated using phe-pro-arg chloromethylketone to <dig> μm final concentration, to prevent clotting on addition to fibrinogen. the resulting fxiiia was reacted with <dig> μm human fibrinogen , and <dig> μm substrate proteins in tbs containing <dig> mm cacl <dig> reactions were stopped by addition of sds and analyzed on 8% sds-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, with immunoblotting and chemiluminescent development of antibody-decorated blots, as described <cit> . in vitro clot lysis as previously described <cit> , the formation and dissolution of human plasma clots was followed by recording changes in turbidity, using an elx <dig> plate reader set to take absorbance readings at <dig> nm every <dig> seconds for <dig> hours, and quantified as the area under the curve. retention of iodinated proteins in mouse vena cava treated with ferric chloride purified human fibrinogen , human α2ap , or xl5-hsa recombinant proteins were iodinated using the iodogen method as described by the manufacturer , using either sodium 125i or 131i. unincorporated radioactivity was removed by exhaustive dialysis versus phosphate-buffered saline. specific activities of labelling exceeded <dig> × <dig> cpm/mg. radioiodinated proteins were then tested in the mouse ferric chloride vena cava thrombosis model, modified from <cit> . cd- <dig> mice were anaesthetized using gaseous anaesthesia at all times during this procedure, and a heating pad was employed to ensure maintenance of normal body temperature. a mid-line incision was made, first through the skin and secondly through the muscle layer. viscera were gently displaced and haemostatic clamps employed to keep the incision open. at this time radioiodinated proteins were injected via the tail vein. the vena cava was then exposed and a <dig> × <dig> mm piece of whatman paper soaked in 10% ferric chloride was applied. the viscera were covered with gauze soaked in warm saline during this time. the time from radioactive protein injection to application of ferric chloride was fixed at <dig> minutes. three minutes after its application, the filter paper was removed and viscera replaced. thirty minutes later, the vena cava was re-exposed, the vessel was excised, and the clot was transferred to a tared tube for weighing, and then subjected to γ counting using either an auto gamma <dig> minaxi γ counter or a cobra ii γ counter to quantify incorporated radioactivity. retention of iodinated proteins in rabbit jugular vein thrombi new zealand white rabbits were subjected to a modified wessler procedure <cit> as previously described by this laboratory <cit> . briefly, animals were initially anesthetized with <dig> mg of ketamine, then maintained in the anesthetized state with <dig> % isoflurane. they were then cannulated via the carotid artery and the jugular veins isolated. one ml of whole blood was freshly drawn and anticoagulated with 1/9th volume of <dig> % w/vol sodium citrate. two centimeter long sections of the right and left jugular veins were isolated, emptied of blood, and isolated using bulldog clamps. clotting of the anticoagulated, autologous whole blood was initiated by combining it with warm human thromboplastin reagent thromborel s in a 1: <dig> ratio, supplementing it to <dig> × <dig> cpm/ml 131i- fibrinogen and 125i-recombinant protein, and re-introducing <dig> ml of the clotting blood into the isolated segments. this was done for both isolated jugular veins and blood flow was held in stasis for <dig> minutes, at which time the clamps were removed, and blood flow restored. clots were recovered <dig> minutes later, following jugular vein opening by incision, and removed, weighed, and γ-counted as described above for murine clots. in some experiments clots were extracted overnight in <dig> m urea, microcentrifuged, and the supernatant removed prior to re-counting. the proportion of urea-stable protein incorporation was then calculated, adjusted for radioactive decay between the recorded times of the first and second γ-count. all animal experiments were carried out under the terms of an approved animal utilization protocol reviewed, approved, and monitored by the animal research ethics board of the faculty of health sciences, mcmaster university. statistical analysis statistical tests were performed using graphpad instat version <dig> . multiple comparisons used one-way parametric analysis of variation with tukey-kramer post-tests where data were normally distributed, and nonparametic anova with dunn's post-tests where they were not. RESULTS expression and characterization of fusion proteins media conditioned by pichia pastoris cultures transformed with expression plasmids encoding fusion proteins xl-hsa were first screened for recombinant expression of hsa-related polypeptides by gel analysis. as shown in figure 2a, although there were some differences in the time course of expression, five of six of the yeast cell lines secreted a major methanol-dependent polypeptide of the expected size of the hsa fusion proteins, of 70- <dig> kda. the exception was the cell line programmed to express xl3-hsa, which secreted no detectable methanol-dependent polypeptides. the five putative hsa fusion proteins were purified from conditioned media induced with methanol for <dig> hours, using nickel chelate affinity chromatography, and reacted both with anti-hsa and anti-hexahistidine antibodies, as shown in figure 2b. the same properties were observed for h6α2ap-hsa and previously described α2ap-hsa <cit> . similar results were obtained when an additional two independent p. pastoris zeocin-resistant cell lines were examined, in addition to the ones shown in figure <dig> . because the minor, 2- <dig> kda difference between the shortest and longest -hsa) putative expression proteins was not resolvable on the gel system we employed, we sought independent confirmation of the identity and integrity of the expressed protein products by amino acid sequencing. for xl-hsa, a single n-terminal sequence was detected by edman degradation: nqeqvs; dqmmlp; and wqhkid, respectively. for xl1-hsa and xl2-hsa, edman degradation showed intact hexahistidine amino-termini. for h6α2ap-hsa, two sequences were detected: the major sequence arising from the expected hexahistidine tag, and the other a mixture of amino acids suggestive of a similar pattern of partial proteolysis we previously reported for α2ap-hsa <cit> . in that regard, batches of the latter protein were prepared using <dig> hours of methanol induction, as employed for all other proteins in this study, for consistency and for comparative purposes. edman degradation showed a mixture of termini similar to those previously observed from cultures induced for lesser periods of time <cit> . these included termini commencing with leu <dig> , leu <dig> , and ser <dig> but no detectable full-length product. three separate batches of such protein preparations returned similar results . while the amino acid sequencing results showed that positioning of a hexahistidine tag on the n-terminus of α2ap-hsa improved the integrity of the resulting purified protein product, the yield was reduced from 40- <dig> mg/l for ap-hsa to 5- <dig> mg/l for h6α2ap-hsa. yields for the purified xl-hsa proteins varied from 10- <dig> mg/l to 20- <dig> mg/l to 80- <dig> mg/l . characterization of recombinant fusion proteins as fxiiia substrates for cross-linking to lysine donors having demonstrated that all recombinant fusion proteins with the exception of xl3-hsa had been produced, we next asked whether the addition of the candidate fxiiia sequences had actually converted the proteins into substrates for cross-linking by fxiiia. cross-linking reactions were performed in solution, using the chemical amine donor biotinylated pentylamine, and reaction products were captured using antibodies immobilized on microtiter plate walls and quantified colorimetrically using alkaline-phosphatase-linked streptavidin. as shown in figure 3a, while there was evidence of some cross-linking for all proteins tested, the highest levels were observed for fusion proteins xl5-hsa and xl2-hsa, in that order. while the results shown in figure 3a were limited to initial reactions, by five minutes the cross-linking of xl2-hsa and xl5-hsa had become comparable . similar results were obtained when hsa fusion proteins were employed as competitors of the fxiiia-dependent transfer of biotin from bpa to α2ap, which exhibited time-dependent crosslinking on the time scale employed . as shown in figure 3c, of seven proteins tested using a seven-fold excess of competitor over α2ap, only xl5-hsa, xl2-hsa, and h6α2ap-hsa significantly reduced cross-linking of α2ap; the relative efficacy of the proteins was in the order listed. to minimize the possibility that reactivity with bpa was an artefact that did not accurately predict reactivity with macromolecular donors, the ability of xl5-hsa to be cross-linked to fibrinogen was tested. as shown in figure <dig> xl5-hsa and α2ap exhibited similar kinetics in forming high molecular weight products with fibrinogen that were dependent on added fxiiia, although the fact that different antibodies, with potentially different binding efficiency, had to be employed limited the comparison to a qualitative assessment. a similar pattern was observed for both proteins in that three higher molecular weight bands of <dig> kda and greater formed in a factor xiiia- and fibrinogen-dependent manner; with respect to plasma-derived α2ap, these bands have been suggested to represent α2ap-fibrinogen aα chain, α2ap-fibrinogen aα dimer, and α2ap-fibrinogen aα polymers <cit> . comparison of fusion proteins as competitors of α2ap-mediated in vitro clot protection α2ap attenuates the ability of tpa to lyse fibrin clots by inhibiting plasmin generated by tpa-mediated activation of plasminogen. this property can be demonstrated in vitro using α2ap-deficient plasma. as shown in figure 5a, clots formed in the absence of tpa and α2ap were stable for > <dig> hours, whereas the addition of tpa lead to complete lysis within <dig> minutes. restoration of α2ap to its physiological concentration of <dig> μm restored approximately 70% of the area under the turbidity curve. the ability of the hsa-related fusion proteins to compete for the α2ap-mediated lysis attenuation was tested by addition of <dig> μm fusion proteins. although at this excess, some changes in the shape of the turbidity plot in the presence of fusion protein and the absence of fusion protein could be noted , the area under the curve of the turbidity curve did not differ from baseline, as exemplified for xl5-hsa and xl6-hsa in figure 5b. xl5-hsa significantly reduced the α2ap-mediated attenuation of clot lysis, shifting the auc from <dig> ± 14% of maximal clotting to <dig> ± <dig> % ; in contrast xl6-hsa did not compete for the α2ap effect. extension of these comparisons to the complete set of recombinant fusion proteins showed that only xl5-hsa and h6α2ap-hsa, under the conditions employed, reduced the α2ap effect, and that only the xl5-hsa reduction was statistically significant. fusion protein xl5-hsa is retained in experimental thrombi in mice and rabbits having obtained several lines of evidence that fusion protein xl5-hsa was the most effective fxiiia substrate of the recombinant proteins tested, we next asked whether, like α2ap, it was capable of being retained within whole blood clots in vivo. as shown in figure 6a, when equal doses of radiolabeled α2ap, xl5-hsa, and hsah <dig> were injected into mice that formed experimental thrombi in the vena cava due to ferric chloride administration, both α2ap and xl5-hsa were retained within clots to a significantly greater extent than hsah <dig> the retention of α2ap on a clot weight basis, was also significantly greater than that of xl5-hsa. similar results were obtained using a larger, rabbit experimental model in which the radiolabeled proteins were introduced, with a coagulation activator, into a whole blood segment within the isolated rabbit jugular vein. as shown in figure 6b, the three proteins were found to become incorporated into the clot with the same relative efficacy as in the murine model; both α2ap and xl5-hsa were incorporated to a greater extent than hsah <dig> however, in common with the murine results, the xl5-hsa tracer incorporation was significantly less than that of α2ap. fusion protein xl5-hsa is retained in a urea-sensitive manner in experimental thrombi in rabbits in the larger animal model, the rabbit, the greater physical size of the clot permitted its manipulation, unlike with the much smaller murine thrombi. prolonged stasis and the direct introduction of tissue factor activator into the isolated vessel strongly favoured thrombus formation in the rabbit model, as compared to the localized application of indirectly procoagulant ferric chloride to a localized area of a much smaller vessel in the mouse. accordingly, clot weights from rabbits ranged from <dig> to <dig> mg versus <dig> to <dig> mg in mice. this greater size permitted clot extraction in <dig> m urea and determination of the fraction of clot-bound radioactivity that was insensitive to urea, a hallmark of cross-linked protein clot incorporation. in these experiments, the three 125i-labeled proteins were each separately co-administered with 131i-labeled fibrinogen. as shown in figure 7a, approximately 50% of injected fibrinogen was clot-associated in a urea-insensitive manner; there were no differences between treatment groups, as expected because tracer-level doses of the recombinant proteins were employed. while significantly greater amounts of α2ap remained clot-bound after urea extraction than xl5-hsa , this represented 15- and <dig> -fold greater urea-insensitive retention than for hsah <dig> . discussion in this study, we sought to increase the stability and activity of hsa fusion proteins containing short n-terminal extensions that are substrates for transglutamination by fxiiia. our long-term goal was to produce well-tolerated therapeutic proteins for injection, with the long circulatory half-life of albumin, and the ability to compete the cross-linking of α2ap to fibrin in thrombi. replacing active α2ap in the clot with a protein incapable of inhibiting plasmin could render pathological clots easier to dissolve. others have suggested that chemically or mutationally inactivated α2ap could serve this purpose <cit> , while we have focused on the albumin fusion strategy <cit> , due to the ease of large-scale production of recombinant albumin <cit> . in this study, we built chimeric albumin fusion proteins modelled on α2ap-hsa, seeking to eliminate the partial proteolysis of this prototype, but retain and enhance its ability to be cross-linked by fxiiia. our approaches included shortening the natural α2ap-derived cross-linking site, replacing it with either of two fxiiia highly active substrate sequences identified by phage display, and capping all three novel chimerae with hexahistidine tags. substituting the sequence dqmmlpwpavtl for α2ap, in fusion protein xl5-hsa, was found to be the most effective approach. this sequence had been reported to be a highly favourable substrate for fxiiia-mediated transglutamination, when expressed fused to a phage coat protein or to glutathione sulfotransferase . when expressed fused to hsa, it yielded the candidate protein most rapidly and efficiently cross-linked to bpa, and the most effective competitor of α2ap crosslinking, both with small substrates and in competition of α2ap's in vitro antifibrinolytic effect. the molecular context of the fusion partner was relevant, since sequence wqhkidlpynga, identical to sequence f <dig> in <cit> , except for substitution of protease-susceptible r for p at position <dig> appeared to be much less active in fusion protein xl6-hsa than in the gst context. similarly, α2apk24a, although shown to be effectively crosslinked by fxiiia as α2ap or α2ap free peptides <cit> , was ineffective at competing α2ap crosslinking to fibrin in fusion protein xl4-hsa. although our avoidance of lys or arg residues in the fusion motifs was successful in avoiding degradation in each case, only xl5-hsa was clearly superior not only to xl4-hsa or xl6-hsa but also to α2ap-hsa. although the requirements for optimal substrates of fxiiia have not been precisely defined, they are thought to involve positioning of a reactive glutamine residue within a highly flexible sequence <cit> . fusion proteins xl4-, xl5-, and xl6-hsa all contained a reactive glutamine at position <dig> analogous to q <dig> the most reactive glutamine in the native α2ap sequence. q <dig> is more effectively cross-linked by fxiiia in the major form of α2ap that circulates in plasma, asn-α2ap, than in the minor precursor form, met-α2ap, which retains residues 1- <dig> <cit> . our finding that positioning a hexahistidine tag n-terminal to the fxiiia substrate motif reduced its activity in fusion proteins xl1- and xl2-hsa was consistent both with this natural example and with the general concept of flexibility of the reactive glutamine. previously, we found that α2ap-hsa was no more likely to be present in vivo in the rabbit jugular vein model of thrombosis than recombinant hsa <cit> . in contrast, xl5-hsa was retained in thrombi in vivo to a significantly greater extent than recombinant hsa in both rabbit and murine models. its degree of retention was less than that of human α2ap in both cases, suggesting that there is still room for improvement in defining an optimal sequence to render hsa efficiently cross-linked by factor xiiia. nevertheless, this is the first demonstration of targeting of an inactive carrier protein to in vivo clots by an attached transamidation substrate motif, although, as described below, others have shown in vivo clot association of transamidation substrate motif peptides <cit> and peptide-contrast agent conjugates <cit> the insolubility of cross-linked fibrin in <dig> m urea is a property that has been known for many years, and indeed is used clinically to diagnose fxiii deficiency <cit> . using this property, we showed that in vivo clot-associated xl5-hsa is urea-insoluble, like the majority of bound fibrin or α2ap, but unlike the majority of bound hsa. although much indirect or in vitro evidence supports the importance of α2ap cross-linking to fibrin with respect to clot resistance to fibrinolysis <cit> , this is to our knowledge the first demonstration of cross-linking of either α2ap protein or an engineered polypeptide into in vivo thrombi. other groups have used peptides in this regard, but predominantly in an analytical or imaging mode distinct from long-term goal of reducing thrombus size using cross-linkable proteins. robinson et al. showed that biotinylated α2ap peptide became cross-linked to human thrombi embolized into the lungs of ferrets and mice when infused in vivo <cit> . jaffer et al. employed an α2ap peptide linked to a near infrared fluorochrome to image murine thrombi formed following ferric chloride treatment of the femoral vessels <cit> , while miserus et al., used a similar α2ap peptide conjugated to a gadolinium-containing contrast agent to visualize murine carotid artery ferric chloride-induced thrombi <cit> . while these peptides and peptide-chemical conjugates show great promise for future improved detection of thrombi and stratification of patients, peptides are typically cleared from the circulation with extremely rapid pharmacokinetics. that fusion protein xl5-hsa was found to localize in in vivo thrombi to a greater extent than unmodified recombinant hsa suggests not only its superiority over our previously described α2ap -hsa chimera, but also its potential utility in being incorporated as a \"trojan horse\" into thrombi, and making them more susceptible to natural or pharmacological thrombolysis. CONCLUSIONS recombinant hsa with a dqmmlpwpavtlg4y n-terminal extension was more active as a substrate for fxiiia-mediated cross-linking to either artificial or natural transglutamination partners than other candidate motifs of identical or longer length, with or without an n-terminal his tag. xl5-hsa, unlike α2ap-hsa or h6α2ap-hsa, was not subject to detectable proteolysis by p. pastoris. of the proteins tested, xl5-hsa was the most effective competitor of α2ap-mediated resistance of fibrin clots to lysis. in contrast to previous results with α2ap-hsa, radiolabeled tracer xl5-hsa was found to a greater extent in experimentally-induced intravascular clots in both murine and rabbit in vivo venous thrombosis models; importantly, the majority of clot-associated xl5-hsa and plasma-derived α2ap, but not recombinant hsa, was shown to be insoluble to <dig> m urea, suggesting covalent cross-linking. our results suggest that fusion protein xl5-hsa has been sufficiently optimized over prototype α2ap-hsa to warrant in vivo testing as a potential protein drug rendering thrombi more susceptible to natural or pharmacological clot lysis. authors' contributions wps conceived of the study, secured competitive funding, directed experiments, and wrote the manuscript. lje-s performed all in vitro and in vivo experiments and developed and refined experimental protocols. both authors participated in editing and revising the manuscript. both authors read and approved the final manuscript.",

    "prompt": "What is the core message in the clinical note below? ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND pseudorabies virus , an alpha-herpesvirus, and the causative agent of aujeszky's diseases of swine <cit> , is a commonly used model organism for studies in pathogenesis and the molecular biology of herpesviruses. furthermore, it is widely utilized as a neural circuit tracer and has been reported to be suitable as a vector for gene delivery to various cells <cit> and as an oncolytic agent <cit> . the gene expressions of herpesviruses are currently undergoing intensive investigation in consequence of the development of new technologies allowing simultaneous analysis of the expressions of multiple genes. dna microarray approaches have been applied for the overall analysis of herpesvirus gene expression in several studies . microchip techniques are powerful tools that permit simultaneous measurement of the relative changes in quantity of thousands of genes of an organism, and the comparison of gene expression profiles under various circumstances. quantitative real-time rt-pcr is a much more sensitive and accurate method, but, at least at present, it is not well suited for the analysis of large numbers of samples. the herpesvirus genome however is, within the range that can be successfully analysed with this technique <cit> . the program of herpesvirus gene expression is controlled at multiple levels by complex interactions between viral and cellular factors. the lytic gene expressions of herpesviruses are strictly coordinated in a sequential cascade manner and are traditionally subdivided into immediate-early , early and late phases. ie proteins are involved in the control of the synthesis of e and l genes. the ie <dig> gene is the only ie gene of prv, and the most important regulator of viral gene expression. the e genes of herpesviruses are involved in various aspects of dna synthesis, while most l genes mainly encode the structural elements of the virus. the antisense transcripts llt and lat overlapping the icp <dig> and icp <dig> , respectively, are reported to play important roles in the establishment of latency in hsv <cit> . it has not yet been unequivocally clarified whether the expression of antisense transcript produced by the complementary dna strand of the ie <dig> gene is controlled solely by the lap producing llt or also by a putative promoter localized on the inverted repeat of the prv genome, producing a shorter transcript. in this study, we use the term 'antisense transcript' for the rna molecule transcribed from the complementary dna strand of the ie <dig> gene. it is well known that both the host response and the success of a pathogen are dependent on the quantity of particles infecting an organism; and, specifically in herpesviruses, the infecting dose determines whether the virus enters a latent state or induces an acute infection <cit> . a further important question is whether the global gene expression profile of the virus genome is dependent on the number of virus particles entering the cells. in both traditional and microarray studies, herpesvirus gene expression has been analysed by using a relatively high multiplicity of infection, typically moi~ <dig> plaque-forming unit /cell <cit> . theoretically, it is possible that herpesviruses express their genomes in a different manner when only a single virus particle infects a cell as compared with the situation when multiple virions enter a cell. in the present study, we addressed this issue by using low and high mois for the infection of cultured porcine kidney epithelial cells with wild-type prv, and subsequently analysed and compared the expressions of <dig> prv genes and two antisense transcripts using the sybr green-based real-time rt-pcr technique. RESULTS experimental design in this study, pk- <dig> cells were infected with pseudorabies virus at mois of <dig> and <dig> albeit the difference in the infectious dose in the two parallel experiments was 100-fold, an individual cell was invaded by only <dig> times more virus particles in the high-moi than in the low-moi experiment , the reason for this being that in the latter case approximately 90% of the cells remained uninfected. cells were harvested at <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> h post-infection , as in our earlier report <cit> . we used <dig> h as the maximum infection period in order to exclude the possibility of the initiation of new infection cycles in the low-moi experiment. in this study, we analysed the expression of <dig> genes and two antisense transcripts . for the calculation of relative expression ratios , we used the average <dig> h ect values of the high-moi experiments of both the \"samples\" and the \"references\" as controls, as in our earlier publication <cit> . we used a correction factor of <dig> for the calculation of r for the low-moi experiment . with this calculation technique, approximately the same numbers of infected cells, and hence the relative amounts of transcripts in an average infected cell, were compared in the two experiments. however, in the high-moi experiment, the proportion of the genome copy number in an infected cell was also 10-fold higher on average, at least before the start of viral dna replication , the reason for this being that in the high-moi experiment <dig> virus particles infected an average cell, while in the low-moi infection <dig> per cent of the cells were infected with a single virus particle. thus, to compare the gene expressions from a single virus dna per cell, two normalizations are necessary: multiplication of the r values of the low-moi data by <dig> and division of the r values of the high-moi data by <dig> in some calculations, the original data were handled accordingly . the relationship between the infectious dose and the genome copy number of prv becomes non-linear in later stages of viral infection; the dna copy numbers in the two experimental situations are therefore not comparable on the basis of the infectious dose. the r values of lat and ast were calculated by using the <dig> h ect values of the corresponding genes, ep <dig> and ie <dig> respectively, as the reference gene. rΔ values were used to monitor the net change in the quantity of viral transcripts within a given period of time . ra shows the ratio of the changes in the amounts of transcripts between two adjacent time points . we considered two principles for the selection of genes for expression analyses. we analysed the upstream genes of each nested gene cluster, the reason for this being that these genes are not overlapped by other genes, and the amounts of these transcripts are therefore proportional to their protein products. this is in contrast with the downstream genes, which, if transcribed from the promoter of an upstream gene, are not translated, because they do not have cap sequences that are required for the recognition by the ribosomes. furthermore, we analysed genes that are of primary importance in the regulation of global viral gene expression, such as ie <dig> ep <dig> vhs and ul <dig> gene expressions in the early stage of prv infection in the first <dig> h of infection, the viral dna replication has not yet been initiated, and the copy number of viral genomes in a cell therefore corresponds with the infectious dose. in this analysis, we found that the mrna levels of most examined prv genes were higher in the cells infected with the high moi than in those infected with the low moi at both <dig> h and <dig> h pi. this was not unexpected since in the former case viral dnas were represented in an approximately 10-fold higher proportion in an average infected cell. exceptions to this were the transcripts ul <dig> ul <dig> and ul <dig> mrnas at <dig> h pi, and ul <dig> ul <dig> ul <dig> and ul <dig> mrnas at <dig> h pi, and at both <dig> h and <dig> h: ie <dig> and ul <dig> mrnas, as well as, lat and ast. however, the expression levels normalized to the genome copy number showed an inverse pattern: only a few genes were expressed at higher abundance in the high-moi than in low-moi infection . ast was expressed at a considerably higher quantity in the cells infected with the low moi than in those infected with the high moi . the expression rate of a single genomic region encoding the ast was even <dig> times higher in the low-dose infection experiment . in the high-dose infection <dig> of the <dig> genes exhibited higher expression levels at <dig> h than at <dig> h pi. it should be noted that <dig> of them are regulatory genes. the fourth regulatory prv gene, ep <dig> is expressed at a very high level during the first <dig> h in the high-moi infection . apart from ep <dig> ul <dig> was the only gene that was expressed at a higher extent in the early stages of infection than at <dig> h pi in the high-moi experiment. the ie <dig> gene is the only one that was expressed in a higher amount at <dig> h than at <dig> h pi under both experimental conditions . overall, it appears that the <dig> regulatory genes were expressed at relatively high levels before the onset of dna replication in the high-moi infection, which was not the case in low-moi infection, with the exception of the ie <dig> gene. we think that the reason for the higher expression of regulatory genes at the onset of viral dna replication in the high-moi infection is that more regulatory proteins are needed to carry out the multiplication of a higher copy number of the viral genome. the rate of change in gene expression within the <dig> h to <dig> h interval was higher in more than two-thirds of the prv genes in the low-moi than in the high-moi infection . the proportion of ast to ie <dig> mrna molecules was <dig> at <dig> h pi, and <dig> at <dig> h pi in cells infected with the low moi, while this ratio was extremely low at both <dig> h and <dig> h pi in the high-moi infection . thus, the proportion of ast to ie <dig> mrna was 39-fold higher at <dig> h pi and 293-fold higher at <dig> h pi in the low-moi than in the high-moi infection. in the early stages of prv infection, the amount of ast was very high; it even significantly exceeded the level of ie <dig> mrnas at <dig> h pi in the low-moi infection, while the amount of ast and also its ratio to ie <dig> mrna were extremely low in the high-moi infection. moreover, ie <dig> mrna is expressed to a significantly higher extent in the low-moi experiment despite the <dig> times lower copy number of prv dna in an infected cell, which is especially important because ie <dig> is a dna-binding protein. we think that this observation reveals an important regulatory mechanism of the herpesviruses, which is as follows: in a high-titre infection, the virus initiates a lytic infection in a cell, while in a low-titre infection, the virus has the choice of whether to establish a dormant state or enter a lytic cycle in a cell. the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon might be based on the interaction of ie <dig> and ast genes at both the transcription and translation levels. the ie <dig> protein might exert a negative effect on the synthesis of ast, such as in lat in hsv <cit> by binding the promoter of the antisense transcript. furthermore, the complementary transcripts might mutually influence each other's expression transcript by rna-rna interaction. in a low-moi infection, the two transcripts exhibit a complementary expression pattern, which indicates a competition between the two transcripts. in a high-moi infection, however, the high initial amount of ie <dig> gene product inhibits the expression of ast. the significance of this infection strategy could be that, in the case of a low-amount infection, the virus has no chance to invade the host cells; therefore, it is better to hide against the immune surveillance. the ep <dig> gene is expressed in higher quantity at both <dig> h pi and <dig> h pi in the high-moi infection than in low-moi infection, which is in contrast with lat, its antisense partner, whose expression level was lower in the high-moi infection . thus, the ratios of lat to ep <dig> mrna molecules were <dig> -fold higher at <dig> h pi and <dig> -fold higher at <dig> h pi in the low-moi than in the high-moi experiment, although, unlike ast, lat is abundantly expressed in the high-moi infection. accordingly, similarly to ast, lat is expressed in a significantly higher proportion to ep <dig> mrna in the low-moi infection in the early stages of infection, which may also be important as concerns of the replication strategy of the virus. our analyses additionally showed that ast and lat are, at least partly, expressed independently from each other, which supports the existence of separate elements controlling the expressions of the two antisense transcripts. indeed, ast was suggested to be controlled by an antisense promoter localized in the outer regions of inverted repeats <cit> . gene expressions in later stages of prv infection at <dig> h pi the transcript levels of more than three-quarters of the prv genes were still higher in the cells infected with the high moi than in those infected with the low moi . however, in about two-third of the viral genes the rate of change in the expression level was higher in the low-moi than in the high-moi infection . in the low-moi infection, the amounts of <dig> transcripts were less than 10% of those in the high-moi infection at <dig> h pi. all of the examined us genes are expressed at a significantly lower level in the low-than in the high-titre infection at <dig> h pi. there were significant decreases in the quantities of both ast and lat in the low-titre infection at <dig> h pi relative to the <dig> h values . we explain this phenomenon by the negative effect of the regulatory genes on their antisense partners. regulatory genes are upregulated at the onset of dna replication , which exerts an inhibitory effect on the expression of ast and lat. in contrast, there were increases in the amounts of antisense transcripts in the high-moi in this time interval. however, while lat was expressed at high level under the high-moi conditions, the ast expression remained extremely low in this period of infection. the amount of the ie <dig> transcript was practically unchanged within the <dig> h to <dig> h infection period under either infection conditions. there was a <dig> -fold increase in the ep <dig> mrna level within the <dig> h to <dig> h infection period in the low-moi infection, as compared with only <dig> in the high-moi experiment. on average, the amounts of mrnas in low titre infection became higher than those in the high-infection titre by <dig> h pi in more than half of the prv genes . we assume that the reason for this might be that the ie <dig> gene, the major coordinator of gene expression, is expressed at higher levels at <dig> and <dig> h pi at low-moi than at high-moi infection. moreover, in the high-moi infection the amount of ast reached almost 30% of the transcript level in the low-moi infection, while lat was expressed at approximately the same level under the two infection conditions at <dig> h pi. the genes expressed at lower levels in the low-dose infection appeared to be clustered on adjacent genomic locations . each gene and the two antisense transcripts were expressed at higher rates within the <dig> h to <dig> h period in the low-moi than in the high-moi infection without exception . in the high-moi infection, <dig> genes and lat peaked at <dig> h within the 6-h examination period, while in the low-moi infection only the us <dig> transcript had a slightly lower r value at <dig> h than at <dig> h pi. the us <dig> gene was the only one among the <dig> prv genes which was expressed at a higher level at <dig> h than at <dig> h pi in another study <cit> . intriguingly, the ep <dig> mrnas reached a <dig> -fold higher level in the low-dose than in the high-dose infection in an average cell at <dig> h pi. furthermore, at <dig> h pi the ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes were expressed at an approximately <dig> times higher level under the low-moi than under the high-moi conditions. gene expression kinetics within the <dig> to 6-h infection period the expression of most prv genes basically differed under the two infection conditions , which is in contrast with the case of rhesus monkey rhadinovirus , whose lytic gene expression commences at a fixed pace in infected cells, regardless of the moi <cit> . most genes were expressed at a lower level in a cell in the low-moi experiment in the first <dig> h of infection, but more than half of these gene products surpassed the high-moi values by <dig> h pi. the r values of <dig> prv genes were higher in the low-moi than in the high-moi infection at every examined time point, while the opposite was true in <dig> genes: ul <dig> ul <dig> ul <dig> ul <dig> ul <dig> ul <dig> ul <dig> ul <dig> , ul <dig> us <dig> us <dig> us <dig> and us <dig> . these latter genes form clusters on the basis of their localization on the genome , which suggests that the adjacent genomic sequences might be under common regulatory control. this observation is supported by the similarity of the ra curves of adjacent genes . for example, the expression rates of the ul <dig> ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes were similar to each other in both experiments, but each of them exhibited an inverse expression pattern in the two infection conditions. all genes were expressed at a higher rate within the <dig> h to <dig> h period of infection in the low-titre experiment, except for ie <dig> and the two antisense transcripts. the quantities of ie <dig> mrnas were similar in the two experiments, except at <dig> h pi, where the level of the transcripts was <dig> -fold higher in the low-moi infection. thus, the amount of total ie <dig> transcript in an infected cell appears to be under strict control, independently of the initial infection conditions. in contrast, the expression of the ep <dig> gene differed basically in the two experiments. in the high-moi experiment, the amount of ep <dig> mrnas was high from the first hour of infection, and its expression even declined by <dig> h in the high-moi infection, while the amount of these transcripts rapidly increased throughout the 6-h infection period in the low-dose infection, and reached a <dig> -fold higher level compared to that of the high-dose infection by <dig> h. the ratio of sense and antisense transcripts during the 6-h infection period displayed intriguing patterns. first of all, in the high-moi infection the amount of ast and its ratio to ie <dig> mrna were very low throughout the 6-h infection period. we demonstrated an inverse relationship in the expression kinetics of ie <dig> mrna and ast and also ep <dig> mrna and lat in the low-moi infection; however, we did not observe this inverse relationship between the complementary transcripts under the high-moi conditions . in an earlier report <cit> , we showed that treatment of infected cells with cycloheximide resulted in significant increases in the amounts of both ie <dig> mrna and ast, while phosphonoacetic acid treatment led to a decrease in ie <dig> mrna and a significant increase in the ast level. these results suggest a negative effect of the ie <dig> transactivator on asp synthesis. we explain the huge drop in asp level in the infected cells in the early stage of the high-moi infection by the presence of a 10-fold higher amount of inhibitory ie <dig> protein localized in the tegument of the infecting virions <cit> . the same reason could account for the lower ie <dig> mrna level in the high-moi infection. the us <dig> gene was expressed in the late kinetics in our earlier low-moi analysis in both phophonoacetic acid-treated and non-treated samples. these results are in concordance with those of the present high-dose infection experiment, i.e. us <dig> mrna was expressed at a relatively low level at <dig> h, which even dropped by <dig> h pi. the highest rate of us <dig> mrna expression was observed at <dig> h, with a rate typical of l genes. the pearson correlation coefficients of the r, rΔ, and ra values precisely show the degree of similarity of the expression kinetics of the genes in the low- and high-moi experiments . several genes exhibited high correlations for all three parameters. for example, the ie <dig> ul <dig> ul <dig> ul <dig> ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes gave high correlation coefficients for the r, rΔ and ra values. the us <dig> gene behaved in an irregular manner; it gave a relatively high correlation for the r values, no correlation of rΔ, and an inverse correlation for the ra values. ast yielded relatively high negative values for all three parameters, indicating a significant negative correlation. the expressions of lat under the two experimental conditions did not correlate on the basis of the r values, whereas it gave a very high negative correlation for its rΔ and ra values. the effect of the moi on the overall gene expression of hsv- <dig> has been investigated by wagner and colleagues <cit> , who found that, following the infection of cultured cells by wild-type virus at mois ranging from <dig> to <dig> pfu/cell, the temporal profiles of transcript abundance were essentially the same. this is in sharp contrast with our results. we explain the differences by the low resolution of the microarray technique that wagner et al. used for their analysis. an analysis of the global transcription of rhesus monkey rhadinovirus, a γ-herpesvirus, has revealed differential gene expression at different mois <cit> , but these data cannot be compared because they related to later time points than in our analysis. CONCLUSIONS our analysis has revealed that almost all of the examined prv genes exhibited different expression dynamics under the two experimental conditions. most prv genes were expressed at a lower level in the low-moi than in the high-moi experiment in the early stages of infection; however, the reverse was true when the transcript levels were normalized to the genome copy numbers. in the low-moi infection, slightly more than half of the prv transcripts outran the high-moi values by <dig> h pi. the lower ie <dig> transcript per genome in the high-titre infection experiment might account for the lower level of global prv gene expression per genome in the high-moi infection. however, the expression of viral genes per dna did not uniformly decrease; some genes even became more active in the high-moi infection, which indicates the selective effect of the reduced availability of the ie <dig> protein. the most dramatic difference between the two moi infections was observed in ast, which was expressed at a more than two log higher level in an infected cell in the low-moi infection, which is a <dig> log higher activity of a single dna region encoding the asp. the ratio of lat/ep <dig> was also significantly lower in the high-than in the low-moi infection. the reasons for and the mechanisms of these phenomena remain to be clarified. furthermore, genes localized in adjacent regions on the viral genome exhibited similar expression properties, indicating the existence of synchronizing mechanisms of gene expression.",

    "prompt": "Summarize this clinical report for a busy practitioner. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND the genome encodes the physiological functions and regulatory logic by which a cell interacts with its environment. therefore, visualization and exploration of genome-wide data in the context of their organization across the genome is critical to fully understand how an organism dynamically utilizes the information encoded in its genome to affect its physiology <cit> . recent advances in whole genome tiling arrays and next-generation sequencing technologies are providing new ways to collect genome-wide data at much higher resolution than previously possible. the ability to dynamically explore and visualize these data in a flexible, interactive and informative manner will be key to understanding these data and directly linking the mechanistic information they provide with cellular physiology. to this end, we have created the gaggle genome browser , an interactive graphical tool which enables plotting of multiple tracks of data of diverse types along the genome at multiple scales with dynamic panning and zooming. applications initially targeted are visualization of expression and protein-dna interaction from several measurement technologies including gene expression arrays, whole-genome tiling arrays, mass spectrometry, chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing for microbial genomes. several genome browsers have existed for some time and our intention was not to duplicate previous efforts. with development of ggb, we focus on interactive exploration, easy access to user data, and interoperability, along with the ability to handle large sets of user-generated data gracefully. interoperability with the gaggle <cit> framework is a central feature. by connecting to the gaggle framework, the genome browser joins a suite of bioinformatics tools giving the researcher the power to analyze complex biological systems across several data types, from high-resolution gene expression to protein interactions, metabolic pathways, and much more. implementation the gaggle genome browser is written in the java <cit> programming language using the swing ui framework and the sqlite <cit> database engine. message passing between applications is provided by the gaggle framework. these components support the design goals of creating a cross-platform interactive graphical application that can handle large user-generated datasets, interoperate with existing tools and flexibly accommodate extension. several key features are illustrated in figure <dig> data model the program shares its basic data model with several genomics software packages. its core abstractions are sequences, tracks and features, with a dataset composed of a collection of sequences and a collection of tracks. sequences, which may be chromosomes, plasmids, contigs or any other sequences of interest, define the coordinate system on which track data is plotted. tracks group together features from a common source. a feature is a tuple containing coordinates on the genome augmented by additional data specific to a particular type of feature. genes, microarray probe values, peptide measurements, or protein-dna binding sites are all potentially features. in addition, datasets, sequences and tracks have attributes which are used to assign visual properties, provenance or other information to these entities. this flexible and extensible data model means that our software is not tied to any particular format, data type, or array platform. any feature encoding data that can be related to position on the genome can be displayed in the browser. rendering features are drawn on the plot by an implementation of trackrenderer, an abstract class which is a key extension point of the program . visualizations are implemented by extending this class. several renderers are built into the program including those for genes, quantitative data series, and heatmaps. renderers visually encode properties of individual features using color, shape, and other cues. tracks are mapped to the user's choice of renderer by the track's attributes, which also hold other parameters used to configure the renderer. the open-ended data model for features with arbitrary key/value pairs dovetails with customizable renderers to support extension of the software with new visual representations or visualize unforeseen data types while confining code changes to a limited scope. data access an in-process database, sqlite, provides data storage and a command shell with a standard data manipulation language without the need for a separate database server or the overhead of socket communication. features are stored in a database in a separate table per track to avoid restricting the types of features the program can handle. all feature tables have columns holding coordinates on the genome. additional columns may be included to represent properties such as quantitative values or statistical measures. the main task of the program is to visualize features according to their position on the genome. doing this quickly requires an efficient flow of data from the data store to the screen, with particular attention to minimizing disk access. features are collected in tracks, which may have hundreds of thousands of features for tiling arrays or many millions for high-throughput sequencing. for large tracks, features should only be loaded into memory as needed. this is accomplished by dividing each track into contiguous blocks of features. a block may be loaded into memory and paged out as needed, providing a unit for caching and preserving a degree of locality . like individual features, blocks are keyed by their genomic coordinates, so the program can efficiently determine which blocks intersect the visible window and schedule them to be loaded. caching reduces the odds of rereading the same block repeatedly while keeping a tunable limit on memory usage. queueing both data access and rendering take place off the swing event dispatch thread so the user interface remains responsive to user input. data access and rendering are time-consuming and can lag behind the events generated by the ui. this mismatch of rates is handled using the queueing arrangement shown in figure <dig> to protect swing's event dispatch thread from long-running tasks, ggb creates a separate task queue for data access and rendering tasks. a worker thread takes tasks from this second queue, rendering to an off screen image buffer. only the copy to the display need be performed by the swing event dispatch thread. gaggle connectivity the genome browser is a stand-alone desktop program, but its power is multiplied when used within the gaggle framework. the gaggle framework <cit> provides data exchange between bioinformatics applications using a handful of universal data types which cover a wide range of use cases within the systems biology domain. gaggle data types include lists of identifiers, tuples , matrices containing numeric data, and networks. applications become part of the gaggle framework by implementing the ability to send and receive messages containing these data types. software tools connected through the gaggle include: cytoscape <cit> , a network viewer; mev <cit> , an application for analysis, visualization and data-mining of large-scale genomic data; the r project <cit> for statistical computing; and bioinformatics resource manager <cit> , a data management, analysis and integration environment for systems biology. firegoose <cit> , a toolbar for the firefox browser, further extends the gaggle environment to web resources such as: kegg <cit> , for metabolic pathways; string <cit> , for protein interactions; and david <cit> , for functional annotations. the effect of gaggle connectivity is that the genome browser can focus on visualization without taking on the impossible task of reimplementing all the functionality of the various gaggle-connected resources. architecture the application is factored into modular components which communicate with each other through events. the application exposes an api for use by components, plug-ins and scripting. this api is used to implement gaggle integration and forms the basis for an r package that enables control of the genome browser by commands within the r environment. heer et al. <cit> present a system of software design patterns for visualization, several of which are applied in ggb. the general structure of the application loosely follows the reference model design pattern, a specialization of the model-view-controller pattern that further divides the model into the underlying data model and a visualization, a mapping onto visual properties such as color, shape, and position. when a single track has features numbering in the tens or hundreds of millions, allocating an object for each feature is prohibitively inefficient. for this reason, features in ggb are typically flyweights <cit> . for all features of a track, a single flyweight feature provides an object oriented interface backed by parallel arrays. an individual feature then reduces to an index into the arrays and iterating through features simply amounts to incrementing the index. thus memory is used efficiently and features nearby in the genome are also nearby in memory boosting cache locality. software designed to meet the fluid requirements of research applications must be flexible, adapting to changing needs and a range of usage styles <cit> . the goal of our architecture is to provide the necessary flexibility through extensibility and interoperability with a range of tools from point-and-click web resources to sophisticated environments such as r. RESULTS the architecture described above results in a versatile tool for visualizing genome related data. data can be imported from a wide variety of sources including the gff standard file format <cit> and the ucsc genome browser <cit> through a wizard interface. once imported, data can be visualized at multiple zoom levels and navigated by scrolling, searching, or jumping to directly to bookmarked regions of interest. computationally oriented users can leverage the powerful data manipulation features of the r statistical environment <cit> or sql. track data can be visualized using several renderers, including one for heatmaps and a scaling renderer that changes representation based on zoom level . fast graphical rendering is difficult to achieve in cross-platform applications. ggb delivers frame rates sufficient for interactive visualization for datasets in our experience . leaving aside window dimensions, rendering speed depends mainly on the number of features visible in the viewing area and the complexity of their visual representation. for example, a heatmap takes longer to draw than a line plot. rendering speed shows no discernible dependence on the size of the database or total number of features. in all cases, even when rendering slows, the program remains responsive to user input, resulting in good subjective performance. the program has been tested with datasets as large as <dig> million features, equivalent to covering human chromosome <dig> at single nucleotide resolution. it runs comfortably with a heap size of <dig> mb resulting in a total memory footprint of about <dig> mb independent of total data size. we tested the program both on a workstation class machine and on modest hardware finding adequate performance even on the low-end machine. further performance measurements are available on the ggb website <cit> . a pair of case studies demonstrate the use of the gaggle genome browser in analyzing diverse, complex and large datasets to discover biologically meaningful insights. the first focuses on a discovery of internal promoters that was made possible by extensive manual exploration and curation of the transcriptome structure in conjunction with protein-dna interactions and interactive statistical analysis in r. the second example illustrates that ggb gracefully handles <dig> tracks of single nucleotide resolution next-generation sequencing data, with a total of over <dig> million features in a <dig> mb database. case study: discovery of a conditionally active promoter inside a coding sequence of the succinate dehydrogenase operon our genome browser was developed in conjunction with a study of the transcriptome structure of halobacterium salinarum <cit> . transcription and protein-dna binding were measured using whole-genome tiling arrays at several time points over the growth curve. this data was used to revise computationally predicted genes and discover new protein-coding regions and non-coding rnas. a segmentation algorithm was used to find breaks in transcription defining transcription start and termination sites and operon structure. in some cases, these structures were shown to change over the growth curve revealing the dynamic nature of transcription. chip-chip data was used to relate changes in transcription to the binding of transcription factors. an important discovery made in this study was that there is a higher than expected incidence of transcription initiation inside operons, including within the coding sequences of member genes. the discovery of these and other novel insights required the genome browser to support extensive interactive exploration of transcriptome structure changes and protein-dna interactions in context of the genome map and to integrate well with r, which was used to process raw signal data and compute derived data such as segmentation and probable binding sites. part of this analysis is reconstructed here to illustrate the features of the genome browser and its interoperability with other tools. the reader is encouraged to follow along with the detailed instructions on the gaggle website <cit> . in brief, we will focus on an observation that there is a growth-associated transcriptome structure change within the <dig> gene operon for succinate dehydrogenase. we wished to investigate whether the break in transcription associated with this event coincides with the location of a transcription factor binding site for the transcription factor tfbd. we assayed dna binding for tfbd using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by two different whole genome tiling array platforms, an in-house array with <dig> base-pair resolution <cit> and a higher resolution nimblegen tiling array . part of the intent was to test the sufficiency of the <dig> bp array to predict binding sites. given the low resolution of this data it is difficult to evaluate visually whether there is a statistically significant tfbd binding event in the vicinity of the putative internal promoter. the resolution to which specific binding sites in a chip-chip assay can be identified is limited by: the resolution of the tiling microarray, and the variable sizes of the immunoprecipitated dna fragments. together, these issues can influence the accuracy of localizing tfbss from chip-chip data. to address these technical challenges we developed medichi <cit> , to precisely localize binding locations at a resolution higher than the tiling array probe spacing. medichi produces a model fit and peaks representing locations and intensities of predicted tfbss. the workflow used to derive these results started with a track of chip-chip data in ggb, which was transmitted to r for analysis with medichi. products of that analysis are then transmitted back to the genome browser for visualization. data transfer was done by establishing a connection between the genome browser and r using the gaggle framework assisted by a library of supporting functions called genome_browser_support.r. first, a description of the dataset was broadcasted from the genome browser to r. this descriptive data about the dataset and its tracks includes information necessary to access the genome browser's underlying database directly from within r. sharing the database between r and ggb amounts to a form of pass-by-reference which avoids pushing large data structures through gaggle's messaging protocol, efficiently passing pointers instead. the <dig> bp resolution chip-chip track was selected by interrogating the dataset metadata and the track data loaded into the r environment . medichi was then applied to the chip-chip data over the genome region containing the succinate dehydrogenase operon. the genome browser's search function was used to find the coordinates of this region for input into medichi's chip.deconv function . the two kinds of derived data from this analysis -- a profile which represents the best fit of medichi's model to the data and a list of peaks at the predicted sites of protein-dna binding -- were broadcasted back to the genome browser for visualization . the genome browser's track visual properties editor was then used to set rendering options for the new tracks . by visualizing the raw and processed transcriptome and chip-chip data we observed a binding site for tfbd close to the 3' end of sdhb. as growth progresses, a break in the transcript for this operon appears, suggesting that there are condition-dependent alternative transcripts for this operon. based on such interactive analysis we hypothesized the presence of transcriptional promoters in at least 40% of all operons in h. salinarum nrc- <dig> several of these were validated with promoter-gfp fusion assays. in sum, the interactive exploration of the diverse genomic datasets within ggb was crucial in formulating hypotheses that led to the discovery of extraordinary complexity in prokaryotic transcription. case study: inspection of transcriptome structure through interactive exploration of <dig> mb of next-generation sequencing data passalacqua, et al. <cit> mapped the transcriptome of bacillus anthracis at single-nucleotide resolution using high-throughput sequencing technology . to test our ability to handle data at this density, we imported the eight tracks of single nucleotide coverage data for this <dig> megabase genome. as represented in the genome browser, these ~ <dig> million features occupy <dig> mb. ggb renders this data responsively and maintains a moderate memory footprint . this visualization is shown in figure <dig> and is available as a live demo on the gaggle website <cit> . bookmarks annotating a region of the genome with a name and short description are included to allow quick navigation to features discussed in the paper. because data come from instruments, public repositories and other software in a bewildering variety of formats, ggb allows users to import data using their choice of tools and scripting languages. in this example, a short python script created the sqlite data file taking as input sequence annotation data from ncbi and coverage data provided by the authors in tab-delimited text files. the same result could have been achieved using r and gaggle or sqlite's command line shell as well as importing from formatted text files. discussion related work the insight to be gained by visualizing biological data plotted along the scaffold of the genome has long been recognized. there are several established genome browsers. recent developments in both laboratory techniques and computing technologies have motivated several new entries in this category as well. the ucsc genome browser <cit> and its microbial counterpart <cit> are the most widely known. a major asset of these popular resources is that each model organism is augmented with a rich collection of curated track data. the table browser feature <cit> provides user-level and programmatic access to this data making these services excellent data sources as well as visualization tools. a wizard interface to acquire chromosome layout data from these sources is built into ggb, as is a link in the right-click menu that opens the currently selected or displayed region in the ucsc genome browser, for available organisms. the ucsc genome browsers are page-based web applications in which images are generated on the server, which places some limits on interactivity. for example, pan and zoom operations require a page refresh. rich web technologies can provide a more interactive experience with all the advantages of a remotely hosted web application. x:map <cit> is an impressive example, using the google maps api to interactively scroll and zoom through pre-rendered image tiles. jbrowse <cit> demonstrates the efficiency of ajax based client-side rendering. like its predecessor gbrowse <cit> , jbrowse is backed by the bioperl library. web applications benefit from handling data and cpu intensive operations on the server. however, requiring users to upload their own data to another institution's server has implications for security and bandwidth. even so, a rich web implementation remains an appealing option especially one taking advantage of the enhanced vector graphics capabilities of flash, svg or html <dig> our choice to build the ggb as a desktop application was largely motivated by the need to support large user-generated datasets. java was chosen to complement other gaggle tools and for cross-platform support. other desktop genome browsers also implemented in java include the apollo genome annotation curation tool <cit> , which was used to annotate the fly genome. affymetrix released the integrated genome browser <cit> and the supporting genoviz sdk <cit> as open-source projects. the broad institute provides argo <cit> and igv <cit> . the recently published mochiview <cit> is an excellent tool which integrates support for motif detection based on chip data. both igv and mochiview emphasize handling of high-density data types. the central distinguishing feature of ggb is gaggle integration, which offers a wealth of options for exploring different types of data in relation to location on the genome. also, ggb's flexibility in track rendering enables visualizations that would be difficult to reproduce using any other software. this flexibility derives mainly from a variety of customized renderers and a free-form approach to laying out tracks. multiple data series may be drawn on top of each other or partially overlapping, using transparency and z-order to convey additional information. finally, ggb offers a point-and-click wizard for creating a new project based on any genome curated by ucsc. a similar feature using ncbi as a data source is under development. future directions ggb remains a work in progress. various directions for future development are under consideration, dependent on user demand. primarily, ggb is designed to be ready for extension in the kinds of visualizations and the data types being visualized as well as additional avenues of interoperability. a feature currently lacking is the ability to work directly with sequence data. directly storing and looking up sequence data is one option, but we hope that integration, through gaggle or other mechanisms, with existing applications may serve this purpose. we also do not display exons, given the emphasis in our own research on microbes. new data types and renderers supporting exon display could be implemented through existing extension points. interoperability is a particular emphasis in our development efforts. building on gaggle integration, we are prototyping a library of r functions for communicating with ggb. further developing this library could help computational scientists use the sophisticated analysis and data manipulation capabilities of r and bioconductor <cit> together with visualization in the genome browser. for other users, enhanced point-and-click import of data from widely used sources such as the ucsc genome browser, ncbi entrez <cit> , or das <cit> would be most important. extending these mechanisms would allow the software to be applied to a larger variety of organisms and to more easily take advantage of the wealth of existing resources. to address rendering performance in zoomed out views, where data points greatly outnumber the pixels available in which to display them, our scaling renderer aggregates features during rendering by computing ranges and means. precomputing these aggregates at predefined scales could further increase performance. buffering and reusing previously rendered image tiles would decrease cpu load while increasing opportunities for parallelism. CONCLUSIONS ggb provides the researcher with an interactive visualization tool for any data type that can be related to a location on the genome. through the gaggle framework, ggb can function as part of a powerful suite of bioinformatics tools able to exchange data with analysis software, other visualizations, and several public data sources. biological data can be joined together along several axes. expression, interactions, and functions can be merged by gene or protein identifiers. sequence similarity can form the basis of mapping data across organisms by orthology. in the gaggle genome browser, heterogeneous data is joined by its location on the genome to create information-rich visualizations yielding insight into transcription and its regulation and, ultimately, a better understanding of the mechanisms that enable the cell to dynamically respond to its environment. availability and requirements the gaggle genome browser is written in java and depends on the sqlite database engine. it runs on linux, mac os x, and windows, either as a stand-alone application or by web-start. we recommend a minimum screen resolution of <dig> × <dig> and at least <dig> gb of memory. the program and its source code are released under the terms of the lgpl http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html and are available on the gaggle web site <cit> . demos, documentation and forms for submitting bug reports and feature requests are also linked from this page. authors' contributions jcb designed and implemented the software and drafted the manuscript. tk performed the characterization of the h. salinarum transcriptome that led to the case study. djr performed the analysis of the h. salinarum transcriptome that led to the case study and assisted in r and medichi integration. dt reviewed software design. nsb conceived and initiated the project, provided direction and feedback on the quality of results and software design and crafted the case study and drafted the manuscript. all authors reviewed and approved the manuscript and reviewed early versions of the software.",

    "prompt": "Provide a concise recap of the clinical trial results. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND all eukaryotes use the same fundamental machinery to drive cell cycle progression but multicellular organisms face the additional challenge of regulating the time and place of proliferation throughout development. a well conserved aspect of this developmental regulation is that cells normally arrest in g1-phase of the cell cycle prior to differentiation. this provides a quiescent stage for differentiation to begin and, once cells start to adopt their terminal fate, most will never re-enter a proliferative state. in tumorigenesis, however, re-entry of arrested cells into abnormal proliferation can occur <cit> . the drosophila eye provides an experimentally amenable example of developmentally regulated proliferation and has therefore been extensively studied as a model. differentiation of the individual facets of the compound eye occurs in a moving wave from the posterior to the anterior of the eye imaginal disc, implying that there is a gradient of increasing cell maturity from anterior to posterior in the disc. the front of the wave of development is marked by an indentation known as the morphogenetic furrow <cit> . several hours prior to the passage of the mf all cells in the eye disc arrest in g1-phase <cit> . after the mf passes, those cells that have not yet started to differentiate as photoreceptors re-enter s-phase for one terminal round of division, the \"second mitotic wave\" <cit> . here we focus on the mechanisms responsible for establishing and maintaining g1-arrest of cells prior to the mf . specifically, we aim to understand how cells become synchronous and arrest in g1-phase and to learn how the signals that drive the wave of eye development direct this process. this aspect of developmental control of proliferation in drosophila is not well understood, although it has been investigated in a number of different contexts including the eye, the wing and the embryo <cit> . most significantly in the eye, decapentaplegic signalling is required to maintain g <dig> arrest in the anterior region of the arrested zone. dpp appears to repress cyclin e, since the removal of several cyce inhibitors <cit> causes a similar phenotype to the lack to the dpp receptor, thick veins or to the overexpression of a cyce transgene <cit> . more recently, firth and baker have concluded that dpp and hedgehog act redundantly, and between them are sufficient to arrest cells in g <dig> <cit> . this involvement of dpp and hh is consistent with their roles as the primary secreted signals that drive mf progression. finally, the overexpression of cyclin a or the absence of the cyclin kinase inhibitor roughex can also induce s-phase entry in the npr <cit> . together, these earlier studies have identified a number of different mechanisms of control of g <dig> arrest but it is notable that no common checkpoint has been identified and no unified view of the process has yet been proposed. providing an explanation for this lack of a clear model, our results indicate that in the eye disc no single component is fully responsible for the developmental cell cycle arrest prior to the morphogenetic furrow. we show that first, hh and dpp together promote entry into mitosis of the cells prior to g <dig> arrest, thereby driving cells into g1-phase and initiating the npr. then, an overlapping set of cell cycle inhibitors combine to form an efficient and robust barrier to cell cycle progression. this barrier depends partially on the inhibition of cyclin e and de2f <dig> activity, also under the control of dpp and hh. however, in contrast to previous work <cit> , our results show that the role of hh and dpp in maintaining g <dig> arrest, is largely confined to the anterior part of the npr. the inhibition of cyclin a by rux becomes the major barrier to s-phase entry in the posterior region and, significantly, this is independent of both dpp and hh. this analysis of the relative importance of the different players involved in g <dig> arrest allows us to integrate them into an overall model of signal-regulated synchronisation and proliferative arrest. RESULTS defining the region of g <dig> arrest in the eye imaginal disc between the proliferating cells in the anterior of the eye imaginal disc and the smw is a broad band of cells that are arrested in g1-phase <cit> ; they span about 11– <dig> rows of cells. given the accepted view that the morphogenetic furrow moves forward, on average, by one row of ommatidia every <dig> min <cit> , we estimate that on average cells remain in this g <dig> arrest for five to six hours. interestingly, this is only slightly longer than the estimate of the normal g <dig> phase of cells in the proliferating region of the disc. this is based on the observation that the doubling time for cells in the eye disc is approximately <dig> hours <cit> , and that the proportion of cells in g <dig> phase in proliferating disc cells is one third <cit> . these estimates imply that the formation of this non-proliferative region depends significantly on cell cycle synchronization as they approach the mf, as well as on specific arrest mechanisms. in this paper we define the npr as corresponding to the absence of brdu incorporation anterior to the smw . so, from anterior to posterior in the eye disc are 1) the region where undifferentiated cells proliferate randomly; 2) the npr ; and 3) the second mitotic wave . note that in the anterior part of the npr, cells do not enter g <dig> arrest until after mitosis, so the last cells to be detected by brdu staining actually enter g <dig> one or two rows later, after completion of g <dig> and m-phases. the activity of de2f <dig> is largely absent from the npr, as measured by the expression of a pcna-gfp reporter <cit> , which contains the de2f <dig> binding sequence from the promoter of the pcna gene . we observed that the downregulation of brdu staining coincides precisely with the onset of atonal expression <cit> anterior to the furrow , and with the loss of homothorax expression . however, in clones of ato or hth mutant cells enter g <dig> arrest normally, implying that these genes are not essential for establishing the npr. to characterise the anatomy of the npr further, we have used 3-dimensional reconstruction software to image the disc . this clearly showed that the morphogenetic furrow forms the posterior region of the npr. it also allowed a clear view of the 'peripodial membrane', the layer of squamous cells that overlie the disc-proper and which can influence aspects of disc development <cit> . brdu positive cells are present in the peripodial membrane, but these were randomly distributed, indicating the absence of coordination of g <dig> arrest between the two adjacent epithelia. to prevent the brdu positive cells in the peripodial membrane being misinterpreted as disc proper cells, in all subsequent confocal projections we used ato expression as a reference for disc proper. the npr requires repression of cyclin e, de2f <dig> and cyclin a in drosophila, the main activators of s-phase entry are cyclin e <cit> , de2f <dig> <cit> and cyclin a <cit> . all are inactive in the npr and the protein levels of cyclins e and a are very low in this region <cit> . to examine the relative importance of the absence of these s-phase triggers in the maintenance of g <dig> arrest, we overexpressed them using the flip-out gal <dig> technique <cit> . this technique permits the direct comparison between overexpressing cells and neighbouring wild-type cells, thereby providing a more detailed view of the phenotype than is possible with simple gal <dig> misexpression. the ectopic expression of cyclin e induced brdu incorporation very efficiently in the anterior region of the npr . more rarely, we observed a few cells in s-phase in more posterior regions of the npr. cyclin e regulates de2f <dig> activity by inhibiting rbf <cit> , the drosophila homologue of the retinoblastoma factor. consistent with this, cells overexpressing cyclin e expressed the de2f <dig> reporter construct, pcna-gfp . overexpression of uas-de2f <dig> <cit> caused a weaker phenotype than cyclin e, although the pattern was similar: in this case, occasional brdu positive cells were seen but only in the anterior region of the npr . this result is consistent with the loss of function phenotype of rbf, the main inhibitor de2f <dig> activity, which causes ectopic s-phase cells only in the most anterior regions of the npr <cit> . taken together, the overexpression of cyclin e and de2f1/dp in the npr implies that at least one additional mechanism must promote g <dig> arrest in the posterior cells of the npr; unlike the anterior cells, they are refractory to overexpression of cyclin e or de2f1/dp. note that because of the progressive development of the retina, the anterior cells mature into the posterior cells, so this different responsiveness to cyclin e and de2f1/dp actually represents a developmental difference rather than a spatial one. the co-overexpression of uas-cyce and uas-de2f1/dp produced a slightly stronger phenotype than uas-cyce overexpression alone : s-phase is efficiently activated in the anterior but less so in the posterior part of the npr . this result is consistent with the earlier report that in clones mutant for both rbf and dap, inhibitors of de2f <dig> and cyclin e, respectively, the cells in the whole of the npr do not arrest <cit> ; in our hands these double mutant rbf dap clones can only sometimes induce ectopic brdu staining in the anterior region of the npr and have even weaker effects in the posterior region . we take the difference between the more powerful effect of ectopic cyclin e and de2f <dig> and the weaker effect of rbf dap to indicate that overexpression of activators is a more powerful trigger than removal of natural repressors. cyclin a has a less well defined role in s-phase activation but the evidence for its participation is nevertheless strong <cit> . interestingly, its overexpression in the npr gave a different result to cyclin e or de2f <dig> uas-cyca induced ectopic brdu staining in the whole width of the npr, but was most efficient in the most posterior domain, where cyclin e and de2f <dig> are less effective . the combination of both transgenes, uas-cyca and uas-cyce strongly induced ectopic s-phase entry in cells throughout the npr: almost all overexpressing cells failed to arrest in g <dig> . overall, our data provide strong evidence that g <dig> arrest in the npr is controlled by multiple mechanisms with distinct regional effects. specifically, in the anterior region of the npr, which corresponds to the early stages of g <dig> arrest, the repression of cyclin e and de2f <dig> activity is critically important, while in the posterior half, where the cells are more mature, the repression of cyclin a becomes necessary for the maintenance of these cells in the g <dig> phase. control of g <dig> arrest by hh and dpp the npr is the earliest visible change in cells as they enter the wave of development that will eventually produce the adult retina. ultimately, the whole wave of eye development is propagated by secreted dpp and hh signals. consistent with this, it has previously been reported that dpp is responsible for the g1-arrest in the anterior part of the npr <cit> ; most recently, firth and baker have reported that dpp and hh act redundantly to induce the whole npr <cit> . to understand the mechanism in detail by which dpp and hh cause cells to exit from proliferation and arrest/synchronise in g <dig> we genetically blocked the two pathways, either alone or together. we used mutations in thick veins , the dpp receptor; smoothened , the membrane associated transducer of hh signalling; mad, an essential intracellular transducer of dpp signalling; and ci, a nuclear effector of hh signalling. note that ci has constitutive repressor activity as well as being a hh-dependent activator <cit> , implying that loss of ci is not always equivalent to loss of smo. for this reason, simultaneous loss of smo and tkv represents the best way of analysing the loss-of-function phenotypes of the hh and dpp pathways in the eye disc <cit> . initial synchronisation of cells as they enter the npr one of the earliest signs of the npr is an increase in the number of mitotic cells immediately prior to the g <dig> arrest region. this is seen in wild type discs as a well defined line of phosphohistone h <dig> positive cells immediately anterior to the npr , and contrasts with the much more sparsely scattered ph3-positive cells further anterior. we observed that in the smo tkv double mutant clones this clear alignment of mitotic cells was lost , implying that cells were no longer being efficiently driven into mitosis. note that ph <dig> only stains cells in for a short period of the cell cycle, so its absence cannot be taken as a sign of proliferative arrest. instead we interpret this result to indicate a function for hh and dpp in accelerating through mitosis those cells that are already 'pre-mitotic' or in later stages of the cell cycle. a differential requirement for dpp and hh signalling in the posterior and anterior of the npr loss of smo alone causes a slight delay in entry to the npr, by one or two rows of cells, but no ectopic brdu staining occurs in the rest of the region <cit> . we examined clones of tkv as well as double mutant clones for mad ci, or tkv ci, or smo tkv . all four mutant conditions caused ectopic brdu incorporation and cyclin b expression in the anterior region of the npr but none caused significant ectopic s-phase induction in the posterior region . of these four conditions, smo tkv was the only one in which occasional brdu positive cells were detected in the posterior region . three points emerge from these data. first, they imply a clear difference between the maintenance of g <dig> in the anterior and posterior of the npr. second, firth and baker reported ectopic brdu incorporation and cyclin b accumulation in mad ci clones in the whole npr, not just the anterior region. we used the same alleles as they did but did not observe any posterior brdu staining. third, there is no evidence for a requirement for ci in this process: tkv ci clones are indistinguishable from clones of tkv alone. redundancy of smo and tkv in the regulation of de2f <dig> activity loss of tkv and smo together caused ectopic de2f <dig> activity in the whole npr , while loss of tkv alone activated de2f <dig> in the anterior region alone ; loss of smo alone had no effect on de2f <dig> activity . therefore both signals contribute, in a partially redundant manner, to the normal downregulation of de2f <dig> activity in the npr. note that this activation of de2f <dig> is not sufficient to induce ectopic s-phase entry in the posterior region of the npr , which is consistent with our observation above that ectopic de2f <dig> is also not sufficient to trigger s-phase in this same region. a non-redundant requirement for hh signalling in the expression of dacapo loss of smo alone abolished the expression of dacapo , an inhibitor of cyce activity <cit> . careful examination showed that dap expression begins in the posterior domain of the npr and remains detectable through to the posterior of the smw . we observed that dap expression disappears in the smo <dig> clones, but not in the tkva <dig> clones or ci <dig> clones . this implies that dap expression is not dependent on dpp signalling. the result with ci clones implies that, consistent with earlier reports <cit> , there is no positive role for ci in hh signalling in this context. we also observed dap down regulation when the constitutive ci repressor form, uas-cicell was overexpressed in clones . we therefore infer that hh signalling is needed to remove the ci repressor form in the npr, rather than directly activating dap expression. these genetic experiments with the hh and dpp pathways point to several substantial conclusions. 1) both pathways are required to promote the last coordinated mitosis previous to the g <dig> arrest. 2) g <dig> arrest in the anterior region of the npr depends primarily on dpp signalling. 3) more generally, g <dig> arrest is regulated differentially in the anterior and posterior of the npr; in neither region is ci-dependent activation required. 4) there is a redundancy between hh and dpp in the control of de2f <dig> activity in the posterior of the npr. 5) there is a non-redundant requirement for hh to activate dap expression in the posterior of the npr; this activation requires smo but, again, not ci. together, these data imply that while there is some redundancy between hh and dpp signalling in the control of the npr, non-overlapping functions can also be identified. they also imply that, contrary to an earlier report <cit> , hh and dpp signalling do not comprise the whole mechanism of g <dig> arrest: in the posterior region of the npr, some other factor must prevent cells from s-phase entry, even when hh and dpp signalling are completely blocked. a secondary role for atonal in maintaining g <dig> arrest? ato expression in the npr is induced by both hh and dpp pathways <cit> . together with the involvement of other proneural genes in g <dig> arrest in the wing margin <cit> , this suggests a possible role of this gene in the establishment of the npr. however, we did not observe ectopic brdu positive cells in ato loss-of-function clones encompassing the npr . on the other hand, about 55% of atonal overexpression clones showed a clear precocious entry into the npr , suggesting that atonal may influence mitotic progression prior in the npr. rux is necessary for the g <dig> arrest in the npr the observation that cyclin a overexpression induced brdu incorporation in the npr suggested that cyclin a inhibition is important for the arrest of these cells. we therefore examined the phenotype of removing roughex , a cytoplasmic inhibitor of cyclin a activity <cit> . rux mutant eye discs have increased proliferation anterior and posterior to the morphogenetic furrow <cit> . to dissect this phenotype precisely, we induced loss of function clones of the null allele rux <dig> in distinction to the loss of smo and tkv, cells in the most posterior part of the npr are no longer arrested in g <dig> demonstrated by the high number of cells that incorporate brdu and the accumulation of cyclin b ; anterior cells are affected only slightly and many remain arrested in g <dig> . this phenotype is similar to that obtained by overexpressing cyclin a and supports the idea that rux represses cyclin a activity and plays a significant role in maintaining g <dig> arrest, particularly in the posterior of the npr. rux <dig> clones also displayed slight ectopic activation of the pcna-gfp transgene in the npr suggesting that the powerful activation of s-phase in these clones might rely on more than just cyclin a activation. however, since rux is reported to be a specific regulator of cyclin a, and is therefore not expected to affect de2f <dig> activity directly, we tested whether this upregulation of de2f <dig> was triggered by cyclin a activity. indeed, cyclin a overexpression was also able to induce weakly the pcna reporter in the npr , suggesting that the slight gain of de2f <dig> activity in rux clones was indirect. rux antibodies are not sensitive enough to detect the endogenous protein by immunofluorescence, so the expression pattern of rux in the eye disc was analysed using a rux-lacz transgene that is able to rescue the rux phenotype and is therefore thought to represent faithfully the expression of the gene <cit> . rux-lacz is expressed generally in the eye disc, including in the npr, with a decrease just posterior to the morphogenetic furrow as the second mitotic wave initiates . expression of rux was not dependent on dpp or hh signalling: rux-lacz was not down-regulated in smo tkv double mutant clones. on the contrary, rux-lacz was elevated, indicating that hh and dpp normally repress rux expression in the second mitotic wave . this result is consistent with our other data that imply that hh and dpp are important determinants of g <dig> arrest only in the anterior domain of the npr. in the posterior domain, when the cells have developed further, cyclin a and rux become the key regulators of g <dig> arrest. discussion mitotic synchrony vs. g <dig> arrest in this paper we have focused on the mechanism of g <dig> arrest in the eye imaginal disc, the first overt sign of retinal differentiation. although the npr has sometimes been considered to be merely the beginning of the morphogenetic furrow, our 3d image analysis clearly shows that it initiates well before the cells alter their shape. just anterior to the cells arrested in g <dig> there is a increased number of mitotic cells suggesting a coordinated activation of their entry into mitosis. this could represent the subset of cells that are in s or g <dig> phases and that are accelerated through the cell cycle in order to become arrested in g <dig> we have shown that hh and dpp both have a novel role in this first mitotic synchronisation. this could be mediated by string since its rna is upregulated in these cells <cit> . obviously, not all cells will be poised to enter mitosis immediately upon receiving these signals but we imagine that their function is to drive cells through mitosis with as little delay as possible. based on several lines of published evidence and our data <cit> , we estimate that cells in the npr spend only a little more time in g <dig> phase than the proliferating anterior cells of the eye disc . coupled with the sharp onset of g1-arrest, this implies that the npr is at least partly a consequence of cells being triggered to enter g <dig> synchronously. however, the observation that the loss of tkv causes ectopic s-phase entry in the anterior part of the npr, and the fact that g1-phase is extended, albeit not greatly, both indicate the existence of a mechanism for preventing cells precociously entering s-phase in the npr. in other words, we conclude that the npr is a consequence of a combination of cell cycle synchronisation and specific arrest mechanisms. dpp and hh make distinct contributions to g <dig> arrest the data presented here, coupled with several previous reports, point to the control of the npr being dependent on multiple inputs. the earliest stage we observe is the hh and dpp-dependent wave of mitosis that immediately precedes the npr; this synchronises cells at the start of the npr. immediately afterwards, the trigger for cells to not re-enter s-phase is primarily dpp, which is secreted by cells immediately posterior to the mf and diffuses anteriorly to exert its effects <cit> . we see little evidence for substantial hh involvement in this g <dig> initiation step. later in development, and therefore more posteriorly in the npr, there is again more pronounced redundancy between dpp and hh, in the regulation of de2f <dig> activity. tkv mutant cells show ectopic de2f <dig> activity in the anterior region of the npr but not in the posterior region. cells that are mutant for both tkv and smo, however, activate de2f <dig> across the whole npr, indicating that in the posterior region, a combination of dpp and hh signalling contributes to g <dig> arrest. the distinction between the regulation of g <dig> arrest in anterior and posterior regions of the npr, an indication that as cells mature their requirements change, is further emphasised by the non-redundant posterior requirement of smo for the expression of dacapo, a cyclin e inhibitor. this implies that hh signalling from the cells posterior to the furrow contributes to g <dig> arrest in the final stages of the npr, although loss of this signalling does not induce s-phase. this illustrates a major theme of our work, that g <dig> arrest in the npr is maintained by multiple mechanisms. overall, one of the main conclusions we draw from these data is that, together, dpp and hh exert precise regulation of two s-phase activators, cyclin e and de2f <dig> both of which must be kept in check in the npr. our data also suggest that atonal might play a secondary role in the onset of the npr. although loss of ato alone does not affect the npr, indicating that the g <dig> arrest induced by hh, dpp and rux does not absolutely require atonal function, we found that the overexpression of ato just anterior to the npr, can sometimes accelerate g <dig> entry. interestingly, this is similar to the phenotype of ci lof clones <cit> in which there is this precocious entry into g <dig> as ci clones show an upregulation of ato , this provides a possible explanation of the earlier result. the core cell cycle components that we have analysed are of course widely conserved, as are their functions. in this paper we have focused on the precise regulation of g <dig> arrest in one tissue – the eye imaginal disc – where hh and dpp induce development. comparing our data with what has been shown in other systems, we conclude that different signalling pathways are used to regulate the cell cycle machinery in different contexts. the important point is that a precise and highly regulated set of developmental signals are used to ensure proper control of g <dig> and s-phase entry. repression of cyclin a is necessary for g <dig> arrest the central role of dpp and hh signalling in initiating mitotic synchrony and maintaining g <dig> arrest in the npr is consistent with the primary and exclusive role these signals have in driving the progress of eye development. it was therefore a surprise to find that blocking dpp and hh reception was not sufficient to trigger s-phase efficiently in posterior cells of the npr. this particular conclusion contradicts that of firth and baker <cit> , who ascribed g <dig> arrest fully to dpp and hh-dependent processes. we do not know the cause of this disagreement but note that we have included their mutant stock in our study and obtained a different result from that which they report. in addition, our results are consistent with earlier data that de-repression of cyclin e and de2f <dig> is not sufficient to induce s-phase entry in the posterior of the npr: for example, ectopic brdu incorporation was seen in anterior regions of the npr in clones of cells mutant for the cyclin e inhibitors dap and archipelago, and the de2f <dig> inhibitor, rbf. even in double mutant clones that derepress cyclin e and de2f <dig> there is only a weak activation of s-phase in the posterior . together, these experiments confirm that the inhibitors of cyclin e and de2f <dig> are present and contribute to g <dig> arrest in the npr. however, the relatively weak phenotype of their loss emphasises the presence of another inhibitory factor, which we have shown to be the dedicated inhibitor of cyclin a, rux. loss of rux or overexpression of cyclin a was sufficient to trigger ectopic s-phases, even when normal dpp and hh signals were present. importantly, we have shown that rux expression does not require dpp and hh signalling, implying that control of the npr by cyclin a is distinct from that by cyclin e and de2f <dig> since rux is expressed across the whole of the npr territory, we envisage that it may provide a fixed barrier to s-phase entry, which must be overcome when cells legitimately enter s-phase in the second mitotic wave. consistent with this view of rux function, we observed no disturbance of the entry of cells into the npr in rux mutants . this importance of cyclin a further supports the growing body of evidence for an s-phase function for this more famously mitotic cyclin. this role also has been clearly identified in mammals where, although there is not a rux homologue, there are multiple controls that mediate cyclin a inhibition in g1-phase. CONCLUSIONS from a synthesis of our data with previous work, we propose the following outline of the full course of events that lead to the regulated synchronisation and arrest of proliferation in the npr. as the morphogenetic furrow advances towards more anterior cells, they first experience the secreted dpp and hh signals that induce a coordinated entry into mitosis . after that, dpp causes them to downregulate cyclin e levels and de2f <dig> activity, thereby preventing s-phase entry and arresting them in g <dig> as the approaching furrow gets closer, and the cells mature in the posterior region of the npr, other controls come into play. most notably, hh secreted from cells posterior to the furrow upregulates dap expression, further ensuring the inactivity of cyclin e. hh also contributes at this stage to the repression of de2f <dig> in addition to these signal dependent controls, rux contributes to g <dig> maintenance by its inhibition of cyclin a. this overlapping set of mechanisms for ensuring that cells do not enter s-phase precociously appears strangely complex and redundant. presumably this is a measure of the importance of this developmental regulation of proliferation. in the posterior region of the npr, cells must prepare themselves for imminent changes as they begin either to differentiate as photoreceptors, or to re-enter s-phase for the terminal division of the second mitotic wave. these later decisions are precisely controlled by an overlapping and reiterated set of signals, including hh and dpp themselves <cit> . the mechanism by which the same signals are used reiteratively to specify distinct fates could be confusing to a cell and is not fully understood by us, but is thought to rely on distinct transcriptional consequences of signals received by cells at different stages of their development. perhaps the addition of cyclin a repression and dap expression in this important transitional region adds a failsafe mechanism to ensure the precise onset of retinal differentiation.",

    "prompt": "Provide a concise recap of the clinical trial results. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND accurate outcome estimation is often the key in the successful treatment of cancer patients. estimation depends on clinical or laboratory variables or factors that are linked to patient outcome. found in all specialties of medicine, predictive factors take on significant clinical meaning when treatment options are available, but they become more important if treatment options are limited and not always effective. currently, the most common predictive factors in cancer medicine are the three variables t , n, and m of the tnm staging system that define the anatomic extent of disease <cit> . the \"t\" usually refers to the size of the primary tumor, \"n\" refers to the presence or absence of metastatic deposits in regional lymph nodes, and \"m\" indicates the presence of metastatic disease. with the tnm staging system, levels of these three variables are combined, and patients are classified into four stage groups according to different combinations of the levels. then the outcome estimation of patients is based on the survival function estimated for each stage. the tnm was created by surgeons primarily for surgery. however, cancer medicine no longer lives in the world where surgery remains the only treatment. the field of cancer is now characterized by screening and early detection, proteogenomics, multiple therapies, and a bewildering array of prognostic factors. advances in molecular medicine, imaging, and therapeutics are now forcing us to integrate additional prognostic factors for more accurate estimation of patient outcome <cit> . therefore, to improve the estimation of outcome, methods are needed to incorporate additional prognostic factors into the tnm without changing the anatomic definitions. the ensemble algorithm for clustering cancer data by chen et al. <cit> is designed to explore expansion of the tnm by integrating additional factors into the system. though many results on using eaccd have been reported, there has been no study available to analyze the algorithm. in this report, we present an analysis of eaccd by using a large breast cancer dataset. we compared the output of eaccd with the corresponding survival curves, investigated the effect of different settings for eaccd, and compared eaccd with several other clustering approaches. this report represents an extensive expansion of the work in <cit> . method eaccd in this section, we describe the eaccd. our presentation allows a collection of partition methods in constructing dissimilarities and thus is more general than that in <cit> . let the record for the ith patient be , where xi <dig> equals the observed time , xij are measurements on variables xj for j = <dig> ... , p, and δj is the event indicator which is defined to be <dig> if the event has occurred and <dig> if the time on study is right-censored. define a combination to be a set of that corresponds to one level of each variable . eaccd is an algorithm used to cluster combinations. in the algorithm, dissimilarity between two combinations is learnt by repeatedly using some clustering approaches based on criterion minimization, and then the learnt dissimilarity measure is used with a hierarchical clustering method in order to find final clusters of combinations. the algorithm involves the following three steps. computing initial dissimilarity assume that there are a total of n combinations x <dig> x <dig> ... , xn. then the following initial dissimilarity measure dis <dig> is defined between two combinations xi and xi': dis0=d <dig> here d <dig> is the value of a test statistic used to determine if three is a difference in the survival functions between the two populations associated with xi and xi'. in general, dis <dig> assumes any non-negative value. computing learnt dissimilarity let c denote a cluster assignment, assigning the ith combination to a cluster, i.e., c ∈ minc,ik1k ∑k=1k∑c=kdis0xi,xik. numerical procedures <cit> ) are employed to find the solution to the above optimization problem. for the data {x <dig> x <dig> ... , xn}, one k and one clustering or partitioning method may be chosen to partition the data into k clusters. however, the final assignment usually depends on the selected method and the initial reallocation. to overcome this, one can run this partition process m times. each time a number k is randomly picked from a given interval and a partitioning procedure is also randomly selected. define δl = <dig> if the lth run of a procedure does not assign xi and xj into the same cluster; and δl = <dig> otherwise. and then define the following dissimilarity measure between two combinations xi and xj: dis=∑l=1nδlm. note that dis ranges from <dig> to <dig> a smaller value of dis indicates that xi and xj most likely come from the same \"hidden\" group. in other words, a smaller dissimilarity dis is expected to imply a smaller difference between the two survival functions associated with the two combinations. hierarchical clustering this step clusters the combinations by applying a linkage method <cit> and the learnt dissimilarity dis. the primary output of eaccd is a dendrogram that provides a summary of the survival experiences based on the levels of prognostic factors, and thus has multiple applications. the algorithm is outlined in algorithm <dig> note that if only pam is used for computing the learnt dissimilarity, then the algorithm reduces to that introduced in <cit> . data set a breast cancer patient dataset was obtained from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program of the national cancer institute <cit> . because of its size, quality control, broad us representation, unbiased ascertainment, and 35-year history, the program is ideal for evaluating algorithms. we selected data for breast cancer from the years 1990- <dig> using seer's case listing. during the selection process, we followed the definitions for tumor size and number of involved lymph nodes as published by the american joint committee on cancer <cit> . the dataset contained <dig> <dig> cases having complete records on t , n , x , and δ . the factors t and n have <dig> and <dig> categories, respectively, as listed in table <dig> therefore there are <dig> combinations based on t and n. and for convenience, we denoted by t1n <dig> the combination formed using categories t <dig> and n <dig> by t1n <dig> the combination formed using categories t <dig> and n <dig> and so on. t2 2 n1 n2 2 3 algorithm <dig> ensemble algorithm for clustering cancer patient data <dig> define the initial dissimilarity dis <dig> in . <dig> obtain a collection of procedures for solving . choose m, k <dig> and k <dig> and run these procedures m times, where for each time, a procedure is randomly selected from the collection and a k is randomly chosen from the interval . then construct the pairwise dissimilarity measure dis by using the equation . <dig> cluster the combinations by applying a linkage method and the learnt measure dis. evaluation of eaccd we evaluated eaccd by performing a series of experiments using the programming language \"r\" <cit> . the pam algorithm was used in the second step of eaccd throughout the evaluation. random medoids were initially selected for the pam in all cases except for a <dig> described below, where the default initial medoids in \"r\" were used. the evaluation began with the application of the algorithm to clustering the breast cancer patients. we examined how the algorithm grouped the patients and compared this grouping with the possible grouping pattern exhibited in the survival curve plot. for the experiments, the log-rank test statistic <cit> was used to determine the initial dissimilarity in the first step of the algorithm. in the second step we chose k <dig> = <dig> k <dig> = <dig> . the pam algorithm was repeatedly executed for m = <dig> times. in the third step, the average linkage hierarchical clustering technique <cit> was used. we then examined the effect of different settings in eaccd on the dendrogram generated by the algorithm. there were mainly three \"factors\" that could influence the final result in eaccd: test , m and the linkage function . the effects of these \"factors\" were analyzed by varying their \"values.\" while the value of m was chosen from { <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> 30000}, we considered three tests and three linkage functions . finally, we compared eaccd with four additional approaches that could be used to cluster the cancer patient data. these approaches were either straight forward or modifications of eaccd. specifically the four approaches a <dig> a <dig> a <dig> a <dig> are described below. for demonstration, we used m = <dig> the log-rank test, and the average linkage for the setting of eaccd. approach a1 this was tailored from the eaccd, omitting the learning step for dissimilarity. the initial dissimilarity measure dis <dig> in was obtained first using the log-rank test and then standardized into <dig> <cit> by the equation disa1s=dis0/max{dis0}. the standardized initial dissimilarity values were then used in the hierarchical clustering procedure with the average linkage function. approach a2 in testing the differences between two survival curves associated with two combinations, a smaller p-value normally indicates a larger difference between the survival curves. therefore, <dig> − p, ranging from <dig> to <dig> could be used as the pairwise dissimilarity measure between two combinations in light of the survival. in the approach of a <dig> this dissimilarity <dig> − p, from the log-rank test, was directly used in the hierarchical clustering procedure with the average linkage function. the learning step for dissimilarity was not required. approach a3 in a <dig> we considered one traditional procedure in clustering the cancer data by using the two factors t and n. for each combination, let t^ denote the average value of t and n ^ the average value of n. we could use t ^ and n ^ to represent the t and n value of the combination, respectively. since t ^ has a much larger range than n ^, a linear transformation was performed to standardize t ^ and n ^ into <dig> <cit> as t ^s = / and n ^s = /. let t ^is and n ^is be the standardized values for combination xi. then the dissimilarity between combinations xi and xj was defined as dis=|t ^is=t ^js|+n ^is-n ^js|. this dissimilarity dis was then standardized into the range of <dig> <cit> using disa3s=dis/max{dis}. based on disa3s, hierarchical clustering with the average linkage was then performed. approach a4 in a <dig> the pam clustering algorithm was directly used to partition the cancer data. the quantity disa1s in the approach a <dig> was taken as the input dissimilarity measurement. the number of clusters was set at <dig> ... , <dig> respectively, and thus <dig> partition results were available. RESULTS an application study eaccd, when applied to the breast cancer data, generated a dendrogram ) that exhibits one relationship among <dig> survival curves corresponding to the <dig> combinations. more specifically, the dendrogram provided an overall view of the relationship among the outcomes as the levels of prognostic factors were changed. we begin with the leftmost side or branch of figure <dig> the dissimilarity between the survival curve of t1n <dig> and the survival curve of t3n <dig> is <dig> . merge t1n <dig> with t3n <dig> and denote by t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> the resulting group of patients. then the difference between the survival curve of t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> and the survival curve of t2n <dig> is <dig> . merge t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> with t2n <dig> and denote the resulting group of patients by t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> then in light of survival, this group t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> differs from t3n <dig> by a value of <dig> . merging t3n <dig> with t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> and denoting the resulting group by t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> then t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> differs from t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> by a value of <dig> in terms of survival. here t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> is the group from merging t2n <dig> with t3n <dig> where t2n <dig> differs from t3n <dig> by a value of <dig> . denote by t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> the result from merging t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> and t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> the above shows the relationship among the survival curves of the combinations contained in the left branch of the dendrogram. a similar interpretation applies to the survival curves of the combinations in the right branch of the dendrogram. finally, the left branch differs from the right branch by a value of <dig> in light of survival. that is, <dig> is the difference between the survival curve of the group t1n <dig> + t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t1n <dig> + t2n <dig> + t1n <dig> and the survival curve of the group t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> the relationship among the survival curves exhibited in the dendrogram of t and n ) can be confirmed by visually checking the <dig> survival curves shown in figure <dig> these survival curves were constructed by the kaplan-meier procedure <cit> . the survival curves in figure <dig> can be divided into two groups, group <dig> consisting of the lower six curves and group <dig> consisting of the upper six curves. the curves in group <dig> and group <dig> appear on the left and right branches in figure <dig> respectively of the dendrogram. thus, from a practical perspective, the dendrogram initially divides the patients into those with a favorable outcome and those with an unfavorable outcome. a visual check of group <dig> in figure <dig> shows certain differences among the curves. for instance, the two closest curves are the curve of t2n <dig> and the curve of t3n <dig> and the next two closest curves are the curves of t1n <dig> and t3n <dig> if we merge combinations in the order of increasing differences between survival rates, we would first merge t2n <dig> with t3n <dig> and then merge t1n <dig> with t3n <dig> merge t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> with t2n <dig> merge t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> with t3n <dig> and finally, merge t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> with t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> clearly, this observation coincides with the relationship among survival curves depicted by the left branch of the dendrogram in figure <dig> similarly, the right branch of the dendrogram captures the survival differences and the order of merging of the six curves in group <dig> effect of settings on eaccd effect of m the learnt dissimilarity \"dis\" in eaccd depends on the values of m, which will be convergent when m is sufficiently large. if on the the other hand, m is small, the dissimilarity is not convergent and can be regarded as a variable. thus, the resulting dendrograms will not be robust. specifically, for a small value of m, multiple runs of eaccd with the same test and same linkage may produce significantly different dendrograms. this is shown in figures <dig> and <dig> however, when m is large, the dendrograms for the same test and same linkage are virtually the same. for example, when m = <dig> <dig> <dig> the dendrograms , , ) based on the gehan-wilcoxon's test and the complete linkage are similar, and the dendrograms , , ) based on the tarone-ware's test and the single linkage are almost identical. therefore, a large m should be used when applying eaccd. effect of tests and linkage functions we further examined the effect of statistical tests for large values of m. figure <dig> lists nine dendrograms for m = <dig> the log-rank test, the gehan-wilcoxon's test, the tarone and ware's test, the average linkage, the complete linkage, and the single linkage. there were two observations, drawn by visualizing the figure horizontally and vertically. first, for a given test, the dendrograms based on different linkage functions exhibit the same merging pattern, but merging or fusion can occur at significantly different dissimilarity values. for example, with the log-rank test, the dendrogram from the average linkage has the same shape and merging pattern as the dendrogram from the complete linkage. for the average linkage, t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> is merged with t1n <dig> + t3n <dig> + t2n <dig> + t3n <dig> at the dissimilarity of <dig> . but that fusion occurs at the dissimilarity of <dig> for the complete linkage. second, for a given linkage, the dendrograms derived from different tests are virtually the same, which indicates that for a given linkage, test statistics have minimal influence on the dendrogram. for instance, figures <dig> , and <dig> essentially show the same dendrogram for the average linkage and three tests . in summary, our experiments have shown that a large m should be used in eaccd. for a large m, different linkage functions can generate different dendrograms. but different statistical tests have minimal or no influence on the dendrogram. comparisons with alternative approaches approach a1 for approach a <dig> a hierarchical clustering procedure with the average linkage was applied directly to the breast cancer data. the dissimilarity was determined by the value of the log-rank test statistic. the dendrogram is shown in figure <dig> it indicates that t1n <dig> becomes a separate group. the reason for this is stated as follows. consider the set s containing all the dissimilarities between one survival function and its \"nearest\" neighbor, which is identified visually from figure <dig> computation shows that the dissimilarity between t1n <dig> and its nearest neighbor t1n <dig> is the maximum of s and it is nearly <dig> times larger than the second largest value in s. according to the construction of the dendrogram, t1n <dig> is merged with the group of all the other eleven combinations at the last step in the hierarchical clustering procedure. note that the combination t1n <dig> contains significantly more patients than any other combination ). other experiments showed that if the number of patients in t1n <dig> was reduced to a quantity comparable with the number of patients in other combinations, dendrograms from the approach a <dig> would have the same shape and merging pattern as in figure <dig> this suggests that a <dig> is sensitive to the relative size of the combinations. approach a2 the approach a <dig> also used a hierarchical clustering procedure with the average linkage to directly cluster the breast cancer data. but in this approach, the dissimilarity was obtained by the p-value from the log-rank test. the dendrogram, shown in figure <dig> indicates that the merging steps on the top are not obvious for several combinations. the reason is simply that the dissimilarity <dig> − p is <dig> for most pairs of combinations, due to the rounding effect in computation. approach a3 we employed a <dig> to cluster the data by using only t and n. survival times were not used with this approach. the corresponding dendrogram is shown in figure <dig> comparing figure <dig> with the survival curve plot in figure <dig> we can observe that the merging pattern described in the dendrogram at low levels of dissimilarity does not seem reasonable. for instance, the dendrogram indicates that t2n <dig> and t1n <dig> merge first and then they merge with t3n <dig> to form a group without t3n <dig> which is not reasonable in light of figure <dig> therefore the traditional clustering procedure using t and n does not work here. the reason might be that t and n together could not capture the main information regarding the survival of cancer patients. the approach a <dig> can be modified by incorporating the learning step, as in eaccd. one modification, denoted by a3*, is obtained by replacing dis <dig> in the first step of eaccd by disa3s and then following steps <dig> and <dig> in eaccd with the average linkage. figure <dig> shows the dendrogram , which again presents unreasonable grouping assignments. approach a4 we ran the pam algorithm to directly partition the breast cancer data for the number of clusters set at each of the following figures: <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and we obtained the corresponding partition by cutting off the dendrogram in figure <dig> comparisons showed that the results from the pam and eaccd were the same except for the case where the number of clusters was <dig> table <dig> lists the partition results for four clusters from both methods, where a higher group number means a smaller survival in the group. comparing the table with figure <dig> we see that the four clusters from eaccd are reasonable. however, groups <dig> and <dig> from the pam show a separation of t2n <dig> from t1n <dig> which should be placed into the same group as indicated by the survival plot ). therefore, partition of the data from eaccd is more consistent with the survival curves than that from the pam. in summary, the results of these comparisons have shown that 1) if the step for learning dissimilarity is omitted in eaccd, then the resulting approaches can have a degraded performance, 2) if survival times are not taken into account, then clustering based on prognostic factors will likely generate misleading dendrograms, and 3) direct applications of partitioning techniques to the data can lead to misleading assignments to clusters. CONCLUSIONS this report presents a three pronged analysis of eaccd based on a breast cancer patient dataset. first, we examined whether grouping patients by eaccd was consistent with the \"natural\" grouping of survival curves derived directly from the data. second, we investigated the effect of different settings in eaccd. third, we compared eaccd with other clustering approaches. the results showed that if only the pam is employed for learning dissimilarity, large values of m should be used with eaccd and that dendrograms generated from eaccd with the pam and a large m primarily depend on the linkage functions and not on the statistical tests that are used in the learning step. the results also showed that eaccd can be applied to cancer patient data to obtain meaningful dendrograms. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions rq conceived the study and carried out the experiments. dw conceived the study and carried out the experiments. ls participated in the design of the study. dh prepared the data set, examined the dendrograms, and participated in the design of the study. as prepared the data set, examined the dendrograms, and participated in the design of the study. ex participated in the experiments. xl conceived the study. dc conceived, designed and guided the study, and wrote the manuscript. all authors have read and approved the final manuscript.",

    "prompt": "Generate a concise overview of the medical abstract. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND the mutation responsible for the callipyge trait is located within an imprinted gene cluster on the distal end of ovine chromosome <dig> <cit> . the callipyge phenotype is associated with an altered carcass composition including a 30–40% increase in muscle mass, a 6–7% decrease in carcass fat, decreased organ weights, and a more compact skeleton, all without a net affect on animal growth <cit> . there is a pronounced hypertrophy of muscles in the loin and pelvic limbs and a lesser degree of hypertrophy in muscles of the thoracic limbs <cit> . the callipyge phenotype is inherited in a non-mendelian mode termed polar overdominance <cit> in which only animals that inherit a normal allele from the dam and the mutant callipyge allele from the sire exhibit the callipyge phenotype. maternal heterozygotes and callipyge allele homozygotes have muscling and carcass compositions that are similar to normal sheep . a physical contig spanning the region containing the callipyge mutation was constructed using overlapping ovine bacterial artificial chromosomes <cit> and <dig> kb of sequence was obtained from the contig <cit> . comparisons of the ovine sequence to the human genome sequence and to expressed sequence databases indicated the presence of at least six transcribed genes with allele-specific expression <cit> . the gene order along the contig was found to be delta-like <dig> , dlk associated transcript , gene-trap locus <dig> , paternal expressed gene <dig> and maternal expressed gene <dig> . the same conserved gene order was also found as an imprinted domain on human chromosome <dig> and mouse chromosome <dig> <cit> . the dlk <dig> locus encodes a transmembrane protein that contains epidermal-growth factor repeats <cit> . cleavage of the extracellular domain of dlk <dig> produces the circulating protein fetal antigen- <dig> <cit> . dat is a short non-coding rna that has been proposed to be a cleavage product of extended dlk <dig> transcripts <cit> . both dlk1and dat are expressed from the paternal allele <cit> . gtl <dig> and meg <dig> genes express non-coding rna from the maternal allele <cit> . the peg <dig> gene contains an intronless open reading frame of <dig> amino acids in sheep <cit> . the human and mouse orthologues known as retrotransposon-like <dig> encode <dig> and <dig> amino acids, respectively. rna transcripts were detected from the opposite strand of the same gene, referred to as peg11as <cit> . in the mouse, two maternally expressed micrornas have been identified with perfect complementarity to mouse rtl <dig> <cit> . the causative mutation for callipyge is a single base transition of a to g in the intergenic region located between dlk <dig> and gtl <dig> <cit> . this mutation has been shown to be 100% concordant with all animals of the +mat/clpgpat genotype based on haplotype analysis <cit> . analysis of sheep from <dig> different breeds as well as <dig> mammalian species revealed a highly conserved <dig> base sequence that includes the single nucleotide polymorphism <cit> . the g polymorphism is unique to direct descendents of the first known callipyge animal, a ram named \"solid gold\". this animal was mosaic for the mutation <cit> , providing strong evidence that this single nucleotide polymorphism is the causative mutation. initial results indicate that the mutation alters the expression of several of the genes within the imprinted cluster <cit> when they are inherited in cis without altering their parent-of-origin-specific expression <cit> . in this study, we analyzed the expression of five genes within the callipyge cluster in the muscles of lambs of all four genotypes. quantitative analysis of gene expression using a series of orthogonal contrasts showed that dlk <dig> peg <dig> and meg <dig> exhibited a polar overdominant pattern of gene expression. the expression of peg <dig> and peg11as transcripts in the muscles of paternal heterozygous callipyge lambs was different from the other three genotypes. a sense/antisense interaction of peg <dig> and peg11as, such as an rna interference mechanism, would be consistent with a trans interaction between reciprocally imprinted genes that has been previously proposed as a mechanism for polar overdominance <cit> . RESULTS northern blot analysis muscle samples were collected from 12- and 8-week-old lambs, when muscle hypertrophy is well established in animals with the callipyge phenotype. total rna was extracted from three muscles that undergo hypertrophy including longissimus dorsi , semimembranosus, and gluteus medius , and one muscle that does not undergo hypertrophy, the supraspinatus, . strand specific probes were used to analyze peg <dig> and peg11as expression. hybridization of longissimus dorsi, semimembranosus and gluteus medius northern blots with a peg <dig> probe indicated expression of a <dig> kb peg <dig> transcript in paternal heterozygotes that was not readily detectable in the other three genotypes . two smaller peg11as transcripts of <dig> kb and <dig> kb were detected in the two genotypes with maternally inherited callipyge alleles by a probe from the complementary strand. peg <dig> and peg11as transcripts were not detected in the supraspinatus. the expression of dlk <dig> was detectable at various levels in each of the four muscles and all four genotypes, although dlk <dig> appeared to be up-regulated in the loin and pelvic limb muscles of +mat/clpgpat and clpgmat/clpgpat animals . gtl <dig> transcripts of around <dig> kb were evident in the clpgmat/+pat and clpgmat/clpgpat genotypes. a distinct <dig> kb gtl <dig> transcript was consistently detected in the +mat/clpgpat genotype and no gtl <dig> transcripts were detected in the +/+ genotype. a <dig> kb meg <dig> transcript was expressed to a lesser degree than gtl <dig> in the clpgmat/+pat and clpgmat/clpgpat genotypes and was also detectable in the +mat/clpgpat genotype. the expression pattern of meg <dig> was the least consistent in the northern blot analysis of individuals of the four genotypes. peg11/peg11as ribonuclease protection assays were performed using five riboprobes to map the peg <dig> and peg11as transcripts to the contig sequence . the results for riboprobe p confirm the expression of peg <dig> transcripts in the gluteus medius of +mat/clpgpat animals and showed a very low level of peg <dig> in the gluteus medius of clpgmat/clpgpat animals. peg11as transcripts were readily detectable in animals of the +/+, clpgmat/+pat and clpgmat/clpgpat genotypes but were slightly above background levels in the +mat/clpgpat animals . two other peg <dig> probes from the open reading frame and from the 3'utr showed equivalent results to riboprobe p in the gluteus medius . the same expression pattern was seen for peg <dig> and peg11as transcripts in the supraspinatus, but signal from the protected riboprobes was just above background level. two probes from upstream of the peg <dig> coding sequence did not detect any peg <dig> transcripts, indicating that transcription of the <dig> kb peg <dig> was initiated within <dig> bp of the start codon of the open reading frame. riboprobe f detected peg11as transcripts in the gluteus medius and supraspinatus of all four genotypes, with the lowest expression in the paternal heterozygous animals. the peg11as riboprobe g shows three protected fragments, suggesting variable splice junctions or transcription termination sites for peg11as transcripts. quantitative analysis of the effect of genotype on gene expression gene expression was measured in the gluteus medius and supraspinatus of <dig> week-old animals using quantitative pcr. the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was not significantly different across the four genotypes in the gluteus medius and supraspinatus , indicating that equivalent amounts of rna were used for cdna synthesis and quantitative pcr. the effect of the callipyge mutation on genotype-specific expression of dlk <dig> and peg <dig> in gluteus medius was the same although the magnitude of the response was greater for peg <dig> than dlk <dig> . the paternal heterozygous animals had the highest transcript abundance , followed by clpgmat/clpgpat animals, which had significantly greater transcript abundance than clpgmat/+pat or +/+ animals. the mrna abundance of dlk <dig> in the gluteus medius was 6-fold and <dig> -fold greater in +mat/clpgpat lambs and clpgmat/clpgpat lambs respectively, relative to normal lambs . peg <dig> mrna abundance in the gluteus medius was 200-fold and 13-fold greater in +mat/clpgpat lambs and clpgmat/clpgpat lambs respectively, relative to normal lambs . the effect of the callipyge mutation on dlk <dig> and peg <dig> expression in the supraspinatus was different . no differences in dlk <dig> transcript abundance in the supraspinatus were found among the four genotypes . although not statistically analyzed, the level of dlk <dig> expression was similar between the gluteus medius and supraspinatus . peg <dig> expression in the supraspinatus had a different genotype-specific pattern than in the gluteus medius. peg <dig> expression was elevated 150-fold in +mat/clpgpat animals but was not significantly changed in the other three genotypes . the transcript abundance of peg <dig> in supraspinatus was generally much lower than in gluteus medius of the same genotype. peg <dig> expression in the supraspinatus was 12-fold lower than in the gluteus medius of paternal heterozygous animals . maternal inheritance of the callipyge allele significantly altered the expression of meg <dig> but not peg11as in the gluteus medius . transcript abundance of meg <dig> in gluteus medius was 6-fold greater in the clpgmat/+pat and clpgmat/clpgpat animals relative to the +mat/clpgpat and +/+ animals . expression of meg <dig> in the supraspinatus was also affected by the callipyge mutation but to a lesser degree . the homozygous callipyge animals had significantly higher meg <dig> transcript abundance than paternal heterozygotes, but those two genotypes were not significantly different from maternal heterozygotes and homozygous wild type lambs. orthogonal contrasts were used to analyze different models of gene action for the genes that had a significant effect for genotype . the polar overdominance contrast was significant for transcript abundances of dlk <dig> peg <dig> and meg <dig> in gluteus medius and for peg <dig> and meg <dig> in the supraspinatus. the additive contrasts were also significant for dlk <dig> peg <dig> and meg <dig> in gluteus medius but were only significant for peg <dig> in supraspinatus. the maternal dominance contrast was significant for dlk <dig> and peg <dig> gluteus medius. discussion our results show a clear pattern of increased expression for genes within the imprinted callipyge cluster in muscles that become hypertrophied, whereas expression of these genes was either reduced or absent in a muscle that does not become hypertrophied. the increased gene expression occurred when the mutation was inherited in cis and was dependent on each gene's imprinting status, consistent with previous reports <cit> . these results support the hypothesis that the mutation has disrupted a long range control element <cit> . two paternally expressed genes, dlk <dig> and peg <dig> had significantly increased transcript abundance when a callipyge allele was inherited from the sire. one maternally expressed gene, meg <dig> showed significantly increased transcript abundance when the callipyge allele was inherited from the dam. the changes in gene expression were sustained until <dig> weeks of age, when the differences in growth and body composition between callipyge and normal lamb are established and are subsequently maintained <cit> . northern blot analysis suggests that expression of gtl <dig> and peg11as was increased by maternal inheritance of the callipyge allele. quantitative analysis was not done for gtl <dig> in this study due to the expression of numerous alternatively spliced transcripts that have been reported for mice and sheep <cit> . the <dig> kb gtl <dig> mrna seen in this study consisted of a heterogeneous population of alternatively spliced mrnas. similarly, two peg11as transcripts were detected over a <dig> kb area extending from beyond the 5' end of the peg <dig> transcript to the 3'utr. the <dig> and <dig> kb peg11as transcripts detected by northern blot analysis using probe p would not be protected by probes c or g unless the peg11as transcripts undergo intron splicing or there are other transcripts that were not detected in the northern blots. therefore, the effect of the callipyge mutation on gtl <dig> and peg11as will require a more extensive analysis to fully elucidate their expression patterns in the four genotypes and determine their role in the callipyge model. due to their paternal allele-specific expression, the dlk <dig> and peg <dig> genes are both candidates for an effector gene that is responsible for the skeletal muscle hypertrophy exhibited by paternal heterozygous animals. in this study, both genes showed a polar overdominant expression pattern in that paternal heterozygotes had significantly higher levels of gene expression than the other three genotypes. the major differences between dlk <dig> and peg <dig> were the magnitude and the muscle specificity of the up-regulation. dlk <dig> was readily detectable in all muscles and genotypes by northern blot, but the up-regulation in paternal heterozygous animals was restricted to muscles of the loin and pelvic limb. the quantitative results showed a 6-fold increase in dlk <dig> transcript abundance in the gluteus medius and no change of dlk <dig> abundance in the supraspinatus. this pattern of gene expression is consistent with studies on individual muscle growth that show significant muscle hypertrophy in the gluteus medius but not in the supraspinatus <cit> . dlk <dig> transcripts were significantly increased in the gluteus medius of clpgmat/clpgpat animals, which do not exhibit muscle hypertrophy. the lack of a phenotype in clpgmat/clpgpat animals could be due to a threshold effect that requires more than a <dig> -fold increase in dlk <dig> transcript abundance to change muscle growth. the expression of peg <dig> was very low in the gluteus medius and supraspinatus of normal sheep and was induced in both muscles of callipyge lambs. northern blot analysis, ribonuclease protection assay and quantitative pcr results all show that the expression of peg <dig> and peg11as transcripts was much lower in the supraspinatus than the other muscles. the high level of expression of peg <dig> in the gluteus medius relative to the supraspinatus of callipyge lambs indicates that peg <dig> could also be the gene responsible for muscle hypertrophy if there is a threshold level required to change muscle growth. the peg <dig> gene has a long intronless open reading frame but it is not known if a protein is produced or what function it may have. the overdominant nature of the callipyge phenotype through the lack of muscle hypertrophy in animals with the clpgmat/clpgpat genotype is one of the more intriguing aspects of the trait and has led to a hypothesis of trans effects by other reciprocally imprinted genes in the callipyge region <cit> . if the peg <dig> gene has a direct role in muscle hypertrophy, either alone or in concert with dlk <dig> then peg11as may have a role in a trans effect on peg <dig> expression. in +mat/clpgpat animals, peg <dig> transcripts were 14-fold and 4-fold more abundant than peg11as transcripts in the gluteus medius and supraspinatus respectively. peg11as transcripts were more abundant than peg <dig> transcripts in the other three genotypes for both muscles. therefore, the relative abundance of peg <dig> transcripts to peg11as transcripts was unique in paternal heterozygous animals. micrornas are a central component of rna interference mechanisms. in the mouse, two antisense microrna have been identified for the orthologous rtl <dig> locus <cit> . rna interference mechanisms have been shown both to repress transcription by inducing heterochromatin formation <cit> and to cause post-transcriptional silencing through nuclear retention or targeted degradation <cit> . micrornas may be produced from post-transcriptional processing of peg11as rna and be involved in normal regulation of the locus and in generating overdominance <cit> . expression of peg11as may normally cause repression of the paternal peg <dig> locus since very little peg <dig> mrna was detectable in the muscles of normal animals. in the animals with a paternally inherited callipyge allele, , the normal repression of the peg <dig> locus has been disrupted by the mutation in a putative long range control element <cit> . peg <dig> transcripts only accumulate in significant excess of peg11as in the paternal heterozygous animals, whereas in the clpgmat/clpgpat animals the peg11as transcripts remain in excess and may prevent the accumulation of the threshold level of peg <dig> mrna required to produce a muscle hypertrophy phenotype. although the expression of peg11as was not affected by genotype in quantitative pcr, the northern blots and transcript mapping indicate there are multiple transcripts that are likely to undergo different intron splicing. further analysis of peg11as expression will be necessary to determine its role in the peg <dig> locus regulation. CONCLUSIONS the effect of the callipyge mutation has been to increase transcript abundance of four genes, dlk <dig> gtl <dig> peg <dig> and meg <dig> within the imprinted cluster in skeletal muscles that become hypertrophied. the increase in transcript abundance was consistent with each gene's parental allele-specific expression. the dlk <dig> and peg <dig> genes were both expressed at their highest levels in paternal heterozygous animals and exhibited polar overdominant gene expression patterns. therefore, both genes are candidates for causing muscle hypertrophy. dlk <dig> expression was only elevated in muscles that undergo hypertrophy, so its muscle-specific increase was consistent with the callipyge phenotype. peg <dig> was 12-fold more abundant in hypertrophied muscle than non-hypertrophied muscle and only paternal heterozygous animals had peg <dig> transcript levels in excess of peg11as transcript levels. the unique relationship of peg <dig> and peg11as in paternal heterozygous animals suggests that an rna interference mechanism may have a role in regulating the peg <dig> locus and polar overdominance in callipyge sheep.",

proteins when only sequence information is available. several approaches have been proposed for this task which are \"local\" in the sense that they assign a protein to a cluster based only on the distances between that protein and the other proteins in the set. in fact, the majority of these methods are based on thresholding a sequence similarity measure and considering two protein sequences potentially homologous if their similarity is above the threshold <cit> . however, by considering scop superfamilies as gold standard collections of homologous proteins and analysing the distribution of sequence distances within and between superfamilies, it was shown that there does not exist a single threshold on blast e-values that can be used to cluster homologues correctly <cit> . as a consequence, while the existing methods yield adequate results for close homologues, they are likely to fail in identifying distant evolutionary relationships. a possible way to improve these results is to use \"global\" methods, which cluster a set of proteins taking into account all the distances between every pair of proteins in the set. paccanaro et al <cit> introduced a global method based on spectral clustering and showed that it has better performance than commonly used local methods and tribemcl <cit> . other authors have also used spectral clustering successfully in various biological contexts <cit> . the development of scps was motivated by the fact that currently available implementations of spectral clustering methods mostly consist of a few loosely coupled matlab scripts that assume a fair amount of familiarity with matlab programming and hence they are inaccessible for large parts of the research community. moreover, the mathematical formulation of the algorithm is rather involved and it is not trivial to implement all the details properly in an ex-novo implementation. scps provides an implementation of the spectral clustering algorithm <cit> via a simple, clean and user-friendly graphical user interface that requires no background knowledge in programming or in the details of spectral clustering algorithms. scps is also able to perform connected component analysis and hierarchical clustering, and it incorporates tribemcl, thus providing the user with an integrated environment where one can experiment with different clustering techniques. scps is extremely efficient and its speed scales well with the size of the dataset, allowing for the clustering of protein sets constituted by thousands of proteins in a few minutes. moreover, scps is able to calculate different cluster quality scores, it interfaces with external tools such as blast <cit> and cytoscape <cit> , and it can produce publication-quality graphical representations of the clusters obtained, thus constituting a comprehensive tool for practical research. for more advanced use-cases , we also included a sophisticated command line interface. scps was written in c++ and is distributed as an open-source package. precompiled executables are available for the three major operating systems at http://www.paccanarolab.org/software/scps. in the rest of this paper, we outline the general framework of our spectral clustering algorithm and then demonstrate its practical usage and usefulness via a number of benchmarks ranging from a few superfamilies to the entire scop database and the genome of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. implementation spectral clustering in scps the goal of scps is to infer homology relations between protein sequences based on pairwise sequence information only. the input dataset thus consists of either a set of protein sequences or a list of pairwise similarity scores between some protein domains. the output is a partition of the sequences such that each sequence is assigned to one and only one of the partitions in a way that the partitions represent groups of homologs. a typical scps workflow starts with either a fasta file containing sequences for the protein domains of interest, or a list of blast e-values for all pairs of proteins where significant sequence similarity was reported by blast. besides spectral clustering <cit> , scps currently supports connected component analysis, hierarchical clustering and tribemcl <cit> , and more algorithms will be added in the near future. the spectral clustering approach reformulates the problem of protein homology detection into that of finding an optimal partition of a weighted undirected graph g. each vertex of the graph corresponds to a protein sequence. vertices are connected by undirected, weighted edges, each edge denoting a similarity relation between the two proteins it connects. the weight of the edge is related to the probability of evolutionary relatedness. edges with large weight are more likely to appear between domains of the same superfamily, hence the problem of partitioning the graph into subsets of vertices with mostly heavy-weight edges is an equivalent formulation of the original protein sequence classification problem. spectral clustering solves the problem of finding the optimal partition by examining random walks on the similarity graph <cit> . our approach is based on the spectral clustering algorithm of <cit> . the general workflow is depicted on figure <dig> the basic steps of the algorithm are as follows: <dig> if the input file is a fasta sequence file, we conduct an all-against-all matching using blast and store the e-values. <dig> given the pairwise blast e-values obtained either from the previous step or directly from the input file, we build an affinity matrix based on a non-linear transformation from e-values to similarity scores. the matrix element in row i and column j contains the e-value corresponding to protein j when protein i was used as a query sequence. <dig> since the blast e-value corresponding to a query protein i matching protein j in the database is not necessarily equal to the case when the query protein j matches protein i in the same database, the affinity matrix has to be symmetrized. to obtain a symmetric matrix, we take the higher similarity score in case of ambiguity. let sij denote the symmetrized similarity score between protein i and protein j. the sij values together constitute the symmetrized affinity matrix s, whose main diagonal contains only ones. <dig> we conduct a preliminary connected component analysis on the graph represented by the affinity matrix s to identify small connected components containing less than five sequences. it is unlikely that these components should be subdivided further, therefore we remove the rows and columns corresponding to these sequences from s, obtaining a reduced matrix s'. <dig> we construct a symmetric matrix l = d-1/2s'd-1/ <dig> where d is a diagonal matrix formed of the vertex degrees (), and find the eigenvectors corresponding to the k largest eigenvalues of l. let us denote these eigenvectors by u <dig> u <dig> ..., uk, respectively. <dig> we build a matrix u s.t. the kth column of u is uk and normalize the rows of the matrix such that each row in u has unit length. <dig> treating the rows of u as points in the k-dimensional euclidean space ℝk, we conduct a k-means clustering of these points into k clusters. the initial centroid positions are chosen from the data points themselves, placed as orthogonally to each other as possible. <dig> we assign node i in the original graph to cluster j if and only if row i of y was assigned to cluster k in the previous step. small connected components obtained in step <dig> are also merged back into the dataset in this final stage. an important advantage of this method is that the number of clusters can be selected automatically by evaluating the eigenvalues of s'. in our implementation, k is set to the smallest integer k such that λk/λk+ <dig> > ε. ε is adjustable and it is chosen to be <dig> by default. the main role of ε is to control the granularity of the clustering obtained: larger ε values tend to produce more fine-grained clusters, while a smaller ε yields only a few large clusters. we found that the default choice works well in a wide variety of biological problems . another way to control the granularity of the clustering is to override k manually either before the clustering process or after the eigenvalue calculation. both methods are facilitated by the scps user interface. the clustering results are presented in a separate window where the user can examine and draw the clusters one by one, calculate various quality measures , visualize the heatmap of the rearranged similarity matrix or export the results in plain text or xgmml format. xgmml files can later be loaded into cytoscape to facilitate further visualisation and analysis. the heatmap of the rearranged similarity matrix can also be exported in publication quality to a png file. scps can also retrieve human-readable protein descriptions based on gi numbers from ncbi to aid the interpretation of the results. clusters are drawn using the fruchterman-reingold layout algorithm <cit> , a force-directed iterative layout algorithm where nodes are considered as tiny particles that repel each other, while edges represent springs that pull the endpoints of the edge closer. the strength of the attraction force is proportional to the similarity score used in our analyses, hence the obtained layout will tend to place highly similar pairs of proteins close to each other. figure <dig> shows an example of a cluster drawing produced by scps. finally, scps includes a command line interface which runs the clustering without user intervention and writes the results to the standard output or to a specific output file. this enables the integration of scps in batch processing pipelines. implementation details scps uses the arpack library <cit> for eigenvector calculations. the arpack library implements the implicitly restarted arnoldi method for eigenvector calculations, which is an iterative process that is able to calculate all the eigenvectors and eigenvalues or only the top k ones. when one can provide a reasonable upper estimate on the number of clusters, the arnoldi method is much more efficient than standard methods that solve the eigenvector equation directly. on the other hand, the convergence of iterative methods is affected negatively in the presence of eigenvalues with multiplicity greater than one. the multiplicity of the top eigenvalue of the affinity matrix s is equal to the number of connected components in the input graph. therefore, we first eliminate small connected components of size less than five sequences from the original graph and then connect the remaining components by a small amount of random edges with weight less than <dig> . this decreases the multiplicity of the top eigenvalue to one and thus improve the stability of the eigenvector calculation process without affecting the final result. the number of clusters can be selected using one of the following methods in our implementation: • automatic. this method uses the eigengaps to select the appropriate number of clusters. k is set to the smallest integer k such that λk/λk+ <dig> > ε. ε is adjustable and it is chosen to be <dig> by default. • bounded from above. this method is similar to the automatic selection, but it considers at most a given number of clusters. it takes advantage of the fact that the complete eigenspectrum is not needed in this case when using the spectral clustering, saving time and resources during the computation. if the maximum number of clusters is kmax, scps will compute only the top kmax eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors. • exactly. the user can select the desired number of clusters either before the analysis or after the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigengaps. transforming blast e-values to similarities a crucial step in the application of spectral clustering methods in the context of protein sequences is the transformation from blast e-values to similarities. scps uses an approach based on the statistical analysis of e-values within and between scop superfamilies. a randomly selected set of <dig> e-values chosen from sequences within the same superfamily and <dig> e-values chosen from sequences in different superfamilies were used to train a logistic regression model that discriminates between intra-superfamily and inter-superfamily e-values. the posterior probability returned by the model on any e-value is then interpreted as the probability of evolutionary relatedness. in case of asymmetric e-values for a pair of proteins, the lower e-value is used. the proteins used for training the logistic regression model were not used later in performance assessments of the algorithm. quality measures this section describes the various quality measures we implemented in scps. in the following subsections, we will use the following notations: • sij is the similarity value labelling the edge between vertex i and j in a graph g. sij = sji since we always symmetrize the initial similarity values. • δij is <dig> if vertices i and j are within the same cluster, zero otherwise. we will also need the following definitions: definition <dig> the weight of vertex i is the sum of the weight of all its adjacent edges:di = Σjsij. definition <dig> the weight of cluster i is the sum of the weight of all the edges that lie fully within cluster i . mass fraction the mass fraction <cit> is an internal quality measure of a clustering on a given graph g. intuitively, a clustering is good if the total weight of its clusters is comparable to the total weight of the whole network; in other words, most of the heavy-weight edges are within clusters. the mass fraction simply denotes the fraction of edge weights that is concentrated inside the clusters. definition <dig> the mass fraction of a clustering defined by dij is given as follows: a disadvantage of this measure is that it attains its maximum when all the vertices are in the same cluster, hence the mass fraction alone cannot be used to decide whether a given clustering is better than another. modularity modularity <cit> is another internal quality measure of a clustering on a given graph g. the idea is that it is not enough for a clustering to be good when it contains much of the edge weights within the clusters; the clustering is good when it contains more weight within the clusters than what we would expect if we rearranged the edges of the graph randomly while keeping the vertex weights constant. therefore, the difference between the actual cluster weight and the expected cluster weight after such rearrangement is a good indicator of the general quality of the clustering. this measure also avoids the problem with trivial clusterings: a cluster containing all the vertices will contain exactly the same weight before and after rewiring as all the edges will stay within the same cluster, so the modularity score will be zero. similarly, a clustering where each vertex is in its own cluster will also yield zero modularity as there are no intra-cluster edges at all. formally, the modularity score of a clustering is the normalized difference between the actual weight of the clusters and the expected cluster weight after a random rewiring that preserves the vertex weights. it can be shown that the expected weight of the edge between vertex i and j after rewiring is , where m is the sum of all edge weights in the graph <cit> . the modularity formula then follows easily: definition <dig> let δij be <dig> if vertices i and j are in the same cluster and zero otherwise. the modularity of the partition defined by δ is then as follows: positive modularity then means that there is more weight concentrated within the clusters than what we would expect from a completely random graph with the same vertex weight distribution. heatmap of the rearranged similarity matrix this quality measure is not a single numeric value, but it provides a visual cue to the goodness of a clustering result. the basic idea is that the initial similarity matrix can be plotted as a greyscale heatmap where each pixel corresponds to a single cell of the matrix and the intensity of the pixel is proportional to the weight that the corresponding cell in the matrix represents. the rows and columns of the similarity matrix can be arranged in arbitrary order, but by arranging them in a way that rows and columns corresponding to the same cluster are next to each other, one can uncover a block-diagonal structure in the matrix if the clustering is good. RESULTS in this section, we present the results of a comparison of scps with other popular clustering methods on various datasets assembled from scop <dig> <cit> , astral- <dig> <cit> and string v <dig> <cit> . first, we will describe the datasets we used, then we give an overview of the methods we compared scps with and the quality measures we used to evaluate the performance of each method. after that, the benchmark results will be presented in detail. we conclude the section with a short discussion on the scalability of scps. data datasets 1- <dig> and the scop≥ <dig> dataset in our benchmarks were taken from scop <dig> <cit> . sequence data for these datasets were gathered from astral- <dig> <cit> . sequence data for the yeast genome benchmark were downloaded from string v <dig> <cit> and the corresponding gene ontology annotations were assembled from the saccharomyces genome database <cit> . datasets 1- <dig> are similar to the ones used in <cit> , but they were updated to reflect the changes in superfamily classification since the publication of the original paper. dataset <dig> was created explicitly for this study. the list of scop superfamilies used in each of the four datasets are listed in table <dig> the size of the dataset denotes the number of sequences in astral- <dig> corresponding to domains of the superfamily. the scop≥ <dig> dataset was constructed from scop <dig> and astral- <dig> as follows: a database containing all sequences in astral- <dig> was used to conduct an all-against-all search using blast. for each sequence in astral- <dig> the corresponding superfamily was looked up from scop and a gold standard clustering was created using all the superfamilies that contained at least five sequences. superfamilies containing less than five domains with associated sequence information were excluded from the benchmark, as we were interested in the performance of the methods in case of non-trivial superfamilies. the final dataset contained <dig> superfamilies. datasets 1- <dig> are distributed with the downloadable scps package. the scop≥ <dig> and the yeast genome dataset was excluded as it would have disproportionately increased the size of the package, but it is available from the authors upon request. alternative clustering approaches hierarchical clustering hierarchical clustering is a family of clustering methods that start with individual data points and then build a tree by iteratively merging the closest points until only one is left <cit> . the final cluster assignment is then determined by cutting the branches of the tree at a specific level. the various hierarchical clustering methods usually differ only in the way they define the distance between two sets of data points and the way they choose the optimal level to cut the branches of the tree in the end. the best results in our datasets were obtained by using the average distance metric, in which the distance between two sets of data points is given by the average distance between all possible point pairs such that one point is chosen from one of the sets and the other one is from the other set. the tree was cut at the level where the average distance metric was above 10- <dig> similarly to <cit> . pairs of proteins where blast did not return an e-value were considered to have an e-value of <dig> which is the default blast e-value threshold. connected component analysis connected component analysis is a method that has been widely used in computer vision <cit> and was initially applied to sequence clustering in generage <cit> and proclust <cit> . the method starts with a fully connected graph where the edges are labeled by the e-values or some other suitable distance metric. the algorithm proceeds by removing edges labelled by a distance larger than a given threshold, then collecting groups of vertices that still remained connected. these groups are then considered as the final result of the algorithm. the e-value threshold used in our benchmarks was 10- <dig> similarly to generage <cit> . tribemcl tribemcl <cit> , a variant of the markov clustering algorithm , models the random walk of a particle on a similarity graph, similarly to spectral clustering. a detailed comparison is given in <cit> , here we only note that the fundamental difference between mcl and spectral clustering is the way the random walk is propagated along the edges of the network. while our spectral clustering algorithm models the random walk exactly and analyses perturbations to the stationary distribution of the random walk, mcl modifies the random walk to promote the emergence of clusters. this approximation allows mcl to converge faster, but it can potentially lead to many small clusters. another, less significant difference is the way tribemcl symmetrizes the input matrix of e-values: while scps takes the smaller e-value in face of ambiguity and then transforms it to a similarity value, tribemcl transforms both e-values to similarities first by taking the negative base <dig> logarithm and then symmetrizes the pair by taking the average. a more detailed comparison of the two algorithms is to be found in <cit> . for the tribemcl benchmarks on datasets 1- <dig> we tuned the inflation parameter of the algorithm by trying all possible values with a step size of <dig> in the range , as suggested by the documentation of the algorithm. the final inflation parameter was chosen in a way that resulted in the highest f-score. for the scop≥ <dig> dataset, the inflation parameter was chosen as the average of the inflation parameters that were the best for datasets 1- <dig> comparing clusterings with a gold standard we used the combined f-score to compare a clustering result with the gold standard scop superfamily classification. let n denote the total number of proteins in the dataset, ni* the number of proteins in the ith superfamily, n*j the number of proteins in the jth calculated cluster and nij the number of proteins that are in superfamily i and cluster j at the same time. definition <dig> the precision of cluster j with respect to superfamily i is the fraction of proteins in cluster j that are also in superfamily i: pij = nij /n*j definition <dig> the recall of cluster j with respect to superfamily i is the fraction of proteins in superfamily i that are also in cluster j: rij = nij/ni* now we can define the combined f-score, which combines precision and recall with equal weights. definition <dig> the combined f-score is defined as follows: the combined f-score attains its maximum at <dig> if the two clusterings are identical. benchmarks on scop the validity of the spectral clustering approach was tested on several datasets assembled from the scop database, version <dig> <cit> . sequences were extracted from astral- <dig> <cit> , i.e. the sequence identity between any two sequences was at most 95%. datasets 1- <dig> contained sequences from 5- <dig> protein superfamilies that were hand-chosen to resemble the datasets originally used in <cit> . dataset <dig> was conceived specifically for this study. finally, the scop≥ <dig> dataset contains all the scop superfamilies containing at least five sequences. the datasets were described in detail earlier in the data subsection. the results of the spectral clustering algorithm running in fully automatic mode with default parameters were compared to the results obtained from hierarchical clustering <cit> , connected component analysis <cit> and tribemcl <cit> . the obtained partitions were compared with the gold standard scop superfamilies using the f-score which combines precision and recall with equal weight. the results are presented on table <dig> showing that spectral clustering clearly outperforms all the other methods at the superfamily level. the best f-score for each dataset is highlighted in bold. clustering the genome of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae to further test the scalability of our method and to assess its performance on the genome of a model organism with multi-domain proteins, we collected <dig> sequences of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae from string v <dig> <cit> and performed an all-against-all blast search on them with the default blast parameters. the blast hits were processed with spectral clustering, tribemcl, connected component analysis and hierarchical clustering and clusters of size less than three were excluded from further assessment. the parameters for the various algorithms were the same as in the scop≥ <dig> benchmark. owing to the lack of a hand-curated gold standard family classification for s. cerevisiae and the fact that proteins in a protein family tend to be functionally and structurally related, the quality of the clusters obtained were assessed by comparing them to gene ontology molecular function annotations <cit> . electronic annotations and annotations based on non-traceable author statements were ignored. for the remaining annotations and for each detected cluster of each method, multiple hypergeometric tests were performed to assess the statistical significance of the occurrence of go molecular function terms within the cluster at a significance level of <dig> . correction for multiple hypothesis testing was performed by controlling the false discovery rate using the benjamini-hochberg method <cit> . we treated a cluster as significant if at least one of the go terms were overrepresented within the cluster and then calculated the total number of significant clusters divided by the total number of clusters containing at least three proteins, as well as the total size of significant clusters divided by the total size of clusters containing at least three proteins. these ratios along with the exact numbers are reported in table <dig> although hierarchical clustering and connected component analysis achieve the highest significant cluster ratio when taking into account the cluster counts only, they both generate a high number of singletons and clusters of size two, therefore the significant clusters cover only a small fraction of the whole similarity graph . the difference becomes clear when the same ratios are calculated using the cluster sizes instead of the cluster counts: spectral clustering dominates with <dig> sequences in <dig> significant clusters covering <dig> % of the <dig> sequences that are in clusters of at least size three, while tribemcl comes second with <dig> sequences in <dig> clusters covering <dig> % of the <dig> sequences in clusters of size ≥ <dig> one may argue that this difference can be attributed to the fact that spectral clustering tends to produce fewer and thus larger clusters than mcl, but the same difference between spectral clustering and tribemcl can also be seen in the unweighted case . similar results were obtained when we used the mips funcat annotations <cit> instead of the gene ontology . these results illustrate that spectral clustering is a viable alternative to other popular methods even on a genome-wide scale. scalability considerations the spectral clustering method has two potential bottlenecks. one of them is the k-means clustering step where no exact result is known about the number of steps the algorithm takes in the worst case. however, it was shown recently that the k-means clustering procedure terminates in a polynomial number of steps with high probability in high-dimensional spaces when the data points are drawn from independent multivariate normal distributions <cit> . it was also proven that given a clustered structure in the original input dataset, data points of the same cluster will be aligned roughly along orthogonal directions in our k-means step. the normalisation step then ensures that these points will be situated close to each other <cit> , thus they can be approximated well with multivariate normal distributions. therefore, the data points we are likely to encounter in the k-means step satisfy the conditions of polynomial time complexity. the other potential bottleneck of the algorithm is the calculation of the eigenvectors. typically, the number of steps required to calculate the top k eigenvectors scales linearly with the number of non-zero elements in the input matrix when using the implicitly restarted arnoldi method <cit> . since scps uses this method when a maximum cluster count is specified, the algorithm is expected to terminate in polynomial time for real sequence similarity datasets, enabling us to analyse large datasets comprising of thousands of protein sequences. in our experiments, the scop≥ <dig> dataset was processed in <dig> minutes using a single core of a quad-core intel xeon x <dig> desktop machine running at <dig> ghz, using the top <dig> eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the similarity matrix. this does not include the cpu time required to run the all-against-all blast query on scop, which took nearly four hours. CONCLUSIONS in this paper, we presented scps, an efficient, user-friendly, scalable and platform-independent improved implementation of a spectral clustering method <cit> , which can identify protein superfamilies in datasets containing thousands of proteins within a few minutes. the software along with its source code is available to non-commercial users free of charge. we would like to encourage users and developers to provide feedback, suggest new features or contribute code. future work will focus on the improvement of the similarity measure used by the algorithm and a parallelized implementation of the method to exploit the power of multiple cpu cores. availability and requirements project name: scps project home page: http://www.paccanarolab.org/software/scps operating systems: windows, mac os x, linux programming language: c++ license: gnu general public license v3 restrictions to use by non-academics: none authors' contributions tn designed and implemented the scps graphical and command line interfaces, contributed robustness, stability and scalability improvements to the original algorithm and performed benchmarks. rs provided important biological insights and ideas to the algorithm and the datasets and extensively tested the software. ap conceived and implemented the first version of the algorithm, contributed valuable ideas to the present implementation and tested the algorithm. tn, rs and ap contributed to the writing of the paper. all the authors have read and approved the final manuscript.",

over recent years. traditionally, the level of transcribed mrna has been analyzed using methods such as northern blots, quantitative rt-pcr, differential display <cit> , representational difference analysis <cit> , total gene expression analysis <cit> and suppressive subtractive hybridization <cit> . all these methods, although fruitful and still in use, have a limited scope with regard to the number of genes that can be analyzed simultaneously. because of this limitation, new methods have been developed, including serial analysis of gene expression <cit> , massive parallel signature sequencing <cit> , cdna and oligo microarray chip technologies <cit> and affymetrix genechips <cit> . sage is based on the high-throughput sequencing of concatemers of short sequence tags that originate from a known position within a transcript and therefore theoretically contain sufficient information to identify a transcript <cit> . in contrast to microarrays, sage estimates the abundances of thousands of transcripts without prior knowledge of the transcripts being expressed. the proportion of the tag within the total number of tags in the library gives a direct estimate of the abundance of the transcript within a biological sample. the advantage of the sage technique is that it performs a random sampling from the pool of all expressed transcripts allowing the discovery of new transcripts. the proportional nature of the data enables easy exchange among researchers thus allowing the creation of large public sage data sets for numerous human tissues, both normal and diseased <cit> . disadvantages of sage are that the technique is expensive, labor-intensive and prone to sequencing errors. moreover, the annotation of the short <dig> bp sequence tags may identify more than one transcript. this can be overcome by using longsage libraries that contain <dig> bp tags which can be more reliably mapped to unigene clusters or the complete genome sequence <cit> . however, sage is not suitable for high-throughput analyses of multiple samples. in contrast to sage, dna microarrays are used to measure relative expression levels between samples of thousands of known transcripts. currently, three array variants are being used i.e. spotted cdna microarrays, spotted oligonucleotide microarrays and synthesized oligonucleotide microarrays . the advantages of affymetrix genechips are that they are highly sensitive enabling the detection of mrnas present at levels as low as <dig> transcript in <dig> <cit> when the probe labeling step is not considered <cit> . they are suitable for high-throughput analyses of multiple samples, and data can easily be shared and used for comparisons with other researchers using the same chips. disadvantages of affymetrix genechips are that they are only commercially available, are costly and require expensive specialized equipment and are inflexible in design . furthermore, genechips only measure the expression of genes represented on the chip in contrast to sage, in which the expression profile of the complete transcriptome can be mapped. at present, sage, oligo microarrays, cdna microarrays and affymetrix genechips are the most widely used techniques for determining gene expression levels and gene expression ratios in different disease states and in cells under different physiological conditions or environmental stimuli. often these different gene-expression profiling platforms are being used in parallel and data generated with the different techniques need to be compared, and possibly interchanged, within and between laboratories. due to the overall difference in platform design, transcript level estimation, and gene annotation, direct comparisons are difficult and only a few attempts have been made to compare these different platforms . to determine the overall correspondence between expression levels or expression ratios of two different platforms several methods have been used in literature . these include the parametric or non-parametric correlation coefficients between platforms, and contingency tables with varying numbers of classes for each platform. for the latter a correspondence measure can be calculated as the percentage of transcripts falling in the cells on the diagonal . an extreme form of the contingency table has only <dig> classes per platform and therefore only <dig> cells. this form of concordance estimation is dubbed \"up/down classification\" . none of these correspondence measures was deemed satisfactory because they either treat very different ratios as similar . this, in our view, makes the up/down classification very unreliable as an agreement measure. the use of contingency tables with more classes is already a better approach, but still some genes will be considered to be \"in disagreement\" while they have nearly corresponding expression ratios . the pearson correlation coefficient is a measure for the fraction of variation in y that is explained by the variation in x, and as such, only gives a measure for the tendency of the plotted points to increase simultaneously . because of the large number of points, a slight linear regression of y on x will give a highly significant correlation coefficient. however, when studying the correspondence between gene expression platforms, the expected linear relation has a slope of <dig> when the results of both platforms are in complete correspondence , and the deviation of the observed scatter plot from this expected relation should be tested. neither the linear pearson, nor the spearman rank correlation coefficient is suited for such a test. although the fit of the point cloud to the y = x relation can be easily calculated, the resulting statistic would still only provide a goodness of fit measure for the whole data set without giving any information on the correspondence per gene. to remedy these pitfalls we will introduce a correspondence measure based on the difference between the log values in the two platforms for each individual transcript. apart from serving as the basis for a measure for overall platform concordance, this method also provides the user with an agreement measure for each individual transcript which is of more interest than the overall correlation. in the current study we have determined the similarity between sage- and affymetrix genechips-generated gene expression profiles of two independent rna samples. one rna sample is isolated from a wilms' tumor; the other is the stratagene universal reference rna. these expression data were then used to evaluate the annotation problems when comparing different gene profiling platforms and the methods that can be used to compare two different platforms with respect to individual gene expression measurements and with respect to between-sample gene expression ratios. finally, it is demonstrated that the between-ratio difference can be applied to select those transcripts that display similar expression changes in both platforms. RESULTS sage data analysis in order to compare sage with other gene expression profiling techniques we created a sage library with <dig> tags from a wilms' tumor sample. sage data for the stratagene universal reference rna were obtained from the ncbi website. all tag counts are after removal of duplicate dimers and linker sequences. within the sage libraries we could identify <dig> and <dig> unique sage <dig> bp tags, for the wilms tumor sample and the stratagene sample, respectively. tags can be divided into tags with low abundance , intermediate abundance , and high abundance . in each of the libraries, these categories contained on average 84%, 15% and 1% of the total number of unique tags . in addition, we created a longsage library of the wilms tumor sample for annotation purposes and not for the comparison with affymetrix genechips. this library could be used as a technical replicate of the 'short' sage library. comparison of the sage and longsage libraries showed a pearson correlation coefficient of <dig> and using z-test statistics <cit> the two libraries only differed significantly from each other in 3% or <dig> % of the tags . the observed differences in the longsage library versus the normal sage library might be due to treatment with different linkers, tagging enzyme and elimination of a blunt-end ligation. the pattern of variation in figure 2a closely resembles the variation predicted by the binomial distribution <cit> of sage tag counts with only the 3% significantly different tag counts , falling outside the range of critical values. overall sage and longsage give identical results. microarray analyses microarray experiments were performed using wilms' tumor rna and the stratagene reference rna. results of biological replicas of each sample, with independent crna synthesis and hybridizations, showed a good reproducibility and <dig> ;both p < <dig> ) using intensity values for all probe sets with a \"present\" signal . this indicates that two identical rna samples perform very similar within the pre-processing and final hybridization reactions. although, in contrast to sage, the intensity signals on the array do not represent the actual abundance of mrna molecules, we classified the affymetrix data to get an impression of the signal distribution. these distributions are similar to those of the sage data. the majority of the probe sets showed low signal intensity. annotation problems in the comparison of data obtained by sage and affymetrix genechips only reliably annotated tags can be included . annotation of sage tags to genes and their corresponding unigene cluster numbers revealed that on average 30% of all tags could be reliably annotated based on the sage genie principles <cit> . annotation improves to an average of 70% for tags that have an intermediate to abundant expression level. the remainder of the tags could not reliably be associated with a gene or unigene cluster because they were not available through the sage genie site, annotated to unclustered ests, or their reliability was below 67% . additionally, we performed longsage for the wilms' tumor sample, which allows the identification of <dig> bp tags instead of <dig> bp tags. theoretically, over <dig> % of the <dig> bp tags are expected to occur only once in the human genome. however, analyses based on actual sequences have demonstrated that only 75% of the <dig> bp tags occur only once in the human genome, with the remaining tags matching duplicated genes or repeated sequences <cit> . complete annotation of longsage tags using sage genie data and principles revealed that 28% of all tags could be assigned a reliable unigene cluster. similar to sage, the annotation improves to approximately 70% for tags that have an intermediate to abundant expression level. the affymetrix hg-u133a genechips contained probe sets for <dig> unigene clusters that could be identified, whereas eight percent of the probe sets could not be linked to a unigene cluster because these sequences are withdrawn or because these sequences are currently under revision. figure <dig> gives a schematic representation of the matching of sage and affymetrix hg-u133a genechips data with additional information about the number of unigene clusters within each platform, number of unambiguous unigene clusters in each comparison and the unigene clusters included in the final comparison. this final comparison contains 13% of the sage unigene clusters and 8% of the affymetrix unigene clusters. these data represent 32% of the unambiguous unigene clusters. because of the above-mentioned problems and restrictions, only <dig> tags and probe sets were uniquely matched to the same unigene clusters and were 'present' in both tissue samples and platforms. this relatively low number underscores the major problem in \"how to merge different expression platforms\". however, in view of the following quantitative comparison of gene expression platforms it is important to note that a comparison of frequency distributions of all clusters and of the selected clusters showed that the final selection of <dig> unigene clusters does not represent a biased sample neither for the sage tag counts, nor for the affymetrix array intensities. this is illustrated in figure 2d in which the frequency distributions are given for affymetrix intensities and sage tag counts from the final data set of <dig> unigene clusters. the smoothed line, which represents the frequency distribution of all sage tag counts and all affymetrix intensity data , does not differ from the distribution of the subset included in the comparison of the two platforms. comparison of gene expression levels in the comparison of platforms, we first analyzed the similarity of gene expression levels between sage and affymetrix data in one tissue sample. both datasets were matched according to their unigene cluster numbers. figure 2c shows a scatter plot of sage and affymetrix gene expression values of the <dig> unigene clusters before exclusion of ambiguous matches . for multiple matches, the highest tag count or intensity value per cluster was plotted. in this scatter plot the black spots represent the final selection of <dig> unambiguous and filtered unigene clusters. note that high affymetrix expression levels are observed for low sage tag counts , but that no high tag counts are found for low affymetrix data . overall, the correlation between sage tag counts and affymetrix intensity levels of the <dig> matching unigene clusters seemed to be modest. this was confirmed by mapping the distribution of the top <dig> highly expressed genes in sage in the distribution of the affymetrix dataset, and vice versa . in both comparisons, only halve of the genes from the top <dig> of one platform have a rank in the top <dig> of the other platform, whereas approximately 10% are matched to genes with ranks of over <dig> in the other platform. this already shows that the correlation of expression levels between platforms is modest. comparison of between-sample expression ratios in most gene expression studies, alterations of expression levels are expressed in relation to the simultaneously determined expression level of a reference sample and conclusions are drawn based on these ratios. to this end, expression ratios were calculated between the reference rna and the wilms' tumor data for the sage tag counts as well as for affymetrix hg-u133a genechips spot intensities. in this comparison the final data set containing only the between-sample ratios for unambiguous transcripts was used , allowing effective comparison of the two platforms. to enable direct comparisons of ratio measurements using different gene expression platforms, the ratios of the affymetrix platform were scaled to those of the sage platform as described in figure <dig> . in addition, different approaches were used to describe the correlation of the resulting scaled gene expression ratios between platforms . for the comparison of gene expression ratios based on contingency tables we used two approaches, i.e. up/down classification and a contingency table diagonal based on intensity classes . these comparisons lead to an agreement of 63% and 76% between platforms, respectively. furthermore, the pearson correlation coefficient, calculated as a measure for the agreement between platforms, was <dig> . regression analysis shows a linear trend with a slope of <dig> for affymetrix versus sage, which according to the correlation coefficient differs significantly from a slope of <dig> however, this slope also deviates significantly from the slope value of <dig> which is expected when the platforms are identical . finally, we compared sage and affymetrix data using our proposed classification based on the difference between the two ratios per unigene cluster. when we accept a <dig> to 3-fold difference as indicative for agreement between the two platforms , this approach showed that the two platforms have an agreement of 78%. like others have demonstrated the overall agreement between platforms improves when only highly expressed transcripts are included . when only lowly expressed genes were included the concordance based on the contingency table diagonal and correlation coefficient steeply decreased whereas the other measures were both hardly affected. inclusion of only those tags that were significantly differentially expressed between the two samples markedly improved the up/down classification and correlation coefficient based measures. note that the concordance measure based on the between-ratio difference was least affected by these selections. this indicates that this new measure is robust and less dependent on filtering than the other overall measures. <dig> based on the binomial sampling error of sage tags, tags counts below <dig> and <dig> for the wt and stratagene sample, respectively, are not significantly different from tag count <dig> when a tag falls below these thresholds in both libraries it is included in the \"low expression\" group ; when a tag counts is above these thresholds in both libraries it is included in the \"high expression\" group . the thresholds were calculated as the 95% confidence interval of the tag proportion: ci95%) = n ± <dig> * with n = tag count; n = library size and p = n/n <dig> significant difference between the two sage libraries is defined as a significant p-value according to the z-test between two libraries <cit> . <dig> all observed correlation coefficients are significant at p < <dig> sources of differences in gene expression ratios in an attempt to explain the difference in gene expression between sage and affymetrix genechips we summarize different sources. variation due to \"noisy fold ratios\" generated from low-intensity transcripts is a widespread cause of error when computing statistics on ratios without accounting for the intensities from which the ratios were derived <cit> . within our data set we have shown that the final data set is an unbiased selection of the total data set . additionally, the mean intensity signals for both sage and affymetrix genechips appear to be randomly distributed over the ratio distribution . this indicates that the difference in expression ratios between platforms is not caused by low intensity values. in addition, it has been suggested that the gc-content of the transcripts could influence the correspondence between platforms <cit> . to test this hypothesis for the final data set we retrieved all transcript sequences and probe set sequences and calculated the gc-content for each transcript and the average gc-content of the corresponding probe sets. the gc-contents were divided into classes and the correlation between gc-content and the differences in expression ratios between platforms was tested. statistical analysis showed that ratio differences did not depend on the gc-content of the transcript . however, unigene clusters showing good agreement between platforms tend to depend on the high gc-content of the corresponding probe sets . this gc-analysis indicates that expression data from probe sets with a higher gccontent show a better agreement with their corresponding sage data and are more reliable. note in this respect that for a unigene cluster the gc content of a probe set is not necessarily the same as that of a transcript. discussion to answer the question whether gene expression data generated by sage and by affymetrix hg-u133a genechips can be used interchangeably, data from these two techniques were compared using two independent rna samples. analysis of intra-platform variation shows good correlation for both sage and affymetrix; this is also observed by others . the inter-platform comparison depends on reliable annotation of the sage tags for which we used the tag annotation from sage genie <cit> . a reliable association could be made only for 30% of all tags, which increases to 70% for intermediate and high abundant tags. this indicated that sage tag annotation requires improvement, especially for low abundant tags. based on literature findings, the use of longsage should refine annotation of sage tags <cit> . however, the current study showed an annotation profile similar to the above-mentioned percentages, indicating that longsage is still not sufficient for unique gene identification. similar disappointing improvements in annotation efficiency have been found in other studies <cit> . further comparison of sage and longsage requires a study that falls beyond the scope of this paper; such a study has recently been published <cit> . for the annotation in affymetrix genechips, accession numbers had to be converted to unigene clusters, which was hampered by the fact that 8% of the transcripts present on affymetrix hg-u133a genechips were no longer present in a unigene cluster. moreover, some probe sets might represent a different transcript than initially reported . a first impression about the agreement between sage and affymetrix hg-u133a genechips was obtained from the evaluation of the top <dig> of highly abundant transcripts in one rna sample in each platform. this comparison showed that approximately 50% of the top <dig> of highly expressed transcripts showed a corresponding expression within the top <dig> of highly expressed transcripts of the other platform. this is in line with the findings of ishii et al. <cit> who compared sage with affymetrix genechips containing approximately <dig> transcripts, and iacobuzio-donahue et al. <cit> who showed that only genes that display robust changes in gene expression were identified by both platforms. in our current study, approximately 80% of transcripts detected in the top <dig> of one platform were mapped within the top <dig> of the competing platform. a similar figure was presented by evans et al. <cit> who used the rg-u34a affymetrix genechips. recently, kim <cit> suggested that absolute expression analyses of sage and oligonucleotide microarray technology reliably detected medium-to-high abundant transcripts. for a more extensive comparison between the individual gene expression profiling platforms we used gene expression ratios between wilms' tumor and stratagene universal reference rna as determined by sage and affymetrix genechips. the use of ratios might have the disadvantage of losing information about individual expression values. however, it corrects for platform specific variations . by matching sage and affymetrix data, an unambiguous data set was generated. on average about 30% of the unambiguous genes were observed to be expressed by both sage and affymetrix genechips and could be included in the final comparison. although this comparison comprised only 13% of all sage unigene clusters and only 8% of the affymetrix unigene clusters, it was demonstrated that this selection was unbiased with respect to gene expression levels in each of the platforms. this allows the extrapolation of the conclusions to the whole platform. we looked for the correspondence in gene expression results between the two techniques using up/down classification , the contingency table diagonal and correlation coefficients . in addition, an approach was introduced in which differences between scaled ratios were calculated. the latter measure was introduced to circumvent pitfalls of up/down classification, contingency tables and correlation coefficient that were discussed in the background section. to this end, we introduced an approach in which the scaling of the ratio data enables the calculation of individual ratio differences between platforms. these ratio differences can then be used to determine to which extend and in which range two platforms differ in their expression ratio estimation. in this study we show that, as opposed to the other overall concordance measures, the between-ratio difference is hardly sensitive to filtering of noisy data. from the current analysis, we conclude that contingency tables and, preferably, calculation of ratio differences between two platforms should be used to compare gene expression profiles from different platforms. moreover, the between-ratio difference provides the user with a correspondence measure per individual gene that can be used to select those genes for which a predetermined correspondence level is reached. the approximately normal distribution of the between-ratio differences allows the calculation of a standardized difference value for each gene from which a p-value can be obtained. note that this p-value cannot be used to test whether the ratio difference equals zero. such a test requires a gene specific variance estimate in the denominator of the standardized difference and such a variance estimate cannot be obtained from the four non-replicated expression values that are used to calculate the ratio difference. however, the standardized difference and its p-value can be used as a measure for the position of a specific gene within the distribution of between-platform ratio differences and as such they can serve as a statistical threshold to determine which genes can be confidently interchanged between platforms. for instance, in the current study, the transcripts with a less than <dig> fold between-ratio difference have a chance of at least <dig> that they show similar gene expression on both platforms. some of the choices in the scaling procedure can be considered to be ad-hoc. however, given the current state of understanding of the causes for within and between platform variability it was deemed best to opt for a simple quadratic scaling equation to convert the distribution of ratios, which is asymmetric around <dig> to a common scale. when the knowledge on the physics, chemistry, and sampling statistics increases, better conversion functions will present themselves. the overall similarity between sage and affymetrix genechips is modest when expression ratios are compared. the correspondence improves to 90% when only highly expressed transcripts are included which means that noise is filtered out for both platforms. the differences between sage and affymetrix genechips were not caused by a biased selection of the final data set, differences in gc-content of the included transcripts or extreme ratios resulting from low gene expression values. the observed cross-platform differences, arise from intrinsic properties of the platforms themselves, differences in the principle of determining the expression levels, such as absolute versus quantitative mrna levels, and/or processing and analytical evaluation <cit> . these disparities of the two technical approaches are summarized in table <dig> and may all contribute to the modest overall correlation of sage and microarray data. we cannot conclude which of the platforms performs best. these results show, as also argued by tan and co-workers <cit> , that it is important to validate the results obtained with sage or affymetrix genechips with subsequent northern blots or quantitative pcr analysis <cit> . it was beyond the scope of our analysis to perform such a verification of expression data. anyway, such a validation is impractical for large numbers of genes. however, it seems that the divergence of the sage and affymetrix platforms in this study is for a large part due to the wide range of affymetrix gene expression values observed for transcripts with a low gene expression level in sage . a similar over-representation of high affymetrix expressions for low sage tag counts has been published by lu et al. <cit> . we currently showed that a sage and longsage library from the same rna sample showed nearly identical expression profiles . these findings confirm the results found within direct comparisons of sage libraries <cit> . in addition, the differences between sage and longsage can be fully explained by the binomial distribution of the sampling error in individual sage tag counts <cit> . therefore, it can be ruled out that many low sage tag counts originate from high abundant transcripts. this is also confirmed by sun et al. who demonstrate that 70% of the low-copy sage tags represent real low level transcripts <cit> . the affymetrix platform showed highly reproducible intensity values when applied twice to the same tissue sample. however, because of the variation between probe sets per unigene cluster <cit> it cannot beruled out that some affymetrix probe sets provide systematically biased intensity levels and expression ratios. it is a known problem that different probe sets belonging to the same transcript show variation in expression detection. several explanations have been given for this variation: probe sets may represent splice variants or may cross-hybridize to different members that belong to a highly similar gene family or transcripts with different poly-a sites; one probe set is more 5' located than the other and one probe set is better designed than the other <cit> . such a bias might explain the weak correspondence between the sage and affymetrix platform observed in this and other studies <cit> future studies should be aimed on improving the efficiency of sage tag annotation and avoidance of systematic bias in microarray techniques. only then, measurements of various technologies can be directly compared and transformed to a universal gene expression catalogue. sage has the advantage that a whole transcriptome is analyzed, but is limited to the analysis of a small number of samples. for screening of large sets of samples sage cannot be the favored choice and affymetrix genechips might be a good alternative. therefore, we think that the future lies in combining the data from sage with affymetrix genechips, custom cdna or oligo arrays. this gives the advantage of complete expression profiling using sage and high-throughput array screening of a larger panel of samples allowing rapid identification and for instance validation of clinical relevant genes involved in disease onset <cit> . finally, the proposed ratio difference between platforms using an universal reference sample can serve as a measure for interplatform correspondence per individual gene. CONCLUSIONS this paper evaluates several approaches for the comparison of different gene expression platforms, outlined using sage and affymetrix genechips. we demonstrate that for both sage and affymetrix genechips the intra-platform correlations are extremely good, but that the inter-platform agreement based on an unbiased selection of transcripts is modest. the agreement between platforms increases if only transcripts are included with high tag counts and high hybridisation intensities. it appears that the expression distributions are similar for each of the platforms, but that the correlation between platforms is modest due to intrinsic differences, like sensitivity, levels of noise, and gene annotation. finally, we introduce a novel, filtering-independent approach for data analysis based on the calculation of differences between expression ratios observed in sage and affymetrix genechips for each individual transcript. the statistical probability value that can be assigned to each individual betweenratio difference, allows the selection of individual transcripts that display similar regulation on both platforms.",

supply of proteins and lipids to generate a new plasma membrane and cell wall, and also the retrieval of excess membrane and recycling protein fractions by endocytotic processes which allow to maintain the membrane homeostasis in the cell <cit> . these highly dynamic events are orchestrated by several regulators of vesicle trafficking. among such factors, small gtpases of the rab family hold a central role in plant cells <cit> . rab gtpases are members of the ras small gtpase superfamily. rab gtpases cycle between an active gtp-bound and membrane associated form and an inactive, gdp-bound and predominantly cytosolic form, and are involved in membrane identity and specificity of vesicle targeting during vesicular trafficking, tethering and fusion <cit> . mechanistically, rab gtpases execute the kinetic proofreading of specific membrane surfaces via their reversible and gtp/gdp-dependent association/dissociation with membranes. in their active, gtp-bound form, rab gtpases are engaged into indirect interactions with coat components, motor proteins and snares. thus, rab gtpases emerged as multifaceted organizers in membrane trafficking processes in eukaryotic cells <cit> . the family of rab gtpases is particularly expanded in the arabidopsis genome with <dig> individual members classified in <dig> subfamilies . the most extensive subfamily in plants is raba encompassing <dig> of the total <dig> identified arabidopsis rabs <cit> . bearing in mind that by comparison to arabidopsis, mammalian and yeast raba homologues are much less represented <cit> , it is a question to understand the specific functions of individual rabas in plants. in this sense, it is important to survey plant raba diversity in terms of protein – protein interactions, specificity in intracellular localization patterns and possible differential developmental regulation at the tissue and organ level. previous studies have already illustrated the polar localization of some rabas in tip-growing cells, and its significance in tip-targeted cell wall deposition during elongation of pollen tubes and root hairs. the role of raba4b in polarized vesicular secretion of cell wall material is associated with the activity of effector protein pi-4kβ <dig> and can be affected by disruption of actin microfilaments <cit> . the role of plant rabas is not restricted to polar growth but is also associated with cytokinesis. in plants, the spatially and temporally-controlled post-mitotic partitioning of daughter cells through the cytokinetic deposition of cell plate is a process which is heavily dependent on membrane trafficking and endocytosis <cit> . starting with the preprophase definition of cell division plane, where the microtubule preprophase band marks a site of intensive clathrin-mediated membrane retrieval <cit> , the cytokinetic process of cell plate deposition is robustly associated with endocytotic-related deposition of wall material by cell plate targeting of vesicles identified through the rab <dig> arabidopsis orthologue ara <dig> <cit> . cytokinetic progression in arabidopsis also recruited raba <dig> raba <dig> and raba1c which colocalized with fm4- <dig> and partially with vacuolar h+-atpase subunit a <dig> in early endosomes and tgn <cit> . the relative contribution of endocytosis during cell plate formation is not completely understood, however, several observations suggest its essential role. cell surface materials and exogenously applied endocytic tracers were rapidly delivered to the forming cell plate <cit> , while the knolle syntaxin localized to endosomes previous to cell plate initiation and its localization in the plane of cell division involves endocytotic-related proteins <cit> . some of these proteins use a clathrin-mediated mechanism <cit> and their mutations confirm in vivo the role in cytokinesis <cit> . similarly, other rab-gtpases showed to be involved in endocytotic processes, such as rabf2a, rabf2b and rabf <dig> which are activated by vps9a <cit> and are localized in both early but preferentially in late/multivesicular endosomes <cit> . the role of rab gtpases is not restricted to endocytosis but has been also suggested in secretory trafficking . secretory roles may be also attributed to raba subfamily members since some of them were reported to localize in specific tgn compartments at the nexus of endocytosis and secretion <cit> . such tgn compartments were further corroborated by their aggregation following treatment with concanamycin a, an inhibitor of vacuolar h+−atpases <cit> and their insensitivity to wortmannin . moreover, raba2a and vha-a <dig> are mislocalized in the echidna mutant of arabidopsis thaliana, whereby endocytosis is unaffected but secretory trafficking is impaired <cit> . finally, the remarkable colocalizations of raba1b with vamp <dig> r- soluble n-ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor , but partial and unstable associations with tgn, golgi and endosome markers suggest a specific role in transport between tgn and the plasma membrane <cit> . our study reports the subcellular localization of raba1d and its role in vesicle trafficking. using light-sheet microscopy ensuring cell viability and stress-free root development during imaging, we found that raba1d is involved in two essential cellular processes, cell plate expansion during cytokinesis and oscillatory tip growth in root hairs, representing highly active vesicle trafficking events. RESULTS gfp-raba1d localizes to vesicle-like structures at trans-golgi network compartment in order to follow the localization patterns of raba1d, we engineered a gfp-raba1d expressed under cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter. specificity of gfp-raba1d localization was tested by transient expression of 35s::gfp:raba1d construct in allium porrum and nicotiana benthamiana and was confirmed in seedlings of arabidopsis thaliana stably transformed with the same construct . the expression of the fusion protein was verified by western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against gfp showing a single band at ca. 46 kda, corresponding to the molecular weight of the gfp-raba1d fusion .figure <dig> subcellular localization of gfp-tagged raba1d. subcellular localization of gfp-raba1d in cells of n. benthamiana. co-vizualization with er reporter er-dsred showed partial association of gfp-raba1d and cortical er tubules. gfp-raba1d colocalized with neither 2xfyve-dsred nor with mcherry-rabf2a , markers for late endosomes/multi-vesicular bodies. colocalization of gfp-raba1d with mcherry-vti <dig> representing a tgn marker . intensity correlation scatterplots of gfp-rab1ad and er-dsred , fyve-dsred , mcherry-rabf2a , and mcherry-vti <dig> . pearson’s coefficient was determined after costes automatic threshold. bars represent 3 μm in a-c and 5 μm in d-l. in both cases of transient transformation, gfp-raba1d localized to spot-like structures that were rapidly moving through the cytoplasm . moreover, the localization of gfp-raba1d was cross-compared with endomembrane markers of known specificity including endoplasmic reticulum , late endosomes and prevacuolar compartments and trans-golgi network /early endosomes . gfp-raba1d did not colocalize with er-dsred, however, motile spot-like structures containing gfp-raba1d appeared in close proximity to er tubules . the observation of the co-expression of fyve-dsred and mcherry-rabf2a with gfp-raba1d revealed no significant colocalization with the late endosomal markers . interestingly, an obvious colocalization was observed for gfp-raba1d and mcherry-vti <dig> a tgn marker. this colocalization showed good quantitative correlation; thereby, raba1d is localized at the tgn compartments . gfp-raba1d accumulates in bfa compartments and is upregulated by bfa treatment the above results indicated a localization of gfp-raba1d in tgn/early endosomes as expected for many other members of raba class. to better substantiate this localization pattern, arabidopsis seedlings stably expressing the gfp-raba1d fusion were co-stained with the membrane/endocytotic tracer fm4- <dig> <cit> , which depending on the immediacy of microscopic observation, localizes fully or partially with early endosomes such as those labeled with fluorescent protein-tagged vti <dig> . in this case, the gfp-raba1d vesicles colocalized with early fm4- <dig> compartments of the endocytotic pathway within 6–15 min after application of the dye . it was additionally confirmed by comparison with yfp-rabf2a late endosomal marker which showed partial colocalization with fm4- <dig> compartments only after 15 min . next, fm4- <dig> stained roots were treated with bfa, a fungal toxin that inhibits exocytosis and endocytotic recycling without affecting the first steps of endocytosis <cit> . importantly, after treatment with bfa, gfp-raba1d relocalized and accumulated in the core of bfa-compartments along with fm4- <dig> . these bfa-compartments are composed of tgn and plasma membrane-derived endocytotic vesicles in the core, surrounded by remnants of golgi stacks <cit> . the colocalization of gfp-raba1d and fm4- <dig> showed good quantitative correlation and it was increased after bfa-treatment . after bfa washout, the gfp-raba1d and fm4- <dig> compartments started to deliberate from bfa compartments within 5 min and progressively redistributed in the root cells. importantly, both gfp-raba1d and fm4- <dig> compartments remained colocalized during the release from the bfa compartments .figure <dig> gfp-raba1d accumulates in bfa compartments and is upregulated by bfa treatment. root cells of arabidopsis stably transformed with 35s::gfp:raba1d construct were analysed. gfp-raba1d colocalized with early endocytotic compartments labeled by fm4- <dig> . after bfa treatment, both gfp-raba1d and fm4- <dig> accumulated together in the core of bfa compartments . 2d-histogram intensity and correlation of gfp-rab1ad and fm4- <dig> early endocytotic compartments in root cells and after bfa

2-de gels and measured as increase of spot density . bars represent 4 μm in a-c and 5 μm in d-f. a proteomic analysis of bfa-treated arabidopsis roots, showed the quantitative upregulation of raba1d protein levels. this induction reached <dig> fold , however it slightly exceeded the significance level . raba1d identity was confirmed by a mowse score of <dig> and 25% sequence coverage with <dig> peptides matching . therefore, raba1d is involved in vesicle trafficking, its expression and localization in tgn/early endosomes is affected by bfa. gfp-raba1d accumulates in growing cell plates during cytokinesis in dividing root meristematic cells, gfp-raba1d specifically accumulated at the plane of cell plate deposition following similar centrifugal expansion observed for the microtubular phragmoplast. thus, at the onset of cytokinesis and during the early stages of cell plate formation, gfp-raba1d uniformly labeled the entire cell plate forming a thin continuous line when visualized cross-sectioned and fully co-localized with the fm4- <dig> marker . at more advanced stages, gfp-raba1d signal was restricted to the margins of the growing cell plate unmixing from fm4- <dig> labeling at the central region of the cell plate .figure <dig> localization of gfp-raba1d during the cell plate formation in cytokinetic cells. during cell plate initiation, gfp-raba1d localized in the mid plane of the dividing cell and completely colocalized with fm4- <dig> . in the early stage of growing cell plates, gfp-raba1d still appeared in the mid-plane of the cell . during cytokinesis, gfp-raba1d was accumulated mainly at the edges of growing cell plate . intensity profile of gfp-raba1d and fm4- <dig> signals during cell plate initiation and early stage of plate expansion , the two channels showed similar intensity and distribution; while in growing cell plate, gfp-raba1d showed more intensity at the edges of growing cell plate than fm4- <dig> . bars represent 2 μm. the cytokinesis-related localization patterns of gfp-raba1d were further followed by light-sheet microscopy which allows the observation of a physiological, unstressed root growth <cit> . the cells undergoing cytokinesis in the meristem showed several locations of gfp-raba1d accumulation . the accumulation patterns of gfp-raba1d coincided with areas of active vesicle fusion during cell plate formation and growth. in the initiating young cell plates, disc-like structures were observed, starting from diffuse expression probably during accumulation of vesicles and increased intensity during fusion of vesicles . during cell plate expansion, it formed a ring-like structure at the margins of the growing cell plates . the localization in the growing cell plate of gfp-raba1d during cytokinesis suggests a role in delivery of membranes/cargo for cell plate formation and membrane recycling at margin domains . the growth rate of cell plates labeled with gfp-rab1ad was comparable to that observed with gfp-map <dig> . however, significant differences were found between epidermis and pericycle cells expressing gfp-rab1ad .figure <dig> light-sheet live imaging of gfp-raba1d

and gravitropic response when transgenic plants were compared with non-transformed wild type plants . oscillatory accumulation of gfp-raba1d in tips of growing root hairs correlates with growth rate root hair growth is a robust example of tip-growth in plant cells, accompanied by polarized membrane trafficking . a previous study demonstrated the localization of raba1d in the apical dome of growing root hairs <cit> , however, without following this localization pattern in time. for this reason, we extended the microscopic documentation of gfp-raba1d in relation to root hair growth kinetics by means of light-sheet microscopy, which allowed following the distribution of gfp-raba1d for a considerable time encompassing the entire process of root hair growth, from emergence to cessation of elongation. as previously shown <cit> , gfp-raba1d labeling was predominantly observed in trichoblast outgrowths representing emerging root hairs and subsequently was largely restricted at the apical dome of vigorously growing root hairs . however, such accumulation of gfp-raba1d containing vesicles was not visible at the tips of non-growing mature root hairs. in bulges and growing root hairs, gfp-raba1d colocalized with the endocytotic marker fm4- <dig> in apical domains , but in mature root hairs both gfp-raba1d and fm4- <dig> were more or less equally distributed through the hair tube .figure <dig> light-sheet live imaging of gfp-raba1d accumulation during root hair oscillatory tip growth. maximum-intensity projections of two indicated time points . the actively growing root hairs showed a higher tip-accumulation than the slowly expanding or mature root hairs . the tip-accumulation of gfp-raba1d increased in steady state actively growing root hairs . the pixel line from b is plotted as a function of time . the kymograph exhibited an oscillating behavior between lower and higher intensity . fluorescence intensity measurements significantly correlated with the growth rates of the root hair . bars represent 100 μm in a and 10 μm in b. tip-accumulation of gfp-raba1d was observed in root hair bulges and growing root hairs being progressively reduced as root hair growth rates declined . the time-lapse imaging showed gfp-raba1d accumulation in bulge stage which was increased in a time dependent manner . as shown by fluorescence intensity profiles transverse to the root hair apical dome, gfp-raba1d signal intensity oscillated between lower and higher intensities which significantly correlated with the pause and growing phases of root hair growth, respectively . cross correlation coefficient calculations of root hair growth and gfp-raba1d intensity for particular periods of time, e.g. between 150–250 min, revealed r <dig> values of <dig> , reflecting a strong temporal correlation between apical raba1d accumulation and tip growth . the mode of oscillatory growth of root hairs was confirmed also in transgenic arabidopsis line expressing stress-induced mitogen activated protein kinase kinase tagged with yfp . simkk-yfp accumulated in nuclei and cytoplasm of root cells. observation using light sheet microscopy and determination of fluorescence intensity along transverse profile of growing root hairs showed the oscillatory pattern of root hair growth . this observation corroborated an assumption that raba1d participates in oscillatory cell expansion related to intensive and spatio-temporaly controlled vesicle trafficking in root hairs. movement of the vesicular compartments containing gfp-raba1d depends on the actin cytoskeleton the maximum speed of the raba1d-positive tgn vesicles was measured from kymographs of time-lapse image sequences from root hairs. this analysis revealed that gfp-raba1d vesicles moved with an average speed of about <dig> μm/s in root hairs .figure <dig> motility of gfp-raba1d vesicles in growing root hairs. kymograph showing the motility of the gfp-raba1d vesicles in

μm, : z = <dig> μm, : z = <dig> μm, : z = 50 μm) are depicted in . the dashed boxed area is enlarged in . bars represent 20 μm in d and 5 μm in e. next, arabidopsis seedlings expressing gfp-raba1d were treated with cytoskeletal inhibitors such as oryzalin , latrunculin b and butane-dione monoxime . previously, we observed that the motility of gfp-raba1d compartments in trichoblast cells was not affected by oryzalin-induced microtubule disruption by oryz . thus, we used acto-myosin drugs in root hairs to better characterize the movement of gfp-raba1d compartments along the actin cytoskeleton. latrunculin b disrupts the actin cytoskeleton by its binding to monomeric g-actin subunits while bdm is affecting myosin by inhibiting its atpase function. after treatment with latrunculin b, the gfp-raba1d containing tgn vesicles significantly slowed down and/or stopped their movements through the cytoplasm within 15 min. a similar effect was found after inhibition of vesicle movements using bdm . these data indicated that motility of the gfp-raba1d compartments is acto-myosin dependent. owing to the extended depth of imaging by means of light sheet microscopy, the high mobility of small raba1d-positive tgn vesicles was observed in diverse root tissues such as epidermis, cortex, endodermis, pericycle and central cylinder cells. cells in all these tissues clearly showed presence of the vesicles confirming the role of raba1d in membrane trafficking in different cells and suitability of light sheet microscopy for deep imaging in thick biological probes . discussion in this study, we reported the subcellular localization of gfp-tagged raba1d in transiently and stably transformed plant cells, describing in detail the involvement of raba1d in active and highly regulated vesicle trafficking events essential for cytokinesis of root meristematic cells and polarized cell expansion of root hairs. raba1d localizes to the early endosome/tgn and is involved in vesicle trafficking cellular distribution and localization pattern of gfp-raba1d found in both transiently transformed leaf cells and stably transformed root cells proved gfp-raba1d localization to mobile vesicle-like structures, in accordance with the role of the small gtpases in vesicle trafficking. gfp-raba1d-positive vesicular structures were recognized as tgn compartments, since they were co-labeled with mcherry-vti <dig> a snare-protein marker which accumulates at the tgn <cit> . additionally, gfp-raba1d vesicles colocalized with fm4-64-positive compartments that are labeled by this vesicular/endocytotic marker soon after entering cells. merging and co-association at tgn compartment was shown also for other members of raba class, raba <dig> raba <dig> and raba1c which partially overlapped also with the vha-a <dig> subunit <cit> . in tgn compartment, qa-snare group members localize in a complex <cit> and all these compartments are stained by fm4- <dig> before this dye reaches rabf <dig> or gnom- containing compartments <cit> . thus, the localization pattern of gfp-raba1d suggests its specific role during first stages of endocytosis and rapid vesicular trafficking, but not in the process of endosome maturation, because no colocalization with late endosomal markers fyve-dsred or mcherry-rabf2a was found. in this respect, the fyve-domain binds specifically to the phosphoinositol-3-phosphate , which accumulates mainly in the membranes of late endosomal compartments <cit> . fyve domain marker colocalized also with rabf2a and rabf <dig> today recognized as multivesicular or late endosomal rab gtpase markers <cit> . the colocalization of gfp-raba1d with early fm4- <dig> compartments was confirmed by microscopic analysis. in comparison to rabf2a, another rab-gtpase that preferentially localize to late/multivesicular endosomes <cit> , gfp-raba1d colocalized with fm4- <dig> compartments within minutes upon fm staining. partial colocalization of yfp-rabf2a with fm4- <dig> was recorded only later. the bfa treatment of transgenic plants expressing gfp-raba1d and co-stained with fm4- <dig> resulted in common relocation and accumulation of both markers in the core of bfa-compartments in root cells. since it is known that bfa-induced compartments are composed of tgn and plasma membrane-derived endocytotic vesicles in a core, surrounded by remnants of golgi stacks <cit> , this localization pattern confirms the residence of raba1d in early endosome/tgn compartments. moreover, it is suggestive of the role of raba1d in the regulation of vesicle recycling, as this process is effectively inhibited by bfa treatment <cit> . the above suggestion is further supported by the quantitative upregulation of raba1d after bfa treatment as revealed by proteomic analysis. the localization and activity of raba1d at tgn compartment <cit> and its responsiveness to bfa suggest a role in vesicle trafficking. involvement in endocytosis and vesicular recycling has been reported also for other members of raba class. raba1c, which is localized at the tgn compartment, is sensitive to endosidin <dig> but not to wortmannin <cit> . endosidin <dig> is an inhibitor of endocytosis and vesicular recycling <cit> , while wortmannin inhibits the transport to vacuoles by affecting pre-vacuolar compartments, tgn vesicles and mvbs <cit> . for instance, the effect of endosidin <dig> on bri <dig> pin <dig> and aux <dig> recycling involves also the mislocalization of early endosome/tgn-compartments, defined by syp61/vha-a <dig> <cit> . similar defects have been observed by the inhibition of vacuolar h+-atpases with concanamycin a . cona blocks the endosome maturation, which leads to production of aggregates of tgn-derived vesicles and therefore, it interferes with the formation of bfa-compartments <cit> . the mislocalization of tgn proteins vha-a <dig> raba2a and syp <dig> was also found in the ech mutant, lacking a tgn-localized echidna protein crucial for tgn function. this mutant is, however, affected rather in secretion with endocytosis being more or less intact <cit> . it raises the question on possible role of raba1d also in a secretory pathway, which would be parallel to the function of raba1b in secretory pathway from tgn to the plasma membrane <cit> . raba1b co-localize with vamp721/ <dig> r-snare proteins that operate in the secretory pathway and only partially and unstably associate with tgn, golgi and endosomes <cit> . however, the relocalization of raba1b to plasma membrane upon wortmannin treatment <cit> differs from the accumulation, clustering, fusion or swelling of tgn and mvb compartments, observed by fluorescently tagged raba1d, raba4b, raba1e, vti <dig> fyve and rabf2a <cit> . under wortmannin treatment, raba1d is relocated into wortmannin-induced multivesicular compartments and is downregulated <cit> . thereby, while the plant counteracts the inhibition of endocytotic recycling by raba1d upregulation, the inhibition of prevacuolar transport by wortmannin induces raba1d downregulation <cit> . thus, raba1d has an important role in vesicle trafficking consistent with its location at early endosome/tgn compartment. raba1d is accumulating in highly active vesicle trafficking zones during cytokinesis and root hair tip-growth cell plate arises from the accumulation, fusion and stretching of vesicles directed by centrally-localized complex of cell plate assembly matrix . these vesicles are delivered to the growing cell plate by phragmoplast microtubules <cit> , and cell plate expansion is substantially supported by machineries of both secretory and endocytotic pathways <cit> . in the growing cell plate, a ring-like structure representing highly active zone of vesicle trafficking is formed <cit> . during the initial stages of cell plate formation, gfp-raba1d accumulated in disc-like structure in the equatorial plane, exhibiting a steady increase of fluorescence intensity likely due to the continuous vesicle fusions. consistently with the spatial redistribution of active zones of vesicular trafficking during cell plate expansion <cit> , gfp-raba1d relocated labeling the rim of the growing cell plates. the localization of gfp-raba1d during cytokinesis suggests a role in delivery of cargos and membranes during cell plate formation. it is also compatible with the supporting role of raba1d in active membrane recycling at cell plate margin domains and consistent with the accumulation of raba <dig> and raba <dig> subclasses during cell plate formation. interestingly, they colocalize in the cell plate with the cytokinesis-specific syntaxin knolle <cit> . redundant cytokinetic roles have been assigned to three other rabas, namely raba1a, raba1b and raba1c. these were mislocalized following endosidin <dig> treatment, while triple knockout mutants were hypersensitive to endosidin <dig> induced cytokinetic disruption <cit> . similarly, the cytokinetic-defective mutant pas <dig> , showed delayed and defective cell plate formation due to the heterogeneous aggregation of raba2a and knolle, while rabf2a did not show any defect. thus, early endosomes/tgn compartments play a specific role during cell plate formation <cit> . the transport between tgn and the plasma membrane by raba1b interacting with vamp <dig> <cit> is involved in cytokinesis and the inhibition of trafficking at tgn by cona affects cell plate formation through the mislocalization of early endosomes/tgn compartments <cit> . additionally, the colocalization of raba1d with vti <dig> a member of snare complex, suggests a role also in the transport to the plasma membrane <cit> . thereby, the role of raba1d during cell plate formation is consistent with the proposed activity of early endosome/tgn compartments in the coordination of secretory, endocytotic and recycling pathways. similarly to cytokinesis, raba1d participates in localized cell expansion where increased vesicle trafficking is required. the tip-accumulation of raba1d in root hair bulges and in growing root hairs confirmed the role of some rabas during polar growth. the disruption of raba4d in pollen tubes reduced cell polarity, expansion and displayed altered deposition of cell wall components <cit> . raba4b showed tip-localization and regulated root hair tip growth through a compartment involved in the polarized secretion, and similarly to raba1d, the tip-localized accumulation disappears in mature root hairs or after latrunculin b treatment <cit> . the raba <dig> silencing led to reduction in number and length of the root hairs, showing an important role not only in expansion but also during root hair initiation <cit> . the raba1d accumulation in bulge stage was increased during the progression to the tip growth. in growing root hairs, gfp-raba1d signal intensity fluctuated in oscillatory manner. oscillations between lower and higher intensity labeling of gfp-raba1d at the root hair tip temporally coincided with the pause and growth phases of root hair tip growth, respectively. similarly to pollen tubes <cit> , root hairs exhibit oscillatory growth along with other events accompanying tip growth like cell wall modifications, cytoskeleton rearrangements and targeted vesicle trafficking <cit> . some factors, such as ca2+ gradient <cit> , extracellular ph and ros concentration <cit> and actin organization <cit> have been found to be associated with the oscillatory character of tip growth and are closely related to vesicle trafficking. consistently with the frequency of vesicular trafficking during root hair initiation and growth, gfp-raba1d accumulation was lower at bulge stage than in growing root hairs. after the local structural changes that are required to define the bulge position, such as cytoskeleton rearrangements <cit> , cell wall composition <cit> and accumulation of structural sterols in the plasma membrane <cit> , an increased vesicle trafficking is required during root hair elongation to provide a new plasma membrane in the expanding zone. this zone is filled with secretory and endocytotic vesicles <cit> , highly dynamic early endosomes in the clear zone and larger endosomal compartments in the subapical region <cit> . thereby, raba1d is localized at the tip-zone of growing root hair as previously reported <cit> and its accumulation is spatio-temporally correlated with the root hair tip expansion and vesicle trafficking. high motility of tgn vesicles containing gfp-raba1d depends on the actin cytoskeleton endosomes show different patterns of motility including stationary phases, slow or rapid movements <cit> . the microtubule disruption by oryzalin did not affect the motility of raba1d-positive vesicles, however the acto-myosin inhibitors affected extremely their motility. similarly, the tip-localization of raba4b was affected by latrunculin b treatment but not by oryzalin <cit> . it suggests an important role of actin cytoskeleton in raba1d motility, however, the organization and dynamics of several endosomal structures is influenced by both actin and microtubule cytoskeletons <cit> and their motor proteins, i.e. myosins <cit> . the role of the actin cytoskeleton in vesicular trafficking was strengthened by proteomic study after bfa treatment, which showed significant upregulation of profilin <dig> and its accumulation in bfa-compartments <cit> . finally, vigorous motility of raba1d-containing tgn vesicles was also observed in diverse root tissues such as epidermis, cortex, endodermis, pericycle and central cylinder cells confirming the role of raba1d in vesicular trafficking in different cells and not only associated to tip-growth. CONCLUSIONS we show that raba1d colocalized with early fm4- <dig> endocytotic compartments and with vti <dig> a tgn marker. bfa treatment not only induced raba1d upregulation but also relocalization of gfp-raba1d to the core of bfa-compartments. most importantly, a specific spatio-temporal accumulation of raba1d correlated with vesicle trafficking requirements during both cell plate formation and root hair oscillatory tip growth.",

    "prompt": "Capture the main imaging findings in a few sentences. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND lysophosphatidic acid is a signalling phospholipid mediating multiple biological responses, such as cellular proliferation, prevention of apoptosis, and platelet aggregation, and is involved in the development and function of the nervous, cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems <cit> . aberrant lpa signalling has been claimed to be associated with the pathology of common human diseases, such as arteriosclerosis <cit> and cancer <cit> . signalling by lpa is mainly mediated through specific g protein-coupled receptors <cit> . the receptors for lpa are widely expressed, being found in the brain, circulation and digestive tract. currently, there are five gpcrs that have been identified as bona fide receptors for lpa along with a putative sixth receptor <cit> . physiologically relevant levels of lpa can be found in serum and other body fluids. in addition, several cell types, including platelets, adipocytes, and ovarian cancer cells, can produce and release lpa. significant amounts of lpa have been detected from brain tissue <cit> . it is postulated that the majority of bioactive lpa is generated extracellularly from lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylcholine , by the plasma ecto-enzyme, lysophospholipase d, identical to autotaxin, an autocrine motility factor originally isolated from the conditioned medium of cancer cells <cit> . intracellularly, lpa can be generated by phospholipase a1/a <dig> -catalyzed deacylation of phosphatidic acid <cit> . other proposed pathways for lpa generation include de novo biosynthesis either from glycerol-3-phosphate by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase or from monoacylglycerol by monoacylglycerol kinase <cit> . after being produced, the lifetime of the signalling pool of lpa is thought to be controlled by enzymatic degradation. lpa is rapidly dephosphorylated by a family of integral membrane proteins known as lipid phosphate phosphatases <cit> . the lpp family comprises four members which dephosphorylate their lipid substrates, namely lpa, pa, sphingosine 1-phosphate , and ceramide 1-phosphate <cit> . all the lpp subtypes are expressed in the brain <cit> but very little is known about their functional roles. a hallmark of lpp activity is that it does not require mg2+ and is resistant to the alkylating agent, n-ethylmaleimide <cit> . the other known pathways for lpa metabolism include de novo formation of pa by lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase and lysophospholipase -catalyzed hydrolysis of the acyl group to form glycerophosphate <cit> . the two degradative pathways generating inorganic phosphate as a result of lpa degradation are depicted in figure <dig> 35 s]gtpγs autoradiography represents a powerful functional approach to anatomically localize receptor-dependent gi/o protein activity directly in brain cryosections . in addition to a receptor’s anatomical distribution, 35 s]gtpγs autoradiography can monitor the receptor-g protein axis in its native cellular microenvironment and is therefore often referred to as functional autoradiography. our previous studies have demonstrated that brain sections retain the capacity to generate endogenous gpcr agonists, such as adenosine and lpa, during incubation. this results in tonic adenosine a <dig> and lpa receptor activity in anatomically defined brain regions and therefore serves as a convenient functional readout to monitor agonist activity at the two receptors <cit> . the lpa-evoked 35 s]gtpγs binding response in rat brain sections reflects lpa <dig> receptor activity, as it is sensitive to the lpa1/3-selective antagonist ki <dig> and is restricted to the developing white matter tracts <cit> . this labelling pattern faithfully mirrors the known expression pattern of lpa <dig> receptors in the developing rat brain <cit> . our previous studies indicated that the enzymatic machinery generating and metabolizing membrane-derived lipid mediators was well preserved in brain cryosections. we recently demonstrated that a comprehensive elimination of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol in brain sections leads to 2-ag accumulation and subsequent cannabinoid cb <dig> receptor activation, as successfully revealed using functional autoradiography <cit> . using this approach, we show here that pharmacological inhibition of lpp activity in brain sections with vanadate or propranolol results in amplification of lpa <dig> receptor signalling with no net effect on global lpa phosphatase activity at the bulk brain level, also attributable to mg2+ -independent, nem-resistant lpp-like phosphatases. we show further that the phosphate analog alfx- not only potentiates lpa <dig> receptor signalling, but also totally prevents lpa degradation, resulting in the accumulation of several lpa species in brain sections, as demonstrated by lc/ms/ms measurements. the presently described approach offers a versatile tool to monitor the strength of lipid-gpcr signalling axis in anatomically defined brain structures and may prove useful also for further studies exploring enzymatic pathways estimating the lifetime of still uncharacterized endogenous signalling lipids. RESULTS the lpp inhibitors na3vo <dig> and propranolol locally amplify lpa <dig> receptor signalling without affecting global lpa degradation the lpp-mediated degradation of lpa is susceptible to the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate <cit> and to propranolol <cit> , better known as a classical β-adrenoceptor blocking agent e.g. used in the treatment of hypertension. another β-blocker, nadolol, has no demonstrable lpp inhibiting capacity <cit> and therefore can serve as a useful control compound. we tested the effects of these compounds on basal lpa <dig> receptor signalling. treatment of brain sections with propranolol or na3vo <dig> resulted in stimulated 35 s]gtpγs binding responses that were restricted to the white matter areas of 4 week-old rat brain . the observed labelling pattern was fully reproduced by the addition of exogenous lpa and all the evoked responses, including the tonic lpa <dig> receptor activity observed under basal conditions, were abolished by treatment with the lpa1/ <dig> receptor selective antagonist ki <dig> . previously, we demonstrated that ki <dig> dose-dependently diminished the basal and lpa-evoked 35 s]gtpγs binding responses in the white matter tracts <cit> . dose–response studies revealed that the maximal effective concentrations for na3vo <dig> and propranolol were 100 μm and 1 mm, respectively . as expected, treatment with nadolol had no effect on basal lpa <dig> receptor signalling . both na3vo <dig> and propranolol, but not nadolol, amplified the lpa-evoked binding responses . to rule out the direct agonism of propranolol and vanadate at the lpa <dig> receptor, we performed classical filtration-based 35 s]gtpγs binding assay and found that neither compound was able to stimulate 35 s]gtpγs binding to the rat cerebellar membranes, whereas exogenous lpa evoked a dose-dependent response . we additionally observed that the lpa <dig> receptor-preferring agonist -ompt induced only a weak response in the brain of a 4-week old rat when compared to signal achieved with exogenous lpa -ompt). this lends further support to the argument that observed lpa-evoked signalling is reflecting the activity of the myelin enriched lpa <dig> receptors instead of lpa <dig> receptors that are expressed to a lesser degree in the brain <cit> . finally, we found that exogenously added autotaxin substrate lpc did not boost tonic lpa <dig> receptor activity suggesting that tonic lpa <dig> activity in brain sections is not due to lpa formed as a result of autotaxin activity . the lpps catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphate group of their lipid substrates resulting in the generation of inorganic phosphate . the measurement of the released pi offers a straightforward way to monitor lpp activity <cit> . in preliminary experiments, incubation of brain sections with exogenously added lpa, pa and s1p resulted in pi formation, indicating that lysophospholipid-degrading phosphatases were active under the assay conditions employed . to confirm that pi generation was dependent on brain tissue, empty slides were incubated under identical conditions but in this case, there was no generation of pi from lpa . further studies with lpa indicated, that lpp-like phosphatase activity accounted for the majority of lpa degradation, as ~ 93% of lpa-derived pi was formed as a result of mg2+-independent, nem-resistant phosphatase activity . in the routine assay buffer containing mg2+, 46 ± 1% of exogenous lpa was degraded during the 90 min incubation whereas in the mg2+-free assay buffer supplemented with nem , the respective figure was 44 ± 3%. however, neither the lpp inhibitors na3vo <dig> , propranolol , nor nadolol affected total lpa phosphatase activity in a statistically significant manner, assessed at the bulk level of brain sections . in line with this, when the lpa content of brain sections treated with na3vo <dig> or propranolol was analyzed using lc/ms/ms, there was no significant accumulation of lpa when compared to control sections that were incubated in the absence of these inhibitors . we undertook a search for additional inhibitors in an attempt to identify compounds that could comprehensively target the global pool of lpa phosphatases in brain sections. the phosphate analog aluminium fluoride amplifies lpa <dig> receptor signalling and totally prevents lpa degradation resulting in bulk accumulation of endogenous lpa species sodium fluoride is commonly used as a phosphatase inhibitor. aluminium fluoride acts as a transition stage phosphate analog also capable of inhibiting several phosphatases <cit> . alfx- forms spontaneously in aqueous solutions in the presence of aluminium and fluoride ions. we pretreated brain sections with naf or alfx- in order to test whether these compounds could affect lpa receptor activity and/or lpa degradation. interestingly, when sections were pretreated with alfx- , a stimulated 35 s]gtpγs binding response throughout the lpa <dig> receptor-enriched white matter regions was evident . this labelling pattern was fully mimicked by the addition of exogenous lpa , and was blocked by ki <dig> . similarly, pretreatment of brain sections with naf resulted in stimulated 35 s]gtpγs binding responses throughout the white matter regions . pretreatment with these compounds was sufficient to evoke lpa <dig> receptor signalling, suggesting that in contrast to the reversibly acting inhibitors na3vo <dig> and propranolol , alfx- and naf had inhibited lpp activity in an irreversible manner. we wished to explore in more detail the mode of inhibition of these compounds, as well as the behaviour of naf in our experimental setting. this was justified by the fact that aluminium is a common constituent of glassware and f- can etch it from the glass. deforoxamine mesylate is an aluminium and iron chelator that can be used in experimental settings to reveal if aluminium is present in the system. when brain sections were treated with dfom , the responses to alfx- and naf in functional autoradiography were totally abolished . it is noteworthy that dfom needed to be added together with alfx- or naf in order to achieve this reversal; if added after pretreatment with alfx- or naf, dfom was ineffective . these studies indicate that alfx- acted as an irreversible inhibitor of brain lpp activity thereby amplifying tonic lpa <dig> receptor activity. the general phosphatase inhibitor, naf per se, did not inhibit lpps, but mimicked the action of alfx- based on the ability of f- to etch al3+ from the glass slides. we were curious to examine whether alfx- could also inhibit lpa degradation at the bulk brain level. when sections were pretreated with alfx- but then omitted from all subsequent steps, alfx- readily facilitated lpa <dig> receptor signalling , but such a pretreatment did not inhibit lpa degradation in a statistically significant manner. degradation of exogenous lpa alone yielded <dig> ± <dig> nmol pi per slide whereas pretreatment with alfx- followed by incubation with exogenous lpa yielded <dig> ± <dig> nmol pi per slide . however, when added together with lpa, alfx- totally blocked the formation of lpa-derived pi, thus providing evidence of the ability of these compounds to inhibit the vanadate- and propranolol-insensitive pool of lpa phosphatases in a reversible manner . treatment with dfom totally prevented the ability of alfx- and naf to inhibit the degradation of lpa , indicating that alfx-, rather than naf, was the active compound. to further explore the consequences of total inhibition of lpa phosphatase activity, alfx- -treated brain sections were incubated for 40 min in autoradiography buffer, the buffer was removed and tissue lpa content extracted using chloroform-methanol, followed by lc/ms/ms analysis. four lpa species with different acyl substitutions were examined in the present study. the relative abundances of the four lpa species in brain sections incubated under control conditions were 20: <dig> lpa ≈ 16: <dig> lpa < 18: <dig> lpa < 18: <dig> lpa. the amounts of three of these species were significantly increased after alfx- treatment when compared to control sections . these experiments indicate that total blockade of lpa phosphatase activity with alfx- treatment resulted in accumulation of several endogenous lpa species at the bulk brain level. however, no such bulk lpa accumulation was required to observe the alfx- -evoked potentiation of lpa <dig> receptor signalling. the lpa → mag → g pathway efficiently degrades exogenous lpa whereas the lpa → gp → g pathway is inactive in addition to the lpa → mag → g pathway , another pi generating pathway for lpa degradation involves its deacylation to form glycerophosphate which is further dephosphorylated by glycerophosphatases to glycerol . since there are two degradative pathways for lpa that potentially release pi, we wished to clarify which pathway accounts for lpa degradation in our model. rat cerebellar membranes have been extensively used in our laboratory to study degradation of labile lipid messengers such as endocannabinoids <cit> . since lpa <dig> receptors are known to be present in the cerebellum <cit> we performed kinetic monitoring of pi production from exogenous lpa and glycerol 3-phosphate after incubation with rat cerebellar membranes in 96-well-format. in this setting, cerebellar membranes generated pi from lpa but there was no pi generation from gp , indicating that the pi formed from lpa in our experimental setting is principally due to lpp/lpp-like activity. as a further proof, we used the dephosphorylation-resistant thio-analog of lpa, -ompt, that is also the lpa <dig> receptor.-preferring agonist. as expected, there was no pi generation from -ompt . since both of the two pi releasing pathways for lpa degradation finally produce glycerol, we assessed cerebellar membrane-dependent glycerol generation from exogenous lpa in brain tissue. monoglyceride lipase is believed to be mainly responsible for the mag → g conversion. in addition, two novel α/β-hydrolase domain containing proteins, abhd <dig> and abhd <dig> have been identified to hydrolyze brain endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol <cit> and together the three serine hydrolases account for ~99% of brain 2-ag hydrolase activity <cit> . it is therefore likely that in addition to mgl, abhd <dig> and abhd <dig> are involved in the degradation of both 1- and 2-monoacylglycerols. to delineate the relative contributions of the three hydrolases, we pretreated cerebellar membranes with two serine hydrolase inhibitors, methylarachidonoylfluorophosphonate and compound jzl <dig> the former is a potent, non-selective inhibitor of mgl <cit> that also inhibits abhd6/abhd <dig> whereas the latter is a mgl-selective inhibitor <cit> . as expected, in rat cerebellar membranes incubated together with lpa , glycerol production closely matches with pi generation , indicating that mag → g conversion takes place under the assay conditions employed. with mafp pretreatment , lpa-derived glycerol production was decreased by 91% . with jzl <dig> pretreatment , the corresponding reduction was 71% . the selectivity of the inhibitors towards mgl likely explains the difference in the inhibition of glycerol production from lpa between the two inhibitors. the time-dependent generation of pi and glycerol from exogenous lpa is presented in figure 7c. it appears that pi generation precedes that of g, a finding supporting sequential actions of phosphatases and lipases on the lpa → mag → g pathway. discussion functional autoradiography provides a straightforward approach to study the proximal step of signalling of various gi/o-coupled receptors in brain cryosections. we recently demonstrated that brain sections retain the capacity to generate endocannabinoids during incubations i.e. evidence of the ability of the brain sections to preserve sufficient functional enzymatic machinery to generate endogenous gpcr activating ligands <cit> . the lifetime of the signalling pool of lpa is thought to be controlled by the equilibrium between synthesizing and degradative enzymatic activity. in the current study, we have characterized these enzymatic pathways and their role in tonic lpa <dig> receptor activity by pharmacologically manipulating the enzymatic machinery required for lpa degradation. we observed that in brain sections, the lifetime of bioactive lpa is controlled by mg2+-independent, nem-insensitive phosphatase activity attributable to lpps. pharmacological inhibition of this lpp activity by alfx-, propranolol or sodium orthovanadate amplified lpa <dig> receptor signalling, as revealed using functional autoradiography. we provided further evidence to show that the majority of brain lpa phosphatase activity seems to be carried out by lpp-like enzymatic activity which like lpp activity, is sensitive to alfx- but appears to be resistant to the two other lpp inhibitors, vanadate and propranolol. finally, we demonstrated that degradation of exogenous lpa is almost entirely channelled via the lpa → mag → g pathway and that mgl accounts for the majority of oleylglycerol-hydrolyzing activity in brain tissue. all the three subtypes of mg2+-independent/nem resistant lpps are expressed in the brain, yet very little is known about the role of the lpps as regulators of lpa receptor signalling in the nervous system. knockout studies of all the lpp subtypes have been reported <cit> . study with lpp <dig> knockout mice indicated that lpp <dig> plays a role in regulating the degradation of circulating lpa in vivo but that study failed to disrupt the lpp <dig> encoding gene in the brain, obscuring the function of lpp <dig> in the nervous system <cit> . knockout of lpp <dig> turned out to be embryonically lethal <cit> whereas in vitro studies using cell lines lacking lpp <dig> address involvement of lpp <dig> in early neural development <cit> . the lpps are likely to be involved in lpa dephosphorylation in brain cryosections, as brain sections efficiently generate pi from exogenous lpa largely in a nem resistant and mg2+-independent way. propranolol and vanadate have been demonstrated to inhibit lpps in various cell types <cit> , vanadate also in the rat brain <cit> . propranolol has been shown to act as a moderately effective inhibitor of lpps <cit> supporting our finding where the vanadate-induced response is relatively stronger when compared to the response observed with propranolol. since propranolol and vanadate amplified lpa <dig> receptor signalling only when present in the 35 s]gtpγs labelling step, these drugs presumably inhibit lpps in a reversible manner. in brain sections, lpp activity appears to locally control the lifetime of the signalling pool of lpa and lpps must therefore reside in close proximity to the lpa <dig> receptors, as propranolol and vanadate had no effect on lpa degradation when assessed at the bulk brain level. in functional autoradiography, alfx- more efficiently induced the lpa <dig> receptor-mediated signal as compared to the signals observed with vanadate or propranolol. since alfx- is able to induce the lpa <dig> receptor-mediated signal when present only in the pre-incubation step, it appears to inhibit lpps in an irreversible manner. this proposal is supported by the finding that the al3+ chelator dfom failed to reverse alfx- -evoked response, if added only after pretreatment of brain sections with alfx- . alfx- is known to mimic the chemical structure of phosphate and therefore affects the activity of several phosphoryl transfer enzymes <cit> . as a phosphate analog, alfx- might bind to the pi recognizing binding pocket of the lpps and by this mechanism lead to irreversible inhibition. all the studied inhibitors evoked 35 s]gtpγs binding responses that were largely restricted to the white matter areas of the brain when compared to grey matter reflecting to selectivity towards the myelin-enriched lpa <dig> receptors. this also provides evidence to show, that though alfx- is known to act as a general activator of heterotrimeric g proteins, it seems not to induce global binding response in the grey matter areas and therefore seems not to act as a general g protein activator in functional autoradiography. it is notable that in contrast to propranolol and vanadate, when present in the latter step together with exogenous lpa, alfx- totally prevented the degradation of lpa at the bulk brain level, suggesting that in addition to irreversibly inhibiting lpps, alfx- can inhibit other lpp-like phosphatases in a reversible manner. based on the present findings, the major portion of brain lpa phosphatase activity appears to be attributable to the lpp-like phosphatases which in a similar manner as lpps, are sensitive to alfx- but resistant to the lpp inhibitors, vanadate and propranolol. since there was no pi generation from exogenous glycerol 3-phosphate, it seems that lpa is predominantly degraded by the lpa → mag → g pathway in our experimental setting whereas the lpa → gp → g pathway plays a minor role. according to our findings, both phosphohydrolases and mgl and related hydrolases seem to be active. the pi- and glycerol -generating enzymatic routes involved in lpa degradation are summarized in additional file 8: summary of enzymatic routes generating pi and glycerol. previously, nem-insensitive lpa phosphohydrolase activity was studied in the nuclear fraction isolated from rabbit cerebral cortex <cit> . this activity was found to be present also in the microsomal fraction. in the nuclear fraction, phosphohydrolase activity was found to be sensitive to naf but virtually insensitive to propranolol . dephosphorylation by phosphohydrolases was found to be more active route for lpa degradation when compared to deacylation by lysophospholipases. it was also indicated that followed by dephosphorylation of lpa, monoacyl product is rapidly converted to glycerol by monoglyceride lipase. these findings support our present findings concerning active pathways involved in lpa degradation in brain as well as about the existence of lpp-like, propranolol and vanadate -insensitive, phosphohydrolase activity. the lpp-like phosphatases remain to be characterized in future experiments. one interesting group of brain-specific membrane proteins are plasticity related genes that have recently been identified and were originally proposed to act as lpa phosphatases <cit> . among the family of prgs, prg- <dig> shares close homology to the lpps, having three conserved integral domains facing the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, the feature that enables lpps to dephosphorylate their lipid substrates. however, the catalytic residues responsible for lpp activity are not fully conserved in prgs <cit> suggesting that prgs might not act as lpa phosphatases. instead, pgr- <dig> was recently demonstrated to act at the postsynaptic side of the excitatory glutamatergic synapse where it could mediate the uptake of bioactive lipids <cit> . prg- <dig> was found to effectively control the levels of lpa in the synapse though its mechanism of action seems to be more transporter-like than dephosphorylating. the transporter mechanism is not expected to be active in our experimental setting and therefore we hypothesize that prgs are not controlling lpa levels in our model. CONCLUSIONS we demonstrate that the lifetime of bioactive lpa is controlled by lpps in rat brain cryosections and that pharmacological inhibition of this lpp activity results in amplification of basal and lpa-stimulated lpa <dig> receptor activity. we conclude that lpp acts locally to control the lifetime of the signalling pool of lpa in the vicinity of lpa <dig> receptors whereas the majority of brain lpa phosphatase activity is attributable to additional lpp-like enzymatic activity. functional autoradiography represents a valuable tool for studies into lpa degradation by lpps and lpp-like enzymatic activity. compounds affecting lpa degradation could prove to be attractive targets for drug development, since altered lpa levels are associated with common human diseases, e.g. several forms of cancer. the approach described in this paper may also prove useful for further studies elucidating enzymatic pathways regulating the lifetime of still uncharacterized endogenous signalling lipids.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the clinical significance of the findings below. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND plants in the brassica genus display extreme morphological diversity, from cauliflower and broccoli through cabbages and brussels sprouts to turnips and oil crops. almost all organs are used for consumption: heads of cabbages and leaves on non-heading vegetable types, inflorescences of cauliflowers, tuberized stems/hypocotyls and/or roots of kohlrabi’s, turnips and swede and enlarged seeds and seedpods of oil types. one of the most important brassica species, brassica rapa, also shows this extreme morphological divergence, likely selected for by plant breeders all over the world, with heading and non-heading leafy crops, turnips and both annual and biannual oil crops. next to its economic value, b. rapa is also of particular interest in the study of genome evolution, because of its recent genome triplication after divergence from the common ancestor of arabidopsis and brassica <cit> . the genome sequence of the mesopolyploid crop species b. rapa ssp. pekinesis chiifu, a chinese cabbage, was published in <dig> as the first b. rapa reference genome <cit> . interestingly, most retained paralogous genes in this genome still show higher similarity to each other than to their orthologs in a. thaliana. comparative mapping studies identified a putative ancestral karyotype of the current arabidopsis and brassica genomes, with <dig> conserved chromosomal blocks, as well as an on-going process of biased gene loss called gene fractionation in three subgenomes of b. rapa <cit> . these subgenomes have been reconstructed by grouping the <dig> conserved blocks: the least fractionated subgenome , with the highest gene densities; the medium fractionated subgenome , with moderate gene densities; and the most fractionated subgenome , with the lowest gene densities <cit> . our main research goal is to understand the genetic drivers underlying the enormous morphological variation between b. rapa subspecies. in this study, we therefore consider two b. rapa genomes – those of a vegetable turnip double haploid line and a rapid cycling inbred line – as representatives of the very distinct morphotypes turnip and annual oil . the vegetable turnip has an enlarged hypocotyl/root, whereas the rapid cycling line is developed in wisconsin by intercrossing mainly annual oils and pakchois/caixins and selecting for earliness in flowering <cit> . as recent studies suggested that the genome-wide density of variants is much higher between accessions of one plant species than between lines in one mammalian species, in this study we not only resequenced the turnip and rapid cycling line genomes, but also assembled and re-annotated them, resulting in two new reference genomes .figure <dig> three brassica rapa plants. left: the chinese cabbage cultivar, chiifu; middle: an oil-like rapid cycling line ; right: japanese vegetable turnip . these two new genomes were combined with the reference chiifu genome to form an initial b. rapa pan-genome. this concept was raised first in the study of bacterial species, to define the full complement of genes of several closely related strains <cit> . in a pan-genome, we can distinguish common genes, present in all accessions of a species; dispensable genes, occurring in more than one genome; and unique genes, specific to a single genome <cit> . in the b. rapa pan-genome, we find such genes and explore functional annotations of the unique gene set to find morphotype-specific genes. we also analyze the orthology of genes in the pan-genome to arabidopsis thaliana and thellungiella halophila to find lost genes and retained genes . finally, using orthologous genes we estimate the divergence date of the three b. rapa species and find that it far precedes domestication. the two newly assembled and annotated genomes are available to the community as an online resource at http://www.bioinformatics.nl/brassica/turnip and http://www.bioinformatics.nl/brassica/rapid-cycling, accompanied by the tools developed to explore the pan-genome.figure <dig>

reference genome chiifu to get a comparable genome annotation for all three b. rapa species, we first re-annotated the chiifu reference genome using maker <cit> . this re-annotation covered about 85% of the original <dig> gene models found in the brassica database , resulting in <dig> gene models of which <dig> were novel predictions <cit> . the re-annotation covered about 90% of the exons from the brassica database . the remaining <dig> exons, roughly 10%, were mainly located in low complexity regions of the genome. as expected, when we decreased the minimum overlap required for matching

and chiifu in the bottom three rows. common variations have the same sequence composition at the same position in both rapid cycling and turnip; unique variations have different nucleotides between the three genomes at the same position. re-annotation of turnip and rapid cycling the genome sequences of turnip and rapid cycling were reconstructed by applying all genomic variation found to the reference genome. the total lengths of both resulting genomes were almost the same as that of the reference genome : <dig> mbs for turnip and <dig> mbs for rapid cycling. before re-annotation of the reference genomes, nearly half of its gene models appeared to be affected by changes in the protein coding region in either turnip or rapid cycling with moderate to high impact <cit> . re-annotation of the turnip and rapid cycling genomes resulted in <dig> and <dig> predicted gene models respectively, slightly below the number found in the reference genome . after re-annotation, the number of genes found in the turnip and rapid cycling genomes which changed function or became pseudogenes with respect to the chiifu genome was only <dig> resp. <dig> .figure <dig> number of genes predicted to be functionally affected by genomic variants. before annotation, genes were considered functionally affected in the rapid cycling line or in turnip when one of the following variants was found w.r.t. the chiifu genome: splice_site_acceptor, splice_site_donor, start_lost, exon_deleted, frame_shift, stop_gained or stop_lost. genes were considered affected if they had no orthologous gene at the same chromosome/scaffold of chiifu genome after its re-annotation. pan-genome construction and detection of retained and lost genes most of the genomic variation maps to intergenic regions, followed by introns, exons and utrs . after re-annotation of the rapid cycling and turnip genomes, <dig> genes are found to be common, i.e. present in all three genomes while <dig> , <dig> and <dig> genes are unique to turnip, rapid cycling and chiifu respectively . functional annotation of these genes resulted in <dig> gene ontology assignments to <dig> genes .table <dig> number of genomic variants

<dig> genes classified as common in the b. rapa pan genome; the number of unique genes was <dig> in chiifu, <dig> in turnip and <dig> in rapid cycling. in total, we thus found <dig> unique genes, found in only one of the three genomes; all remaining non-unique, non-common genes we called dispensable. about <dig> out of <dig> unique and dispensable genes in turnip could be annotated with at least one go term, as was the case for <dig> out of <dig> genes in rapid cycling and <dig> out of <dig> in chiifu. most of these genes were assigned to only ten biological process go terms, seven of which were common to the three genomes . gene models predicted from contigs that could not be mapped against the chiifu genome were annotated separately. the number of genes thus found with at least one go term annotation was <dig> for the turnip genome and <dig> for the rapid cycling genome . most unique and dispensable genes mapped to the lf subgenome, the least mapped to the mf <dig> subgenome. corrected for total gene count, the proportion of genes affected by changes to their protein coding region is lowest in the lf subgenome .table <dig> top ten go biological processes with most genes assigned in chiifu, turnip and rapid cycling only dispensable and unique genes were included in the analysis. the term “response to stress” is the most over-represented and seven out of

less fractionated subgenome, with the highest gene densities; mf1: more fractionated subgenome <dig> with moderate gene densities; mf2: most fractionated subgenome <dig> with lowest gene densities. to study gene copy number variation in the b. rapa pan-genome, orthology between genes in b. rapa and its close relatives arabidopsis thaliana and thellungiella halophila was computed. for the common gene set we found <dig> orthologs in a. thaliana and <dig> in t. halophile. the numbers of genes with one, two or three orthologous genes in b. rapa were <dig> / <dig> / <dig> in a. thaliana and <dig> / <dig> / <dig> in t. halophila . further analysis of the b. rapa dispensable and unique genes with orthologous genes in either a. thaliana or t. halophila showed that the rapid cycling line and turnip dh line had over 40% resp. 30% less retained genes w.r.t. a. thaliana than chiifu, yet an approximately equal number of lost genes .table <dig> orthologous genes of arabidopsis thaliana and

the retained and lost genes. the latest curated gene family assignment of a. thaliana genes from tair was used. * the number of b. rapa unique and dispensable genes without a. thaliana or t. halophile orthologous genes. functional annotation of dispensable and unique genes in the chiifu, turnip and rapid cycling genomes the unique and dispensable genes can be placed in <dig> kegg pathways in turnip, <dig> in rapid cycling and <dig> in chiifu, with starch and sucrose metabolism containing the largest proportion of genes <cit> . these genes are also found in <dig> <dig> resp. <dig> plant-specific pathways hosted by the plant metabolic network in plantcyc <cit> . genes are much more scattered over different metabolic pathways in plantcyc than in kegg <cit> . the number of genes found in any pathway in plantcyc is less than half of the number of genes found in kegg since fewer enzymes are associated with each plantcyc metabolic pathway . go enrichment analysis shows that the dispensable and unique genes in chiifu have both the most overrepresented and underrepresented go terms, while the dispensable and unique genes in rapid cycling have the least overrepresented and underrepresented terms and turnip has <dig> overrepresented and <dig> underrepresented terms. the number of genes assigned to enriched go terms is higher in turnip than in chiifu and rapid cycling . genes with association to different morphotypes next, we specifically looked for genes potentially related to morphological variation, by considering retained and lost genes with orthologs in both a. thaliana and t. halophila. only a small percentage of these, 15% of the retained and 10% of the lost genes, could be categorized into known a. thaliana gene families . the set of unique and dispensable genes found in turnip is enriched for the go cellular component term “peroxisome”, and contains class iii peroxidases among both lost and retained genes. to refine our understanding of a possible role of peroxidases in turnip formation, we more closely investigated b. rapa genes orthologous to <dig> peroxidase related genes in a. thaliana <cit> . we exploited synteny information to support the confidence in orthology predictions and to help distinguishing true orthologs, since a. thaliana and b. rapa are evolutionary very close <cit> . b. rapa orthologs of five a. thaliana genes were retained and of four a. thaliana genes were lost in turnip compared to chiifu and rapid cycling . we found proteins functionally interacting with these genes using string <cit> . four of the five retained genes were involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and the fifth, at3g <dig> , a glutathione peroxidase, may contribute to glutathione synthesis. only one of the four a. thaliana orthologs of the lost genes, at5g <dig> , was predicted to interact with other proteins in string, whereas both per <dig> and another lost gene at1g <dig> are also involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. we then examined all genes known to be involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway in a. thaliana and found that while orthologs of genes encoding a peroxidase were enriched in turnip, genes encoding a 4-coumarate-coa ligase or a coniferyl-alcohol glucosyltransferase were underrepresented. the six a. thaliana genes encoding this ligase have ten orthologs in the common gene set of b. rapa, but only two b. rapa genes are orthologous to three a. thaliana genes coding for the glucosyltransferase. this suggests the lower copy number of genes in turnip coding for the glucosyltransferase may cause the reduction of 4-d-glucoside, coniferin, syringin and hence increase the production of different lignins .table <dig> gene family assignment for retained and lost genes

using this workflow, provided there is sufficient computational power. discussion variability in the b. rapa pan-genome the three b. rapa genomes considered in this work – chiifu, turnip and rapid cycling – differ by about <dig> per <dig> base pairs, considerably less than the differences between lines of maize but very close to differences between various accessions of a. thaliana and of rice <cit> . to further investigate the pan-genomic variation, we focused on the unique genes, on average <dig> per b. rapa genome. the frequency of functional unique genes over the three subgenomes agrees with the theory that one of the subgenomes is dominant and hence has the lowest percentage of affected genes . we expected the number of unique genes in each b. rapa genome to be larger than the average number of unique genes found in different a. thaliana accessions, mainly because the morphological variation between a tuber forming turnip, a heading cabbage and an oilseed rapid cycling is larger than between, say, three a. thaliana accessions. additionally, the recent genome triplication in b. rapa may have lowered selective pressure on a subset of the genes. however, a recent study analyzing <dig> a. thaliana accessions found only <dig> unique genes per accession on average. such a comparison is not completely fair however, as the a. thaliana comparisons used a different definition of unique gene. we thus selected the three a. thaliana accessions with the highest number of genes with predicted major disruptions, and used the protein sequences of their gene models to find unique genes by exactly the same process as in our study. this yielded on average <dig> unique genes, higher than the <dig> found in the b. rapa genomes. one explanation may be that the effective population size is much higher for a. thaliana than for b. rapa, which went through several domestication bottlenecks. additionally, the three b. rapa genotypes are all landraces growing in protected agricultural settings, with varieties selected by breeders and farmers, while a. thaliana is a weed that grows in natural environments under diverse abiotic and biotic stresses with different selection forces. our findings are also in line with a previous study, in which the genetic variation in a b. rapa core collection representing all morphotypes and geographical origins was analyzed based on molecular marker profiles <cit> . bayesian clustering implemented in the structure software revealed four subpopulations, each representing different morphotypes . amova results indicated that the percentage of variation found within sub-populations/morphotypes is much larger than the variation among populations , suggesting that only a small percentage of the polymorphisms relate to the sepcific observed morphological differences. genomic determinants of morphological variation studying the functions of unique and dispensable genes could reveal whether they play a role in the extreme morphological differences between the three plants. through functional annotation, we found that peroxidases are good candidates for genes involved in the definition of plant morphology. peroxidases play a role in protection from biotic and abiotic stresses, but also in lignin formation. four of five turnip specific retained b. rapa genes orthologous to a. thaliana peroxidases are involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. phenylpropanoids are a group of plant secondary metabolites and specific compounds differentially accumulate in particular tissues with specialized functions. these results suggest that lignin may be important for turnip tuber formation, which can relate to the increased numbers of xylem vessels in the turnip tuber. in this paper we focus on the dna level, but it is entirely possible that turnip formation is regulated at the transcriptional or even post-translational level. gene loss occurred more in rapid cycling than in turnip and chiifu . rapid cycling may have a different composition of flowering time genes because it was generated by crossing early flowering b. rapa genotypes to create a morphotype with a short life cycle for educational purposes <cit> . to verify this hypothesis, we looked for genes in the three b. rapa genomes orthologous to <dig> known flowering related a. thaliana genes. these flowering genes were classified into five different categories, including flower development, gibberellin-, photoperiod/circadian rhythm- and vernalization pathway and metabolic processes . in rapid cycling, there are five lost genes related to flowering time , compared to only three in chiifu and turnip .table <dig> flowering time related lost genes in three b. rapa genotypes five lost genes are related to flowering time in rapid cycling, covering all five categories of lowering time genes. in the other genomes just three genes are found, related only to photoperiod in turnip and vernalization in chiifu. evolutionary divergence chiifu, rapid cycling and turnip are estimated to have diverged <dig> years ago, far preceding domestication . this may seem to imply that prior to domestication there was already considerably divergence among b. rapa genomes; however, domestication can accelerate selection and hence influence divergence time estimates. we do not know whether there was already variation in appearance, such as enlarged hypocotyls, leaves that form heads, multi tillering types etc. prior to domestication, or whether there was a common wild type, and that breeders merely combined mutations and allelic variation by crossing which gave rise to diverse morphotypes. it is also unknown whether early plant breeders could breed for all different morphotypes starting from the same genetic materials, or that specific b. rapa materials resulted in certain morphotypes. resequencing more b. rapa genotypes belonging to turnip, leafy and oil types, especially from diverse geographical regions may shed light on these questions.the percentage of b.rapa genes that have orthologs in t. halophila is higher than the percentage with orthologs in a. thaliana. the divergence date of a. thaliana and b. rapa is estimated at <dig> mya, earlier than that of t. halophila and b. rapa at <dig> mya and earlier than the whole genome triplication event dated 5– <dig> mya, after speciation of a. thaliana/b. rapa and t. halophila/b. rapa <cit> . in other words, b. rapa genes are expected to be more similar to t. halophila genes than to a. thaliana genes. computational analysis as practical considerations make it hard to obtain the sequencing depth required for de novo genome assembly, in this work we took a hybrid approach in which we first mapped reads to a reference genome and then created new genomes by applying all variation found. the trade-off between the number of detected variants and mapping accuracy is important. a low mapping quality threshold setting leads to many candidate genes for further experimental validation, but can also introduce false positive discoveries. for the purposes of this study, we developed a number of scripts for variant calling, re-annotation and functional annotation that can help biologists to answer similar questions on genotype-phenotype relations. the re-annotation is a particulary time-consuming step, which may be extended by considering rna-seq data or available gene model gff and fasta files. CONCLUSIONS here we present two novel reference genomes and their annotations representing the morphotypes turnip and rapid cycling to the b. rapa community, which provides reliable templates for studying genetic variation between these two morphotypes and the reference, chiifu. in addition, this paper offers a complete workflow for those having limited computational resources and bioinformatics expertise studying similar biological questions. we investigated the resulting b. rapa pan-genome, paying specific attention to potential drivers of morphological variation. the number of genes with protein-coding changes among the three b. rapa genomes was lower than that among three diverse accessions of arabidopsis thaliana. we found peroxidases, mainly involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, enriched in the genes retained in turnip. analysis of the gene content of the b. rapa pan-genome revealed that the divergence date between the three morphotypes was dated long before domestication .",

mosaics and show variegated patterns of β-galactosidase reporter expression in all of their tissues <cit> . these mosaics have been widely used to study lineage relationships during development <cit> but they can also be used to analyse maintenance of adult tissues by stem cells <cit> . maintenance of the corneal epithelium by stem cells the corneal epithelium is an excellent model system for the study of tissue maintenance and repair because it is a discrete 5– <dig> cell thick epithelium replenished by a regionalised stem cell population, which is confined to the basal layer of the limbus at the periphery of the cornea <cit> . these limbal stem cells produce transient amplifying cells , which proliferate rapidly and migrate centripetally in the basal epithelial layer until their final division when both daughter cells move into the superficial layers, differentiate and are eventually lost from the epithelial surface by desquamation <cit> . previous studies with xlacz+/- mosaics from our group have shown that lscs become active after birth <cit> and identified possible genetic influences on lsc function <cit> . our previous mosaic analysis, suggesting that lscs become active after birth, was based on a transition from a pattern of patches to one of radial stripes. the sequence of events shown in fig. 1a–d proposes that some of the basal limbal epithelial cells are specified as lscs after the limbal epithelium has been determined. subsequently lscs become activated and the cornea is maintained by centripetal migration of tacs. thus, it is predicted that the initial mosaic pattern of patches is established during fetal and early postnatal development and the emergence of stripes indicates when stem cell function begins. stem cells are required to maintain tissues throughout life and the idea that stem cell function may decline with age and so contribute to age-related changes in tissue homeostasis is currently of great interest <cit> . however, this possibility has not yet been investigated systematically for lscs maintaining the corneal epithelium. wound healing in the corneal epithelium lscs are involved in wound healing, as well as normal tissue homeostasis, and they are up-regulated to replace the lost cells <cit> . corneal epithelial wound healing proceeds through three stages: an initial migratory stage to cover the wound with a cell monolayer, a proliferative stage to restore the epithelial thickness and a period of differentiation to restore the complex epithelial structure <cit> . several possible mechanisms could drive cell movement during the initial migratory stage, including population pressure of streams of cells moving centripetally from the limbus, population pressure from the wound-margin or other forces, such as chemotaxis or electric fields <cit> . cell proliferation is stimulated in the peripheral limbal epithelium and to a lesser extent in the corneal epithelium, within <dig> hours of wounding, to replace lost cells <cit> . however, proliferation at the wound margin may be suppressed to maintain tissue integrity <cit> . thus, many new cells will arise in the periphery and migrate centripetally, as in normal tissue homeostasis, to restore cell numbers and tissue morphology. the source of the cells and the extent of cell mixing during the early phase of wound healing can be investigated experimentally by a combination of mosaic analysis and organ culture. wound healing during 24-hour organ cultures reproduces the initial rapid movement of surrounding corneal epithelial cells to cover the exposed stroma but after 24-hours the experimental wound is only covered by a single layer of cells and the epithelium does not stratify during this initial ex vivo healing response <cit> . the alternative experimental approach of wounding cultured corneal epithelial cell monolayers is thought to cause a loss of spatial constraints and induce motility of sheets of epithelial cells rather than individual cells <cit> . however, this may not reflect the situation in vivo or in organ culture where wounding of a multi-layered stratified epithelium allows more scope for cell mixing during wound healing. this is because cells from the upper epithelial layers could contribute to the cell monolayer that forms during the initial movement phase. it has also been suggested that cells at the wound margin become less adhesive and may detach from the epithelial sheet <cit> , so promoting cell mixing. distributions of retrovirus-labelled skin epithelial cells during ex-vivo wound healing <cit> have been interpreted to suggest cell mixing is quite extensive <cit> but it has yet to be determined to what extent cell mixing also occurs during corneal epithelial wound healing. quantitative mosaic analysis of limbal stem cell function quantitative analysis of distributions of the two cell populations in mosaic tissues can provide more information than qualitative mosaic analysis <cit> but this has not yet been widely exploited. the striping patterns in the adult cornea are produced by lsc function and cell movement in the epithelium. lsc function can be compared in different experimental groups by quantitative analysis of stripe numbers. in an adult corneal epithelium, showing mosaic expression of a lacz transgene, the stripes of β-gal-positive cells are elongated patches formed from one or more β-gal-positive coherent clones whose descendents have migrated centripetally. a stripe spans the corneal radius, so its length is not affected by the number of lscs and is not relevant to the analysis. the stripe width, however, is variable and depends in part on the number of adjacent corneal epithelial coherent clones belonging to the same cell population . clearly, an individual stripe is more likely to be made up of multiple adjacent β-gal-positive corneal epithelial coherent clones when the proportion of β-gal-positive cells in the corneal epithelium is higher. this source of variation in stripe width can be factored out by dividing the observed mean width of β-gal-positive stripes by the function 1/, where p is the proportion of β-gal-positive cells around the circumference <cit> . the resultant 'corrected mean stripe width' can be used to derive a 'corrected stripe number' . this is proportional to the number of corneal epithelial coherent clones and can, therefore, be used to compare lsc function in different groups. a coherent clone of β-gal-positive limbal stem cells will produce a coherent clone of cells in the basal layer of the corneal epithelium that extends to the centre as cells move centripetally and extends to the suprabasal and outer epithelial layers as cells leave the basal layer. each corneal epithelial coherent clone is assumed to be formed from a single active coherent clone of lscs. thus, the number of active lsc coherent clones can be compared in different groups of mosaic eyes by comparing the corrected stripe numbers. although, the corrected stripe number is related to the number of active lsc coherent clones it does not provide a direct estimate of lsc numbers. this is partly because the proportion of lscs that are active may vary and also because the number of lscs per lsc coherent clone may vary. for example, variation in the number of lscs per lsc coherent clone may occur because of differences in the extent of cell mixing during development of the surface ectoderm, from which the corneal and limbal epithelia develop . aims the aims of this study were to better characterise lsc function and the streaming and mixing behaviour of the cells they produce during maintenance, repair and ageing of the mouse corneal epithelium. analysis of mosaic patterns in intact and wounded corneas demonstrated that lsc function declines with age, little cell mixing occurs either during normal maintenance of the corneal epithelium or during wound healing, the main driving force during wound closure is not population pressure from centripetally streaming cells produced by lscs and quantitative and temporal mosaic analyses provide new possibilities for studying stem cell function in tissue maintenance and repair. RESULTS qualitative characterisation of x-inactivation mosaic patterns in the corneal epithelium examination of mosaic corneal epithelia of 3– <dig> week old female xlacz+/- mosaic mice showed that the initial pattern of randomly orientated patches seen at <dig> weeks was replaced by radial stripes by postnatal week <dig> . this radial striped pattern was also present at all subsequent adult stages examined up to and including postnatal week <dig> . the transition from patches to stripes was gradual and not completed until after <dig> weeks , which is consistent with our earlier study <cit> . this presumably reflects activation of lscs between <dig> and <dig> weeks and the time required for subsequent replacement of the original mosaic patchwork pattern in both the basal and overlying suprabasal layers. the mature striping patterns did not extend outwards into the conjunctival epithelium , supporting earlier evidence that the conjunctiva is not maintained by lscs <cit> . occasional abnormal mosaic patterns may have been produced by wound healing . some β-gal-positive stripes were paler than normal and histological sections showed that these pale stripes were composed entirely of pale blue cells in all of the epithelial cell layers , implying that pale stripes were caused by reduced β-gal expression rather than overlapping, misaligned β-gal-positive and β-gal-negative layers. this suggests that the source of the variation is clonal, presumably reflecting an epigenetic change in the level of β-gal expression in lscs. in adult mosaic corneas, the stripes often met at a central whorl or met at a midline to form a more bilaterally symmetrical pattern . excluding eyes in which the pattern was unclear, <dig> % of <dig> eyes from mice aged 15– <dig> weeks had clockwise whorls, <dig> % had anticlockwise whorls, and <dig> % had midline patterns . the proportion of unclear patterns decreased from 50% at 15– <dig> weeks to <dig> % at 26– <dig> weeks, implying that midline, clockwise and anti-clockwise patterns become more clearly delineated and easier to resolve after <dig> weeks. the relative frequencies of clockwise and anticlockwise whorls were unaffected by age . for <dig> pairs of eyes with clear patterns, the clockwise anti-clockwise and midline patterns occurred independently in left and right eyes . wounds in mosaic corneal epithelia heal clonally in addition to xlacz+/- mosaics, the suitability of transgenic mice from lines y001deltadrr and y <dig> <cit> were evaluated for wound healing studies. these animals carry a yeast artificial chromosome containing the human pax <dig> locus <cit> into which a gfp reporter gene has been inserted at the pax <dig> atg start codon, placing it under the control of the pax <dig> regulatory elements. this also eliminates production of pax <dig> protein from the yac ensuring that wild type pax <dig> levels in these mice are unaffected. both lines demonstrated patterns of gfp-positive and gfp-negative radial corneal stripes qualitatively similar to those observed in xlacz+/- mosaics . the reason for the mosaic transgene expression is not clear but it probably involves stochastic transgene inactivation early in development so that only a proportion of adult limbal stem cells express gfp. line y <dig> contains a single copy of the yac with a 10– <dig> kb truncation, while line y <dig> contains six copies and in both cases tissue specific gfp expression patterns correspond to the endogenous pattern of pax <dig> expression <cit> . line y001deltadrr was produced by crossing y <dig> with the caggs-cre line <cit> resulting in germline deletion of the downstream regulatory region and leading to severely reduced gfp expression in the lens compared to line y <dig> <cit> . therefore, following initial evaluation, line y001deltadrr was used for the wound healing study because corneal stripes were clearer in eyes with weaker gfp expression in the lens. histological sections showed that the gfp-positive stripes were localised to the corneal epithelium not the stroma and were similar to the β-gal-positive stripes in the xlacz+/- mosaics . two approaches were used to study the dynamics of epithelial migration during ex-vivo wound healing more closely. first, the extent of cell mixing was monitored in xlacz+/- mosaic corneal epithelia following <dig> hours wound healing. <dig> mm diameter central wounds closed completely during this period . x-gal staining revealed that striping patterns extended from the edge of the wound to its centre with little lateral mixing between stripes . this provides the first demonstration that striping patterns in x-inactivation mosaic eyes are restored as a central wound heals in whole eye-organ culture, indicating that corneal epithelial wounds heal in a clonal manner with no significant lateral mixing between stripes. for the second approach, which we term 'temporal mosaic analysis', time-lapse confocal microscopy was used to follow wound healing in mosaic corneas of y001deltadrr transgenic reporter mice <cit> . using this approach, radial gfp stripes and the wound margins were clearly visible in both central and peripheral wounds throughout the healing period without the use of fluorescein . time-lapse recording of the radial gfp stripes allowed visualisation of the movement of gfp-positive cells towards the centre of wounds during the initial <dig> h of the wound healing response. gfp-positive stripes extended towards the centre of the previously wounded region and stripes remained contiguous throughout the wound healing response . while central wounds healed by centripetal movement of cells, healing of peripheral wounds involved both centripetal and centrifugal cell movement . this demonstration that cells can move centrifugally during wound-healing shows that population pressure from centripetally streaming cells produced by lscs at the periphery of the cornea is not the main driving force. during healing of central wounds it appears that the original stripe pattern is effectively restored, as cells move inwards from the wound edge to meet close to the original point of convergence, although there could be minor differences. in contrast, during healing of peripheral wounds the stripes form a second point of convergence so that the new pattern of stripes is quite different from the original . wounds in mosaic corneal epithelia sometimes heal asymmetrically the mean rate of migration calculated from the time taken for the wound shown in fig 6e–h to completely heal was <dig> μm min- <dig> however, tracking of individual stripes revealed that the wound actually closed asymmetrically . because image quality was relatively low and it was difficult to track some stripes, the total distance moved was calculated as the overall distance measured in a straight line between the first and last time points and as the aggregate of individual measurements between each time point . this demonstrated that stripes from different places around the wound extended at different rates and is confirmed by the variation in the mean rates of movement for the leading edge of each of the six stripes . using method a to measure the distance moved, the rates of movement varied from <dig> μm min- <dig> to <dig> μm min- <dig> for the <dig> different stripes measured. method b gave very similar results . to our knowledge this is the first report of differential rates of cell movement at the leading edge of a circular wound in the corneal epithelium and highlights the advantages of using a mosaic analysis. † in method a the distance each stripe moved was calculated from the total distance moved regardless of the route. †† in method b the distance each stripe moved during wound healing was calculated by measuring the distance moved between every time point. quantitative clonal analysis implies a reduction in the number of active lsc clones with age corrected stripe numbers were calculated for stripe patterns in <dig> adult xlacz+/- mosaic corneal epithelia and used to compare lsc function at different ages up to <dig> weeks and in different regions around the circumference. this showed that the corrected stripe number declined with age, up to but not beyond <dig> weeks . there was, however, no significant age-related change in the percentage of β-gal-positive cells in the corneal epithelium , reflecting the fact that x-inactivation is a single stable event in the early embryo. the decline in corrected stripe number implies there is an age-related decline in the number of active lsc clones and, therefore, an age-related decline in lsc function during this period. distribution of active lsc clones around the circumference several studies based on analysis of holoclones in humans <cit> and brdu label-retaining cells in mice <cit> suggest that limbal stem cells may be unevenly distributed around the limbal circumference. there is similar evidence that the proposed tac marker α9β <dig> integrin is unevenly expressed around the circumference of the corneal epithelium <cit> . therefore, we compared the distribution of corrected stripes in two pairs of overlapping regions, each representing half of the circumference of a subset of xlacz+/- mosaic eyes. this showed that there was no significant difference among the four regions in either percentage of β-gal-positive cells or the corrected stripe numbers . thus, our analysis showed no evidence for an uneven distribution of lsc clones around the limbal circumference. discussion this study has shown that once the lscs are activated, coherent streams of clonally related cells move centripetally from the limbus, with little lateral mixing, to maintain the corneal epithelium. during corneal wound healing similar coherent streams of cells move into the wound from the perimeter, again with little lateral mixing. however, the direction of movement is not always away from the limbus and cells at different places around the wound may move at different rates, causing asymmetrical healing. the mosaic patterns, produced by streams of cells migrating from the limbus during normal corneal maintenance, show both stochastic and age-related variation. importantly, analysis of these age-related changes implies that lsc function declines with age. cell streaming during maintenance and repair of the corneal epithelium normal corneal epithelial homeostasis has been described in terms of an xyz hypothesis <cit> . this involves production of corneal epithelial cells in the form of tacs from lscs, centripetal movement of tacs and differentiation and eventual loss of terminally differentiated cells by desquamation, such that x+y balances z. the emergence of stripes in the mosaic corneal epithelium at around <dig> weeks requires that stem cells are already specified and activated so the time that stripes first appear provides a guide to the time of stem cell activation. the time of emergence and subsequent maturation of stripes coincides with changes in the distribution of some markers associated with lscs and tacs between <dig> and <dig> weeks after birth <cit> , which may indicate the maturation of a lsc niche in the basal limbal epithelium. the streams of tacs leaving the limbus produce radial stripes that meet near the centre of the cornea and often form a clockwise or anticlockwise whorl. the whorls may reflect failure of centripetally migrating cells to meet precisely at the centre of the tissue or may be generated by a rotational force or chemotactic response, as described in other systems <cit> . age-related differences in the frequencies of striped patterns suggest that differences between midline, clockwise and anti-clockwise patterns become clearer after <dig> weeks. this is also when the decline in lsc function occurred but it is unclear whether these two observations are related. it is possible that the whorls become tighter and more clearly delineated with age but this has not yet been investigated. similarly, it is not yet known whether the whorling patterns are stable or dynamic, perhaps allowing stripes to change over time between clockwise and anticlockwise via mid-line or other interim patterns. the lack of association between the type of whorling pattern in left and right eyes from the same mouse suggests that the stripe patterns are produced stochastically in individual eyes. the stripes are produced by proliferation of β-gal positive and negative limbal stem cell clones, distributed around the corneal periphery, and centripetal movement of streams of cells but the differences will mostly be driven by unknown factors that cause the whorls. movement of corneal epithelial cells is more rapid during the early stages of wound healing than during normal corneal epithelial maintenance. migration rates in the range of <dig> – <dig> μm min- <dig> in response to wound healing in-vivo, ex-vivo and in-vitro have been reported <cit> and similar rapid rates of movement occurred during healing of our xlacz+/- and gfp mosaic corneas. this is approximately 40-fold faster than the estimates of 17– <dig> μm day- <dig> <cit> for cell movement in the unwounded mouse corneal epithelium during normal corneal maintenance. nevertheless, the rapid movement induced by removal of spatial constraints did not promote lateral cell mixing in the mosaic corneas and stripes remained contiguous despite the requirement for changes in cell-cell adhesion and remodelling of adhesion complexes necessary to close a wound . the fact that both xlacz+/- and pax6-gfp stripes remained contiguous during healing shows that wounds healed in a clonal manner, suggesting a coordinated tissue response to wound healing stimuli, without any significant cell mixing. this differs from interpretations of experiments on adult skin epithelial wound healing, suggesting quite extensive cell mixing <cit> and may reflect differences in the mechanism of wound closure. adult skin wounds heal by lamellipodial crawling whereas wound healing in the adult corneal epithelium may use lamellipodial crawling and/or a mechanism involving a 'purse string' of contractile actin cable linking cells at the leading edge and co-ordinating cell movement <cit> . however, it has been reported that the actin cable does not form during corneal wound healing in organ cultures <cit> so this 'purse string' mechanism may not explain why little or no cell mixing occurred during our xlacz+/- and pax6-gfp corneal wound healing experiments. the observation that during the healing of peripheral wounds cells can move centrifugally shows that the main driving force is not population pressure from cells produced by lscs so is likely to be population pressure from the wound-margin or other forces, such as chemotaxis or electric fields. peripheral wound healing in mosaic corneas produced a new pattern of stripes, which converged within the wound. as the original central region was not wounded the healing of peripheral wounds produced a second centre of stripe convergence. the resultant bi-convergent striping pattern resembles the abnormal striping patterns seen previously in some xlacz+/- mosaic eyes , suggesting that they may have been produced by previous wound healing events. use of time-lapse confocal microscopy for studies of wound healing allows rates of cell movement to be monitored throughout wound healing and provides a simple means of identifying the time of wound closure. the combination of time-lapse microscopy and mosaic analysis offers the additional advantage of being able to measure the rate of cell movement in different regions around the wound circumference. the observation that wounds may heal asymmetrically hints at mechanisms involved in inducing cell movement. it suggests that cells are unlikely to be pushed with equal force from all around the wound edge, so either the population pressure is unequal or cells are attracted to a specific region that need not coincide with the centre of the wound. for example, if the wound was not perfectly central and the converging streams of cells met at the centre of the cornea the migrating cells would probably not meet at the centre of the wound. the experimental system described here clearly offers opportunities to design further experiments to distinguish between alternative mechanisms that control the direction of corneal epithelial cell movement during normal maintenance and wound healing. distribution of limbal stem cell clones although previous reports suggest there is an uneven distribution of lscs and tacs around the circumference, no clear consensus has emerged. analysis of holoclones produced by human limbal cells suggested there were more colony forming cells in the superior and temporal than the inferior and nasal regions <cit> but this was based on a single eye. uneven distributions of brdu label-retaining cells in mice have been reported to be higher in the superior and inferior compared to nasal and temporal quadrants <cit> or higher in superior and temporal than inferior and nasal regions <cit> . in contrast, more cells expressing α9β <dig> integrin were reported in the nasal region of the corneal epithelium compared to temporal, superior, and inferior regions <cit> . our analysis did not provide any evidence for an uneven distribution of lsc clone numbers but this does not relate directly to the numbers of lscs. also, to reduce edge-effects, our analysis compared lsc clone numbers between two halves rather than four quadrants so would not detect all uneven distributions. for example, if there were more lsc clones in the superior and inferior than temporal and nasal regions they would be equally represented when comparing superior versus inferior and temporal versus nasal. reduction of limbal stem cell function with age our quantitative analysis implies that lsc function declines with age to <dig> weeks and then stabilises. an age-related decline could occur either if some lscs were lost or if some lscs become quiescent, resulting in a reduction in the number of active lsc clones . further work with suitable lsc markers, once they become available, is needed to determine whether there is a parallel decline in lsc numbers, similar to the observed decline in epidermal holoclones <cit> . alternatively, the influence of ageing might be less direct , as seen in some other stem cell systems . although the lsc function declines with age most stripes span the corneal radius at all ages suggesting that corneal epithelial cell migration is normal and sufficient cells are produced to maintain corneal homeostasis up to <dig> weeks of age. furthermore, our evidence for an age-related decline in lsc function prompts additional experimental questions concerning age-related changes in the limbal niche, lsc numbers, the balance between quiescent and active lsc states and the minimum number of active lscs required to maintain the corneal epithelium. CONCLUSIONS adult stem cell therapy, the holy grail of stem cell research, is already advanced for the treatment of some corneal conditions <cit> . however, understanding the cellular mechanisms underpinning these surgical interventions requires a better understanding of lsc function and corneal maintenance from well-characterised animal models as well as human tissues. in particular, tissue ageing and its implications for adult stem cells and their niches needs further study. here, analysis of age-related changes implies that lsc function declines with age. together with evidence from other systems, linking stem cell deterioration to the ageing process <cit> , this is likely to encourage investigations of how lscs and the limbal niche change with age.",

    "prompt": "Give a brief textual summary of the input content. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND staphylococcus aureus repeat elements are short gc rich direct repeats found in intergenic regions across the s. aureus genome <cit> . star elements consist of 14 bp direct repeats of the consensus sequence ttgttgggccc interspersed with at least 40 bp of recurring sequences <cit> . the function, origin and the mechanism by which star elements propagate throughout staphylococcal genomes is unknown. repetitive dna sequences are ubiquitous in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, and are highly diverse in their structure and function. while eukaryotic repeat elements often have no clear role within the cell, prokaryotic repeat elements tend to be functionally significant <cit> . these roles include transcriptional or translational phase variation of gene expression <cit> , modulation of mrna transcript stability <cit> and in the case of the well characterised crispr elements protecting the genome from invading foreign dna elements <cit> . currently no function has been described for star elements. repetitive elements can evolve rapidly over time. for simple sequence repeats, such as homopolymeric tracts, slip-strand mispairing during dna replication can result in a change in repeat number after a single generation. this is the basis of phase variable gene regulation, providing random switching of target genes between on and off states and resulting in bacterial subpopulations that are better adapted to environmental change <cit> . mutations in tandem repeats, resulting in changes in repeat number, occur 100– <dig> times more frequently than point mutations making repeat arrays hotspots for genomic plasticity <cit> . interspersed repeats can undergo homologous recombination, resulting in changes in repeat number and the spread of a repeat element throughout the genome <cit> . therefore genomic repeats are inherently unstable and can undergo dramatic changes over time, which may or may not be linked to their function. since their initial discovery over a decade ago there has been little published data regarding star elements, and much of what has been published has focused on their potential as variable number tandem repeats and their use in s. aureus strain typing <cit> . information regarding the abundance and conservation of these repeat elements throughout the staphylococcus genus stem from techniques such as southern blotting that do not provide resolution to the sequence level <cit> , and a study using comparative genomics which identified some copy number variation in a truncated star element between a select subset of s. aureus strains <cit> . current advances in genome sequencing have meant that there is now a wealth of available staphylococcal genome sequences, allowing us to study the structure and evolution of star elements in much finer detail. the purpose of this work was to analyse star elements at the molecular level from both a wide variety of s. aureus strains and in other staphylococcal species in order to further our understanding of the origin, propagation and maintenance of this repeat element. through the use of whole genome pattern searches we have extensively mapped the locations of star elements in 15 s. aureus genomes as well as <dig> staphylococcal species, alongside a more detailed look at individual star loci from a wider pool of s. aureus strains at the sequence level. the data show that star elements are associated with distinct flanking genes in each staphylococcal species, suggesting that they are maintained autonomously within each species, and that their positions within each genome are stable over time. furthermore s. aureus star elements are conserved at the sequence level within ancient evolutionary lineages. these features point towards an as yet unidentified function for these repeat elements. RESULTS star elements are significantly more abundant in both repeat number and genomic location in s. aureus and s. lugdunensis compared with other staphylococci although star elements have previously been shown to be much more abundant in s. aureus genomes than those of other staphylococcal species <cit> , the techniques employed only provided semi-quantitative data on the actual numbers of repeat motifs involved and did not give any indication of the exact number of elements present in each genome or into how many distinct loci these fall. the available s. aureus and staphylococcal genomes were probed in silico for the presence of the degenerate star repeat sequence tntgttgnggccc using the rsa genome-scale pattern-search tool . the above sequence was chosen to provide enough degeneracy to identify all “true” star elements conforming to the original description from cramton et al. <cit> , and as used in the mvla schemes <cit> while limiting the identification of spurious star elements. we hypothesised that the abundance of star elements in staphylococcal species other than s. aureus would vary depending on the relatedness of that species to s. aureus, with more closely related species containing similar numbers of elements. based on 16s rdna sequence comparison <cit> , s. aureus is most closely related to s. epidermidis, followed by s. haemolyticus, then s. lugdunensis, s. saprophyticus, s. pseudintermedius and finally s. carnosus. in each s. aureus strain examined, between <dig> and <dig> star motifs were found, occurring at <dig> to <dig> distinct locations in each genome . the number of motifs at a particular locus varied between strains; the majority of loci contain only a single repeat motif however some tracts contain as many as <dig> unexpectedly s. lugdunensis contains a similar abundance of star motifs to s. aureus, with <dig> identified at <dig> loci, while the more closely related s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus contain far fewer than s. aureus. s. epidermidis atcc <dig> contains <dig> motifs at <dig> different loci, while s. epidermidis rp62a contains <dig> motifs at <dig> different loci and s. haemolyticus contains <dig> star motifs each at individual loci. s. pseudintermedius, s. saprophyticus and s. carnosus are all devoid of star motifs. the prevalence of these repeats is not, therefore, correlated with the phylogenetic relationships of the species, suggesting that the high levels of star motifs found in s. aureus and s. lugdunensis are due to other selective or molecular forces. star element pattern searches were performed with an increased motif degeneracy of one additional substitution allowed throughout the sequence. although additional, weaker star motifs were identified in each species tested, the increase in motif number was proportional to the number of “true” elements present so that s. aureus and s. lugdunenesis still showed a higher prevalence of star motifs compared with other staphylococcal species . star elements locations are conserved within s. aureus, but not between different staphylococcal species in order to provide insight into the evolution of star elements as species and strains diverged over time, the conservation of the positions of star loci between and within staphylococcal genomes was determined. a total of <dig> potential star loci were identified for s. aureus, with each strain containing between <dig> and <dig> loci . strains from the same evolutionary lineage carry the same star loci, and therefore the star elements have not disseminated to new genome positions since the lineages diverged from one another. this indicates that the elements are stable within the s. aureus genome. the presence and number of star motifs at each potential star locus identified from each of the following s. aureus genomes: mssa <dig> mw <dig> mrsa <dig> rf <dig> jh <dig> jh <dig> ed <dig> , mu <dig> mu <dig> n <dig> col, nctc <dig> usa <dig> frp <dig> usa <dig> tch <dig> newman. * indicates only the upstream gene matches. ** indicates only the downstream gene matches. annotations for unknown genes are taken from mssa <dig> mrsa <dig> and rf <dig> full details of adjacent loci are available in table s <dig> . the s. aureus star reference set was then used to extend this analysis to the additional staphylococcal genomes, in order to determine whether the star elements are associated with particular genes across different species. homologues to several of the s. aureus flanking regions in the reference set were identified across the staphylococcal species, but none of these alignments contained star elements. reference sets for both s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus, were then used to determine star locus conservation between s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and s. lugdunensis. we did not find a single star associated genomic neighbourhood that was consistent between two species, although the star associated loci were conserved between the two s. epidermidis genomes studied. these data show that star elements have spread through and been maintained autonomously within each staphylococcal genome. the gapr star locus differs in structure between strains but contains consistent regions of sequence variability in order to determine how an individual star locus can alter as isolates diverge from one another, and therefore draw conclusions about how these repeat elements evolve over time, a single star locus was selected and analysed at the sequence level from a diverse pool of s. aureus strains. the star locus found upstream of the highly conserved s. aureus glycolytic operon, which is essential for glucose metabolism <cit> , was selected as this star locus showed high variability in the number of motifs between strains in our initial study. the intergenic region between gapr and the upstream open reading frame was sequenced from a total of 37 s. aureus isolates from a range of sources . the sequence of this region was also extracted from the <dig> sequenced s. aureus genomes described above, providing data for a total of 52 s. aureus strains. comparison of the dna sequence of the gapr star locus between s. aureus strains revealed a large amount of variability in this region, including differences in both repeat number and large scale structural changes . in the majority of strains the gapr star locus begins with a “start signature” sequence of gtgggacagaaatgat, which is slightly truncated compared to the sequence initially identified at the hprk star locus <cit> . this is followed by between <dig> and <dig> conserved star motifs interspersed with 40-44 bp of “spacer” sequence, which shows some variability between strains. between the star elements and the gapr coding region there is a 380 bp “semi-variable” region, which shares approximately 88% sequence identity between strains. this is classified as the group <dig> structure. in <dig> of the strains examined the entire star element locus is missing, as well as the first 39 bp of the 5' end of the semi-variable region . all of the group <dig> strains identified share 100% sequence identity across the sequenced region. an alternative deletion event appears to have resulted in the group <dig> structure , which retains the star start signature but shows no evidence of any star element repeat sequences . in addition, the first 70 bp of the semi-variable region in this group shares little similarity with the semi-variable region or the star element sequences identified in any other strains. the final two structural variants, groups 1b and 2b, appear to be derivatives of group <dig> and <dig> respectively. group 2b is missing the star elements having the same precise deletion site as group <dig> both group 1b and group 2b have an identical 77 bp insertion within the semi-variable region , whilst group 2b has a second 37 bp insertion 27 bp upstream of the star element deletion site . the 37 bp insertion seen in group 2b does not share any sequence similarity with the 77 bp insertion. star element structural groups <dig> and <dig> are restricted to specific evolutionary lineages multi locus sequence typing was used to investigate whether identify the different star element structural groups were associated with particular evolutionary lineages of s. aureus. st types were derived for each of the strains and then a phylogenetic tree was derived using the neighbour-joining algorithm based on the mlst profiles to determine the evolutionary relationships between these strains . these st-based phylogenetic trees indicated that the group <dig> and group <dig> strains, which do not contain star elements at the gapr locus, fall into distinct evolutionary lineages compared to the group <dig> strains . all of the group <dig> strains , which are 100% conserved across the gapr star locus, fall into clonal complex <dig> . as all of the cc <dig> strains examined in this study have a group <dig> structure, loss of star elements in these strains most probably occurred in a common ancestor and was maintained as the st’s diverged from one another. interestingly all of the group <dig> strains, which have a partial loss of the star element locus, belong to st <dig> . as the entire sequenced region is 100% conserved between the st <dig> strains, this again suggests that the deletion occurred early in the evolution of this sequence type and has been maintained in subsequent isolates. surprisingly the group 1b and group 2b strains, which contain the same unique sequence insertion, fall into distinct clonal complexes with very different allelic profiles; the group 1b strains are from st <dig> and the group 2b strains are from st <dig> and novel st a, which are both in cc <dig> although it initially appeared that the group 1b and group 2b structures were derived from group <dig> and group <dig> the phylogenetic data indicates that this is not a recent event. furthermore these structures did not occur due to a recent loss/gain of the star locus between groups 1b and 2b, as these strains are from different cc’s. taken together these data suggest that the gapr star locus differences occurred in very early lineages of s. aureus and have been maintained at a level equal to that of cc in subsequent strains. sequence variation of the star element spacers correlates with evolutionary lineage as the groups <dig> strains fall into a wide range of st’s and cc’s, it is clear that gapr star locus structure alone does not correlate with any particular lineage. however analysis of this star locus at the sequence level shows that the sequences of the “spacers”, which occur between star motifs, are strongly conserved within cc’s. for example, in strains from cc <dig> and cc <dig> the star spacer sequences are 100% identical between isolates even though the number of repeat motifs varies . interestingly the final spacer sequence is distinct from the internal spacers, but this “anchor” spacer is again 100% conserved between strains of the same lineage. in contrast, alignment of the spacers from strains originating from different lineages, even where they contain the same repeat number, detected high levels of variation in these sequences between distinct cc’s . we have confirmed the conservation of spacer sequences within a cc’s in all strains tested here, with the exception of the two strains representing cc <dig> the spacer sequences from the cc <dig> strains c <dig> and c <dig> are still highly conserved, but they are not 100% identical. this is further evidence that the structure and sequence of the gapr star locus is maintained within distinct evolutionary lineages. star spacer sequences are distinct at different loci within s. aureus strains but still correlate with lineage two additional star loci were analysed to further investigate the link between star element conservation and evolutionary lineage. the star loci found upstream of both the hprk gene, encoding a hpr kinase/phosphorylase, and a gene of unknown function sas <dig> referred to as orf <dig> in this study, were chosen as rsat analysis of these regions shows that they both contained variable numbers of star motifs and are preceded by a start signature. the star element regions upstream of hprk and orf <dig> were either pcr amplified and sequenced from a selection of s. aureus strains using primer pairs hprk f + hprk r and orf <dig> f + orf <dig> r respectively or extracted from the <dig> complete genome sequences. the strains were chosen to include at least <dig> examples, where possible, of strains from each lineage identified previously . interestingly both the hprk and orf <dig> star loci have some key structural differences to that of the gapr star locus. the star start signature sequence is present at both loci but occurs ~130 bp and 188 bp upstream of the first repeat motif at the hprk and orf <dig> loci respectively, compared to ~70 bp at the gapr star locus . furthermore there is no evidence for different structural variants in any of the strains examined as both the hprk and orf <dig> star elements only follow the group <dig> star element structure found at the gapr locus. there is also less variability in the number of star element repeat motifs at each of these loci, with the hprk locus ranging from 1– <dig> repeats and the orf <dig> locus ranging from 3– <dig> compared with the 1– <dig> repeats seen at the gapr locus. sequence analysis of the hprk and orf <dig> star spacers showed that sequence level variation in these repeat regions still strongly correlates with lineage as seen at the gapr locus. alignments of each individual locus clearly demonstrate high levels of conservation of the spacer sequences within strains from a particular lineage , as shown for cc <dig> . for strains containing multiple star repeats at locus orf <dig> we observed two distinct spacer types within the same locus in some strains, as seen in cc <dig> . however it is important to note that these sequences are still 100% conserved within each lineage and do not occur at either the hprk or gapr loci in any of the strains examined supporting the observation that the spacer sequences are distinct from one another and that there is no frequent transfer of motifs/spacers between the star loci. discussion in this study we have taken advantage of the wealth of fully annotated staphylococcal genomes to take a detailed look at star elements. to our knowledge this is the first in depth study of these interspersed repeats at the sequence level across multiple staphylococcal species, providing a unique insight into their evolution. star elements are highly abundant in s. aureus and yet we have shown that strain variation in the star element nucleotide sequences strongly correlates with their evolutionary lineage, as derived by mlst. this is unexpected as intergenic regions such as the star loci, which consist of repetitive elements dispersed throughout the genome, would be expected to show a high level of mutation and hence evolve at a higher rate than the conserved functional mlst loci where mutations are observed at a very low rate <cit> . these findings suggest star elements are functional and may be under strong purifying selection. star elements were sequenced from the gapr, hprk and orf <dig> loci from multiple s. aureus strains. in the majority of loci where multiple star repeats were present, the spacer sequences were often identical or differed by 1– <dig> nucleotides resulting in tandem repeats of ~ <dig> nucleotides. these repetitive sequences should be unstable and exhibit frequent alterations in repeat number due to slip-strand mispairing during dna replication. this process is likely to drive rapid alterations in repeat number, but not sequence, at many of these loci, as found with some other bacterial tandem repeats <cit> . congruent with this theory, strains belonging to the same st contain identical or highly conserved spacer sequences between the interspersed star motifs at a specific locus even when repeat numbers varied. this also suggests that localised expansion and contraction of the repeat region occurs even as the strains diverge from one another. in contrast, the spacer sequences are distinct at each star locus, even within a particular genome. due to the repetitive nature of star elements it has previously been suggested that homologous recombination between repeats occurs as a means of large scale genomic rearrangements <cit> , or could provide a simple means of propagating these repeats at different loci throughout the genome. as the spacers are distinct between unrelated strains and at different star loci within a strain, homologous recombination is unlikely to be occurring at a high frequency between star loci either intergenomically or intragenomically. either of these processes would result in gene conversion and the emergence of a dominant spacer sequence variant across multiple loci, a phenomenon we did not identify in this study. from the evidence presented here we suggest that the process of varying repeat number within a locus is limited to duplication or deletion of motifs from within that locus during dna replication or repair and is not due to recombination with elements present elsewhere in the genome. we also suggest that the mechanism for dispersal of the star elements to new positions throughout the s. aureus genome may not involve recombination as originally hypothesised. the gapr star locus was the least structurally stable of the three loci studied. the loss of the elements in the group <dig> and 2b structure occurs at the same “deletion” site and the surrounding dna is undisturbed compared to that of the group <dig> and 1b strains. this is similar to another class of interspersed bacterial repeats known as enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequences, which have been identified across the eubacterial kingdom <cit> . the sequence surrounding an inserted eric remains unchanged, indicating a precise insertion or deletion event via a mechanism distinct from classic transposition mechanisms <cit> . it is unclear whether a similar conserved mechanism is involved in the total loss or gain of star loci or whether the deletion site is merely acting as a hotspot for star element translocation. the partial loss of elements seen in strains such as rf <dig> does not occur at this deletion site, and may represent a different mechanism of repeat propagation or an error in repeat translocation in an ancestral strain that has been maintained in subsequent generations. there is no evidence of the total loss or gain of the gapr star locus in the recent evolution of s. aureus strains, as both the group <dig> and group <dig> isolates fall into distinct evolutionarily lineages. this strongly implies that the deletion process is infrequent and that the loss or gain of the gapr star locus may have occurred in early ancestors of these lineages and been retained in subsequent isolates. pourcel et al. observed a similar complex structure for the star elements in the sa <dig> locus with restriction of specific structural variants to certain lineages <cit> . these findings provide further evidence of the conservation of each of the star loci within a strain and lineage. our observed correlation between evolutionary lineage and both the structure of the gapr locus and the spacer sequences of the gapr, hprk and orf <dig> loci, suggests that star element loci retain lineage-specific phylogenetic information and may be utilised as major determinants of lineage in typing schemes. the genome wide mapping of star elements across the 15 s. aureus strains studied here identified <dig> loci that were present in every genome sequence and a further <dig> loci that were present in 85% of the genome sequences. the vast majority of these loci contain more than one repeat and exhibit variable repeat numbers , making them prime candidates for the development of future typing schemes. some star loci have already been utilised in typing schemes for s. aureus, first using an rflp typing method <cit> , and more recently as part of a greater multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis scheme alongside other variable-number tandem repeats and staphylococcal interspersed repeat units <cit> . the recent extended mlva scheme utilised six star element loci of which five were completely conserved in a collection of <dig> strains <cit> , although only four are present in up to 85% of the strains studied here. therefore our highly conserved loci should be examined for their potential value as markers of lineages. we have found that the star elements are not restricted to specific genomic neighbourhoods across staphylococcal species. this would suggest that the elements are not simply decaying from some early staphylococcus progenitor as this genus has diverged over time, but rather that each species has acquired star elements as independent events, which have then undergone proliferation to distinct locations in each genome. furthermore, star elements are maintained at a much higher level in the s. aureus and s. lugdunensis genomes compared to other staphylococcal species. the higher prevalence of these elements in s. aureus and s. lugdunensis may be due to the presence of a dispersal mechanism that is absent in the other species studied here, the absence of a mechanism to prevent spread of repetitive elements in these two species or strong selection for the function of these elements. the highly conserved nature of star elements within a cc suggests a functional role. unlike eukaryotic genomes which can contain more than 50% repetitive dna <cit> , prokaryotic genomes are streamlined as the propagation of non-functional “selfish” dna is a burden to the rapidly dividing organisms and selected against <cit> . other repeat elements in bacteria have functions in cell physiology, such as transcriptional control <cit> and protection of the microbial genome against foreign dna <cit> . a functional role for star elements is supported by evidence showing that some star elements are present in the leader regions of mrnas although the significance of this for gene expression has yet to be investigated further <cit> . alternatively, these repetitive sequences may have a general function in chromosome structure or stability, as seen with some eukaryotic repeat elements <cit> , which has led to their maintenance and spread within staphylococcal genomes. the star repeats are found associated with loci encoding virulence factors, metal transporters and several essential metabolic enzymes. the significance of the star repeats in the intergenic regions of these particular loci requires further investigation. interestingly, both s. aureus and s. lugdunensis tend to be much more pathogenic in humans compared to other staphylococcal species <cit> with s. lugdunensis n <dig> having several homologues of s. aureus virulence and colonisation factors that are not found in other staphylococcal species <cit> . our finding that star elements are present in higher levels in two of the more virulent staphylococcal species may indicate that the star elements play a role in pathogenesis. with the huge increase in the number of available genome sequences, the occurrence of star repeats in other bacterial species requires further investigation to confirm their existence and function outside of the staphylococcal genus. CONCLUSIONS star elements are highly conserved at the sequence level and are maintained at high levels in both s. aureus and s. lugdunensis, but not in the other staphylococcal species studied here. furthermore star elements are conserved at the sequence level within distinct evolutionary lineages but conversely exhibit localised expansion and contraction of repeats. this means that these repeat loci retain both ancient and more recent phylogenetic information, making them ideal candidates for strain typing schemes. the high level of conservation seen in these repeats suggests that star elements may, as with other bacterial repeats, have a functional role in cell physiology and confer fitness advantages on some or all s. aureus lineages.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the pathophysiology and key clinical markers. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND heterosis is a phenomenon that particular inbred lines can produce progenies with favourable phenotypes over their parents, such as stronger tolerance to stresses and higher yields. two fundamental hypotheses for heterosis were defined in classical genetic studies, including genome-wide dominance complementation and locus-specific over-dominant effects <cit> . evidence showed that both play roles in heterosis with involvement of epistasis <cit> . another theory suggested that heterosis might result from the loss of control of metabolism among heterozygotes <cit> . along with the development of genome-wide expression technology such as est, sage, and microarrays, current technological advancements allow scientists to gain comprehensive information and knowledge on gene expression profiles of particular tissues from hybrids and their parental lines <cit> . as it is obvious that differentially-expressed genes among hybrid triads may offer straightforward molecular clues to characterize phenotypic differences and genes responsible for favourable phenotypes, high-throughput gene expression profiling methods have been used for identifying degs in recent years. various degs and their expression patterns in hybrids and their parental lines have been defined and analyzed, including over-dominance, high-parent dominance, additivity, low-parent dominance, and under-dominance <cit> . the distribution of degs varies among different samples, which not only reflects the complexity of rice transcriptomes but also points to the possibility where intricate molecular mechanisms may be involved in heterosis. as both an important cereal crop and a model plant, the rice genome has been sequenced multiple times for its two major subspecies <cit> . we have been studying rice genome with a particular interest on the molecular mechanism of heterosis as one of the specific aims proposed for the super-hybrid rice genome project . the project focuses on an elite super-hybrid and its parental lines . several datasets of degs as potential heterosis-associated genes as well as possible molecular mechanisms have been collected from major tissues, such as leaves, roots, and panicles <cit> . the mature embryo is an important developmental stage in the rice life cycle, as it is a synchronized, undeveloped miniature plant that consists of precursor tissues for root, leaf, and stem. it was reported that its long-lived mrna reserved in dry plant seeds might, in general, contain a valuable molecular record of embryogenic development and primary biological process <cit> . a recent study suggested that the embryo of heterotic f <dig> possesses certain advantages at a very early developmental stage <cit> . therefore, it is important to know whether the mature embryo deposits heterotic potential for further development, as a genome-wide transcriptomic study for the mature rice embryo of a hybrid triad has not yet been reported to this date. in this study, we constructed cdna libraries for mature embryos from 93- <dig> pa64s and lyp <dig> and randomly sequenced approximately <dig> ests from each library, resulting in <dig> high-quality ests and <dig> unigenes. we analyzed these ests and identified <dig> degs between lyp <dig> and its parental lines . assigning the degs into functional categories and expression patterns, we realized that multiple modes are at work for heterosis. all our est sequences were submitted to the ncbi dbest database under accession number fg <dig> to fg <dig> RESULTS est acquisition we acquired approximately <dig> clones from each library, which yielded <dig> high-quality ests after removal of vector and low-quality sequences. the collection was further refined by removing sequences that are not anchored in the oryza sativa gene index database and predicted gene sequences of the 93- <dig> genome <cit> , resulted in <dig> high-quality ests that include <dig> , <dig> , and <dig> ests for 93- <dig> pa64s, and lyp <dig> respectively . we assembled the ests into <dig> clusters, including <dig> contigs and <dig> singletons. the three datasets contain <dig> <dig> and <dig> unigenes from 93- <dig> pa64s, and lyp <dig> respectively, with a similar cluster-size distribution . only <dig> unigenes were found universally-expressed as they are shared by all three libraries; there are about a third of them are shared by two libraries and more than 50% unigenes in each library are unique . since most of the unique genes were detected as single copies, we believe that the transcriptome of a mature rice embryo is rather complex and the current sampling is not deep enough to discover low-abundance genes as most of the genes should be shared among the cdna libraries rather than truly unique to each. therefore, we focused our analysis on unigenes expressed in relatively high abundance. functional annotation we annotated <dig> out of a total of <dig> unigenes in our dataset based on sequence similarity to those in public databases . among <dig> un-annotated unigenes, <dig> have significant similarity to the repeat sequence collection and one to a non-coding rna sequence from the mouse genome . the remaining <dig> unannotated unigenes are rather short but have open reading frames more than <dig> amino acids in length, and they may represent novel protein-coding genes or non-coding rnas as they are expressed in rice embryos. alignments were performed by using blast , and <dig> unigenes were annotated. we aligned the best hits to tigr ogi database with the gene index to go mapping database at tigr and assigned at least one go term to <dig> transcripts. the go-annotated unigenes are <dig> , <dig> , and <dig> for 93- <dig> pa64s, and lyp <dig> respectively. we assigned most of the unigenes into several functional categories, including cellular process, metabolism process, multicellular organism development, stress tolerance, transport, cell, binding, catalytic activity, transcription regulator activity, translation regulator activity, and transporter activity . we also annotated our datasets using kegg automatic annotation server for pathway information . we were able to offer <dig> unigenes ko numbers, including <dig> , <dig> , and <dig> in the libraries of 93- <dig> pa64s, and lyp <dig> respectively. the categories of metabolism, genetic information processing , environmental information processing , and cellular process involved <dig> %, <dig> %, <dig> %, and <dig> % of the total annotated unigenes, respectively. as summarized in figure <dig> carbon , energy , and amino acid metabolisms are major contributors among the subsets of metabolism. in the category of gip, translation and sorting are the majority as opposed to transcription . signal transduction and membrane transport constitute the majority of eip. other than these major categories, the rest of cellular processes showed lower abundance although defence systems were found more abundant among the low-abundance categories. expression abundance we calculated the expression abundance for each unigene using their cluster sizes and sorted them into three abundance levels: high-abundance , medium-abundance , and low-abundance . the top <dig> bins of high-abundance genes constitute only <dig> % of total unigenes in kind but <dig> % of the total est counts . the entire collection and its annotated details are listed in additional file 1: summary of unigenes. their sequences are supplemented in additional file 2: a full list of unigene sequences. alignments were performed by using blast , and <dig> unigenes were annotated. atranscript per million,b stress-tolerance associated genes, and c development-associated genes. to identify embryo-characteristic genes, we carried out a hierarchical clustering analysis based on est abundance, rice gene annotation in the unigene database at ncbi, and comparative analysis with representative libraries of other rice tissues selected from the digital differential display database . we also did a parallel analysis utilizing sage data of different tissues , which were generated from the same hybrid triad lines <cit> based on annotations in our database that contains predicted gene sequences from the 93- <dig> genome. the results are rather consistent; not only is there a significant amount of high-abundance genes unique to the mature embryo but also most of the medium-abundance genes are rather characteristic for the embryo . in addition, we compared embryo-associated genes against all predicted genes from the parental genomes based on go functional classification, and observed the enrichment of genes in several categories, such as response to stimulus and stress in the category biological processes . data from this study are highlighted in bold and italic. based on go functional classification, we found that high-abundance genes are enriched in cellular and metabolic processes, response to stress, cell, binding, catalytic activity, and translation regulator activity; medium-abundance genes are those for embryo development, response to external stimulus, transport, enzyme regulator activity, signal transducer activity, structural molecule activity, transcription regulator activity, and transporter activity; and low-abundance genes are involved in anatomical structure morphogenesis, death, growth, reproduction, response to biotic stimulus, and motor activity . we also analyzed the genes classified as different pathways. we found that high-abundance genes concentrate on carbohydrate metabolism, folding/sorting/degradation, membrane transport, signal transduction, and defence systems, and medium-abundance genes are mainly involved in the pathways of energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, transcription and translation . high-abundance genes were found in the pathways of glycolysis, pores ion channels, protein folding and associated processing, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, mapk signalling, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and antigen processing/presentation; all appear performing important functions in keeping embryonic status and rapid growth recovery. abundant embryo-characteristic gene families we discovered four major gene families expressed in high-abundance in the rice embryo . the most abundant gene family belongs to cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases, making up 10% of total ests. they are universally-expressed and senescence-associated in all eukaryotic species. among plants, these enzymes are important for the biosynthesis of hormones, defensive compounds, and fatty acids. the second group is composed of hsps , and they are multifunctional molecular chaperones and many show over-expression during embryonic development and are inducible by desiccation and other stress types. we identified four low-molecular-weight hsps in our dataset; they are hsp <dig> , hsp <dig> , hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> as well as four classical hsps: hsp <dig> hsp <dig> hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> in numbers, there are 16% of the abundantly-expressed genes and <dig> % of the total ests belonging to the hsp family. the third protein family is the lea proteins that are a group of proteins accumulating in high abundance during last stages of seed formation and periods of the water shortage in vegetative organs. ample evidence bsuggested that lea proteins, especially its subgroup <dig> members, are involved in desiccation resistance through a variety of machineries, including water retention, ion sequestration, and direct protein protection <cit> . the fourth group is the rab family, which are membrane-associated small gtp-binding proteins localized to discrete subcellular compartments and involved in signal transduction, cytoskeleton organization, and vesicle trafficking. they are also stress-inducible. we identified its four members whose ests make up <dig> % of the total collection: rab <dig> , rab <dig> rab <dig> and rab <dig> acytochrome p <dig> family, bheat shock protein, clate embryogenesis abundant protein, and d rab protein. degs between lyp <dig> and its parents based on p-values of <dig> and <dig> from general chi-squared test, we defined <dig> and <dig> degs, respectively, between lyp <dig> and its parental lines . the full list of all degs is in additional file 4: degs and their expression patterns. most of these degs belong to high- and medium-abundance genes, <dig> % and <dig> %, respectively. we focus our discussion on the larger group unless specified. the degs cover almost all expression patterns with rather unequal distributions. first, the majority of degs exhibit either high- or low-parent dominances rather than deviate significantly from both . second, of the <dig> genes, <dig> % show differences between pa64s and lyp <dig> whereas only <dig> % exhibit differences between 93- <dig> and lyp <dig> this result indicated that the gene expression pattern of lyp <dig> is more similar to 93- <dig> than to pa64s at this developmental stage. third, there are slightly less high-parent dominant genes than low-parent dominant ones in embryo both between 93- <dig> and lyp <dig> and between pa64s and lyp <dig> , whereas over-dominant genes are more than under-dominant genes . finally, there are slightly more up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes in general. when we used the more stringent p-value , most of the observed rules did not change except that the up-regulated genes between pa64s and lyp <dig> were found slightly more than down-regulated genes . in general, the distribution pattern of degs in the embryo is similar to that of the panicle as compared to our previous sage study <cit> . when we displayed the fold change of degs /2]) in a two-dimensional plot , the consistency remains. n, p, and l stand for paternal lines , maternal lines , and f <dig> hybrids , respectively. integrated analysis with proteomic and sage data we compared our degs to those identified from proteomic data generated from the same material . the proteomic data were acquired from the same material as what we used in this study, mature embryo of 93- <dig> pa64s, and lyp <dig> over <dig> 2-d gel spots were analyzed and <dig> differentially-expressed proteins were identified in the study. we found that most of the high-abundance genes also highly expressed in the proteomic data, but the expression patterns were not always consistent. there were only nine genes found consistent in both datasets, and three of them were not . seven of the consistent degs were found expressed higher in lyp <dig> except early embryogenesis protein and glutelin; both are down-regulated. most of the degs in the protein data fell into three general categories: additivity, over-dominance, and under-dominance, whereas most of the degs generated from the est data are in other groups: high- and low-parent dominance. we also compared our est data to those of our sage experiments generated from the same hybrid triad. the sage data were generated from nine sage libraries made from three tissues: root, leaf, and panicle of the same hybrid triad, 93- <dig> pa64s, and lyp <dig> roughly ten-thousand sage tags from each library were obtained and <dig> unique tags were annotated, and among them, <dig> degs were detected <cit> . in this study, we identified <dig> degs between the two datasets, which are shared by at least one tissue . the expression patterns in both dataset were summarized in additional file 5: degs shared with sage data. these genes are more likely to be associated with heterosis, especially when some of the degs have consistent expression pattern in all tissues. alignments of degs to genome sequences to understand the regulatory mechanism of degs, we traced their genomic sequences in 93- <dig> and pa64s, and identified the regulatory and transcript sequences among orthologous gene pairs. we scrutinized the genomic sequences from the genome sequences of 93- <dig> and pa64s for the <dig> degs that are confirmed with our sage data. we found that <dig> genes have almost identical sequences in all regions , and we believed that these genes might be regulated by distant trans-regulatory mechanisms other than cis-elements in their immediate promoters. among the <dig> genes that showed significant sequence deviations, <dig> , <dig> , and <dig> genes have differences in coding, 5'utr, and 3' utr regions, respectively. we also analyzed well-defined regulatory sequence motifs and found that <dig> genes have obvious motif variations. our results were summarized in table <dig> n stands for insignificant differences and y stands for significant differences . quantitative pcr-based experimental validation of degs we chose eight stress-tolerance-associated and four development-associated genes–both expressed in high-abundance and functionally important to mature rice embryo–to validate their expression patterns, using quantitative real-time pcr or qrt-pcr. the stress-tolerance-associated proteins are lea <dig> hsp <dig> , hsp <dig> tonoplast intrinsic protein, ubiquitin e <dig> thaumatin-like protein, bowman-birk trypsin inhibitor, and cold-regulated protein . the four development-associated genes included one embryo-specific protein and three metabolism-associated proteins . almost all the results showed consistent trends with their corresponding est data . we listed the primer sequences used in the experiment in additional file 6: primers for qrt-pcr. discussion genes in abundance: stress tolerance and development high-abundance genes are known to characterize tissue- or organ-specificity since they are dominant in manifestation of major functions of the tissue or organ. we found that the embryo shares <dig> , <dig> , and <dig> genes with leaf, panicle, and root, respectively, and there are <dig> genes common to all tissues. all high-abundance and most medium-abundance genes in our dataset are either specifically expressed or unique to their tissues of origin whereas only <dig> genes in medium-abundance expressed universally at similar expression level, as compared to the sage data, distributing among the most basic go categories . in an attempt to define functional characteristics of the mature rice embryo based on its high- and medium-abundance genes, we found that two major functional categories stood out: stress tolerance and development, which are composed of <dig> % and <dig> % of high-abundance genes, respectively. furthermore, there are still large amount of genes in the universally expressed categories such as metabolism and cellular process which expressed specifically in high-abundance in mature embryo. we identified a large number of genes that are in the category of anti-stress via various mechanisms, which include a complete water-deficit tolerance system and genes involved in resistance in oxidation damage and fungal pathogen infection . water deficit is a major threatening factor to embryos, and a water-deficit tolerance system in plants was reported, including membrane proteins, chaperones , water channel proteins, protease inhibitors, proteases, and the ubiqutin system <cit> . the three high-abundance gene families that we categorized in this study all have important functions in this system <cit> . our proteomic study with the same material also provided a footnote to this conclusion . three gene families–em, ec, and germin proteins–have been suggested to regulate the development of rice embryo to seedling <cit> . the em and ec proteins are encoded by conserved mrnas stored in mature embryos but germin transcribes after growth recovery. the em protein is involved in the process of seed desiccation, and the ec protein is the only bona fide zn metallothionein yet found in higher plants <cit> ; both may play important roles in ion homeostasis during embryogenesis since em and ec proteins are expressed as the most abundantly expressed genes in our dataset with <dig> and <dig> ests, respectively. in addition, we identified one embryogenic cell protein <dig> in the high-abundance gene class as well as other development-associated proteins including embryo-specific protein, differentiation embryo protein <dig> and early embryogenesis protein in medium-abundance genes. pathway analysis on the mrna repertoire provided a better glance on the basic physiology of rice mature embryos detected by pathway analysis, which showed that the embryo is well-prepared for rapid development. first, genes in the pathways of metabolism, especially the subsets of carbon, energy, and amino acid metabolisms, are stored in high abundance. material utilization and energy production, such as glycolysis , tca cycle, starch and sucrose metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and carbon fixation are of essence for the embryo. second, genes participating in translation and sorting are in high abundance to ensure rapid translation of the reserved rna. third, in the category of eip, signal transduction and membrane transport stood out obviously to guarantee rapid signal transduction in the recovery phase, especially the mapk signal pathway that is important in regulating cell cycle. fourth, the defence system is the highly-expressed gene category in our dataset for cellular processes, which ensures hormonal regulation in development and protection. our detailed analyses indicated that several important pathways active in mature plant tissues are almost absent in embryos. for example, we only identified nine ests involved in photosynthesis and none involved in respiration from our dataset. although present at low level, transcription and replication/repair genes are important for growth recovery as compared to the complete absence of genes in the categories of signal molecules and interaction as well as the low level of cellular process genes in our dataset. the reservoir of the reserved mrnas in the mature embryo appeared well-prepared for basic metabolism, response to environmental stimulus, and signal transduction to ensure rapid recovery. in the contrary, secondary metabolism, cellular process, and transcription constitute a relatively small portion of the total, and most of these functions must depend upon new mrna syntheses. possible biological mechanisms of heterosis when displaying all degs into two-dimension space, we found a composite expression pattern that suggests multiple modes of action as they are classified into <dig> patterns: over-dominance, high-parent dominance, additivity, low-parent dominance and under-dominance . although up- and down-regulated degs are almost equal in numbers , up-regulated genes are dominant in the most abundant gene classes including cellular, metabolic, response to stress, embryo development, enzyme regulator activity, transcription regulator activity, and transporter activity . strengthened stress-tolerance system in f1 the majority of stress-tolerance genes in our dataset exhibited differential expressions among the hybrid triad, and especially showed up-regulated expressions in lyp <dig> . in the go term, five out of seven degs are in the category of response to stress and up-regulated in f <dig> in the gene families related to stress tolerance , <dig> % were differentially expressed whereas 89% of them are up-regulated together with <dig> % down-regulated and <dig> % additivity in f <dig> and as shown in table <dig> among 65% of the degs, 77% of them are up-regulated as opposed to 23% down-regulated . functionally, stress-tolerance genes are classified into two groups: protective and injury-induced genes. taking the water-deficit-tolerance related genes as examples, we know that protective genes, including chaperones , protease inhibitors, water-deficit induced membrane proteins, and water channel proteins, are counterparts of the protein-degrading mechanism, promoting survivability under water-deficit conditions. injury-induced genes include proteases and ubiquitin system, which are involved in the degradation of proteins that are denatured during cellular water loss . in lyp <dig> most of the protective genes are up-regulated as compared to the down-regulated injury-induced genes. protective genes that participate in other stress-related functions are also up-regulated in the f <dig> proteomic data also added footnotes to this notion, where the most functionally important and representative genes, including lea <dig> shsp, bowman-birk trypsin inhibitor, lipoprotein and lectin, thaumatin-like protein were found as up-regulated degs. in addition, our sage data also pointed out a universal strengthening in the ability of stress-tolerance in the f <dig> where heavy metal transport/detoxification protein, senescence-associated protein and rab <dig> protein were found up-regulated albeit in other tissues of lyp <dig> we validated some of these results with qrt-pcr. better preparation for growth recovery deg analysis suggested that the f <dig> appears better prepared for growth recovery as compared to its parental lines. first, genes participating in material and energy utilization are up-regulated and genes participating in anabolism are down-regulated . in general, the up-regulated degs were found in carbon metabolism with an exception of the oxidative phosphorylation of a nadp-dependent malic enzyme in energy metabolism. in contrast, genes in carbon, nitrogen fixation, and nucleotide metabolism are mostly down-regulated. in amino acid metabolism, we identified genes both up-regulated and down-regulated, but all genes related to amino acid biosynthesis are down-regulated. this indicated that lyp <dig> up-regulate material and energy generation and utilization to ensure its embryo to be active immediately when being re-hydrated as material anabolism is normally down-regulated. second, in the category of gip, genes involved in protein folding and associated processing are up-regulated and genes of ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and proteasome are down-regulated. genes involved in transcription are down-regulated but those involved in translation are not obviously biased, where both down- and up-regulated genes were found. third, in eip, genes in membrane transport and mapk signal transduction are up-regulated but calcium signalling pathway and phosphatidylinositol signalling systems are down-regulated; the result suggested that mapk signalling pathway may be the major signal pathway triggered as development starts after re-hydration. finally, degs involved in cellular process but not in the response system appeared down-regulated. some of these genes and their trends of expressions were found consistent in our sage and proteomic data. for example, the up-regulation of an important enolase was confirmed in the protein data. and the up-regulation of succinate dehydrogenase was validated based on the qrt-pcr test. another instance is β-amylase that is a key enzyme for starch hydrolysis, which is not only found up-regulated in the embryo but also in the leaf and panicle of lyp <dig> complementation and over-dominance we found that embryo-characteristic genes among degs are primarily up-regulated and showed high-parent dominance with the addition of over-dominance . the high-parent dominance genes often occur in gene families. for example, in the hsp family, the expression of lmw hsps has the tendency of pa64s, higher than that of 93- <dig> or expressed in an over-dominance fashion. in contrast, the expression level of classical hsps resembles that of 93- <dig> which is higher than that of pa64s, exhibiting over-dominance. in the lea and rab family, as well as other stress-tolerance genes, all the degs show high-parent dominance with expression levels similar to 93- <dig> more than two third of the degs differ between pa64s and lyp <dig> , whereas less than one third show differences between 93- <dig> and lyp <dig> . the result is consistent with the fact that lyp <dig> is more like 93- <dig> than pa64s in their phenotypic appearances . therefore, it appears that the hybrid vigour of lyp <dig> may be contributed by a composite of beneficial alleles from both parents, complementing the relatively weaker alleles in a global fashion, and over-dominance is an essential strategy for stress tolerance and metabolism. strengthening tissue-characteristic functions may contribute to heterosis analyses on degs have indicated that the mode of action for heterosis is most likely multi-fold and at multiple levels. if we have to point out a single mode of action, we believe that the strengthening of embryo-characteristic genes in lyp <dig> is most noticeable. for instance, the f <dig> lyp <dig> is predicted to have a significantly better stress-tolerance system than its parental cultivars, supported by up-regulated protective genes and down-regulated injury-induced genes. in addition, lyp <dig> keeps strong responses to environmental signals and potentially high-level activities after growth recovery. therefore, when seeds re-hydrate, the f <dig> embryo may perform better than its parental lines. this phenomenon can be cautiously generalized based on similar analyses among other tissues of the same hybrid line. for example, in leaf, it was detected that up-regulated genes in hybrid are dominated by degs related to enhancing carbon assimilation whereas those related to decomposition of carbohydrates are down-regulated <cit> , resulting in an increased efficiency of photosynthesis or energy production. CONCLUSIONS we reported a comparative transcriptomic analysis based on ests acquired from mature embryos of a rice hybrid and its parental lines. our study not only provided an initial characteristic description of expression profiles of rice embryos but also pointed out the enrichment of genes involved in stress-tolerance and preparation-for-recover . we also identified <dig> degs between f <dig> and its parental lines. functional analyses revealed clues for rice heterosis, such as multiple modes of actions and strengthening of embryo-characteristic function. genes involved in stress-tolerance and preparation-for-recovery may play key roles for rice heterosis in mature embryos.",

different predefined classes of samples. in a two-color microarray system both rna samples are separately labeled with different colors, mixed, and hybridized together to an array. the ratio of the two-color signal intensities for each spot represents a relative measure of gene expression. there are different types of design of two-color microarrays for identifying differentially expressed genes, such as the reference design , balanced block design, and loop design <cit> . two-color microarray data analysis generally consists of two stages. in the first stage, microarray data are filtered and normalized, e.g. adjusted for some of the systematic and technical variation that affects the measured gene expression levels. there are different methods to correct microarray data for systematic and technical variation <cit> . in the second stage of microarray data analysis, statistical methods are used to identify the genes that are differentially expressed between the different classes of samples. most of these statistical methods use similar basic statistics and differ mainly in their determination of the significance threshold. therefore, when applied to microarray data they give very similar overall results <cit> . factor analysis can be applied as a data-reduction-tool without any a-priori assumption regarding associations between observed data and latent structure . for this purpose fa has been widely applied in microarray studies <cit> . a disadvantage of efa is that the representation of data in a reduced set of dimensions can be difficult to interpret. on forehand the interpretation of the extracted factors is not fixed and biological contrasts do not necessarily coincide with single dimensions. yet, fa could be very well used for gene selection when it is applied as an instrument to confirm what is expected on the basis of pre-established hypothesis <cit> . when two-color microarray experiments are designed such that a hypothesis can be defined a-priori regarding the latent structure among the observed two-color microarray data, biologically relevant factors can be easily identified from which genes can be selected . in this paper we will illustrate cfa as a powerful statistical tool to analyze dna microarray data. as a model a microarray study is used in which the differences in gene expression related to cisplatin resistance are measured, using two-color microarrays, for four ovarian cancer cell lines , which only differ in their degree of cisplatin resistance. a <dig> the parental cell line, is cisplatin sensitive and its sublines cp <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> are increasingly resistant to cisplatin . background methodology confirmatory factor analysis the fundamental idea underlying the factor analytic models is that not all causative variables can be directly observed. these unobserved variables are referred to as latent structure of factors. information about factors can be obtained by inspecting how the factor elements are formed from linear combinations of the observed variables. in an efa, there is no specified structure of the relationships among the variables under study. in a confirmatory factor analysis the retrieved factors should reflect contrasts that correspond to differences in sample characteristics. there are a-priori defined constraints on the relationships among the latent factors and the variables under study. it is in this sense that the fa is thought of as confirmatory. in the here illustrated model, differences in gene expression between four ovarian cancer cell lines are related to their degree of the cisplatin resistance. the level of cisplatin resistance can be considered as the latent factor among the observed gene expression data. the latent factors, referred to as ξ, are depicted as a circle at the top of figure <dig> the ξ is imperfectly measured by a number of observed variables, e.g. two-color microarrays. while it is assumed that the number of observed variables in x is greater than the number of latent factors in ξ, there is no a-priori assumption about the exact number of latent factors. in our example, seven two-color microarrays are used, referred to as x <dig> to x <dig> and they are indicated by the squares in figure <dig> the measurement errors in the observed variables, referred to as δx <dig> to δx <dig> are depicted as circles at the bottom of the figure <dig> x <dig> to x <dig> are said to be effected by or load on ξ, the level of cisplatin resistance. the loadings, referred to as λx <dig> to λx <dig> are indicated by the arrows connecting the latent factor to the observed variables. in a microarray experiment there are i = <dig> ..., n performed arrays and j = <dig> ..., p probed genes. typically, j is in the order of thousands, while i is in the order of 10– <dig> the gene expression measurements of the microarray experiment are represented by a matrix x = of dimension n × p, with arrays as columns and genes as rows. each element xij corresponds to the gene expression measurement for the jth gene of the ith array. the expression level xij of each gene can be reconstructed by the standard linear equation

this means that the observed expression for the jth gene of the ith array is the sum of its activities in each of s latent factors , denoted by ξsj, weighted by the activity of this latent factor in array i, denoted by λsi, plus some array-specific noise δsi. this can be represented in matrix format as: x = Λξ + δ where Λ is the p × p matrix of factor loadings and ξ is the n × p matrix of factor scores and δ is the matrix of residuals as result of dimension reduction. by subtracting the mean from both the observed and latent variables it is possible to define the covariance matrix of a vector of variables in terms of expectations of vector products. in addition, it is assumed that the latent factors are uncorrelated . for that, in the here-illustrated example, we applied the method of singular value decomposition , the equivalent of principal components analysis. this method assumes that the extracted factors are uncorrelated and orders the factors according to percentage explained variation . the number of extracted factors can maximally be equal to the total number of arrays. the confirmatory factor model is identified if the constraints have been imposed in such a way that there is a unique set of parameters that can generate the covariance structure. more specific, if a parameter can be solved for in terms of the variances and covariances of the observed variable, it is identified. the constraint that retrieved factors have to be orthogonal is applied as some patterns underlying the microarray data are expected to be correlated with biological processes and others with experimental artifacts. after identification has been established, estimation can start. the objective in estimating the factor model is to find estimates of the latent factors and errors that reproduce the sample matrix of covariances as closely as possible. the fitting function used in the here-illustrated example, is the unweighted linear least squares . the problem of scale dependency was solved by performing the analyses on the correlation structure instead of the covariance structure. hybridization design the hybridization design of the micro-arrays was as follows: - the design was balanced: the four ovarian cancer cell lines were hybridized to the microarrays according to a reference design, indicating that all samples were hybridized against the cisplatin sensitive cell line a <dig> . the microarray data were expressed as cy5/cy <dig> ratios for each spot. - the design included a 'selfself' hybridization, x <dig> in figure <dig> note that all observed microarray data were expected to load on the latent factor ξ, except for x <dig> . this is because there should be no biological difference between the two-color signal intensities of 'selfself' experiments and therefore the 'selfself' hybridization was assumed not to load on the latent factor. - the design included dye swaps, x <dig> and x <dig> x <dig> and x <dig> x <dig> and x <dig> in figure <dig> cp <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> were labeled with cy <dig> and hybridized against cy3-labeled a <dig> x <dig> x <dig> and x <dig> in figure <dig> respectively. then the dyes were swapped: cp <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> were labeled with cy <dig> and hybridized against cy5-labeled a <dig> x <dig> x <dig> and x <dig> respectively. the sign of the loadings of x <dig> x <dig> and x <dig> were assumed to be opposite to the signs of the loadings of x <dig> x <dig> and x <dig> as these were the dye swaps. the magnitude of the loadings of x <dig> and x <dig> x <dig> and x <dig> x <dig> and x <dig> were assumed to be similar, as the same ovarian cancer cell lines were hybridized to these arrays. once the latent factors had been identified using their correlation structure with the observed variables, differences in level of cisplatin resistance would appear as contrasts between similar arrays after correction for dye swaps. - the design was performed in triplicate with three independent cultures of the cell lines. it was expected that replicate arrays, e.g. the two replicates of x <dig> to x <dig> would show the same loadings. analysis first the observed variables were standardized, i.e. fa was separately applied to the cy <dig> and cy <dig> microarray data to subtract the variation all arrays had in common. the first factor explaining the largest part of the variation, could be considered as variation the arrays have in common <cit> . this factor could be used for array quality control, as it would have lower or distinctly different correlations with arrays of lesser quality. in addition, plotting the standardized cy <dig> signal intensities against the standardized cy <dig> signal intensities, allowed us to test whether the hybridizations were non-competitive <cit> . however, from a mathematical point of view there is no objection to directly subjecting cy5/cy <dig> ratios to fa. in the second step, cfa was performed to uncover which of the factors coincided with differences in levels of cisplatin resistance between the four ovarian cancer cell lines and to select the genes with the highest loadings on those factors. it was assumed that a random process leading to non-normal distributions would likely affect all extracted factors to an equal degree. therefore, it was assumed that the statistical distribution of the gene expression data under the null hypothesis could be estimated from the factors that most likely represent noise. because we expected that the biological factors would result in genes with more extreme scores than those present in the non-biological factors we performed the analysis on scores with equal rank. first, the elements of each retained factor were rank-ordered and normalized to a mean of zero and to a standard deviation of one. then the elements with the same rank for each of the factors representing noise were averaged and renormalized. because the distribution affected by biological effects has more weight in the tails of the distribution, the elements with the most extreme scores will be larger in absolute value than the elements with the same rank from the rank averaged factors. subsequently, the genes with the same rank with the largest difference values from the averaged distribution were selected. this happened to result in selecting the genes with the most extreme scores. the threshold below or above genes were selected was used to obtain a false discovery rate by observing how many elements of the rank averaged factors were below or above this threshold. for a script of the applied method, the corresponding author can be contacted. RESULTS first step of the fa procedure: standardization of the cy <dig> and cy <dig> data the first factors from the cy <dig> and cy <dig> data explained 85% of the total variation and represented variation common to all arrays. figure <dig> shows that the correlations between the cy <dig> and cy <dig> data of each array and the first factor were highly similar. this figure also indicates that the quality of the arrays was very comparable. by subtracting this common variation from the cy <dig> and cy <dig> data all gene specific variation that does not contribute to differences between arrays was eliminated . after elimination of the common variation, the standardized cy <dig> and cy <dig> signal intensities of all arrays combined showed a positive correlation . when cy <dig> signal intensities in a specific array were lower than average, also cy <dig> signal intensities were lower than average, and reversely, implying that the hybridizations were non-competitive. the phenomenon of non-competitive hybridization as seen in our cdna microarrays was recently also described for long-oligonucleotide microarrays by 't hoen and colleagues <cit> . second step of the fa procedure: identification of the biologically relevant factors in the second step, the factors representing differences in cisplatin resistance between the four ovarian cancer cell lines were identified. we identified two factors of which the correlation structures with the observed variables, e.g. arrays, reflected the balanced reference design . the first factor explained a considerable part of the remaining variation between arrays . the first factor did not correlate with the 'selfself' hybridizations. furthermore, the sign of the loading of dye swap experiments on the first factor was opposite and replicate experiments showed the same loading . after the sign of the dye swaps was changed, all the arrays showed similar loadings on the first factor. thus, this factor reflected the contrast between a <dig> and cp <dig> + c <dig> + c <dig> the microarray data of the more resistant ovarian cancer cell lines c <dig> and c <dig> had a consistently higher loading on this factor than the data of the less resistant cell line cp <dig> the second factor was only associated with a minor amount of variance , but its correlation structure with the arrays reflected 'selfself' hybridizations, dye swaps and replicate experiments. after correction for dye swaps, this factor could be interpreted as a contrast between cp <dig> and c <dig> + c <dig> , as the sign of the loading of the microarray data of cp <dig> on the second factor was opposite to the sign of the loadings of the data of c <dig> and c <dig> the absolute weight of the microarray data of c <dig> was much lower than that of the data of c <dig> and cp <dig> , so this factor reflected mainly the difference between the least and most cisplatin resistant cell line. after the factors coinciding with biological contrasts had been identified, the genes responsible for these contrasts were selected as the most extreme ones from the first and second factor. from the first factor <dig> genes were selected and from the second factor <dig> genes . both gene sets had <dig> genes in common. of the <dig> genes selected from the first factor, the expression of <dig> genes was up-regulated and the expression of <dig> genes was down-regulated in cp <dig> + c <dig> + c <dig> compared to a <dig> of the <dig> genes selected from the second factor, the expression of <dig> genes was up-regulated and the expression of <dig> genes was down-regulated in c <dig> + c <dig> compared to cp <dig> to validate the expression of genes selected from the biological factors, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for <dig> genes with gapdh as a control: col3a <dig> eno <dig> fgf <dig> jun, lhx <dig> meis <dig> meis <dig> pbx <dig> pdgfrl, prickle <dig> sat, shb, timp <dig> tlx <dig> top <dig> and uaca. figure <dig> demonstrates that the differential expression pattern of the <dig> genes, as determined with rt-pcr, was comparable to the fa results of the microarray data, confirming the reliability of our analysis of the microarray data. additionally, in table <dig> is shown that there is overlap between our gene lists and gene lists from other groups who have profiled a <dig> and its cisplatin/oxaliplatin resistant subline, confirming our results <cit> . furthermore, fatigo was used to annotate the genes with gene ontology terms and to compare the distribution of the main go terms between the gene list selected from the first and second factor <cit> . as shown in table <dig> the distributions of the main go terms were not significantly different between the two groups of genes. discussion in general fa, as effected by svd, is applied to two-color microarray data for summarizing, filtering and pre-processing data , although several studies have shown fa can be used for gene selection <cit> . a weakness of straightforward application of fa to microarray data without any a-priori expectations regarding the latent structure among the observed data is that there is no straightforward way of objectively assessing model performance. however, in our microarray study we have shown that rather than applying fa directly to the analysis of microarray data, when the structure of the relationships among the variables is specified a-priori, reflected by the design of the study, fa is an efficient method to analyze two-color microarray data. based on this pre-defined hypothesis two latent factors coinciding with differences in cisplatin resistance between four ovarian cancer cell lines were easily identified. the first factor retrieved during the fist step of fa represented the common variation of arrays and the first two factors retrieved during the second step represented differences between arrays. the variation of the arrays is generally explained by only a small number of factors, of which the first represents variation the arrays have in common <cit> . one of the two factors that represented differences between arrays was interpreted as the contrast between the cisplatin sensitive a <dig> cells and the cisplatin resistant cp <dig> c <dig> and c <dig> cells. the other factor was explained as the contrast between the mild cisplatin resistant cp <dig> cells and the extreme cisplatin resistant c <dig> and c <dig> cells. from the first factor <dig> genes and from the second factor <dig> genes were selected and <dig> genes were shared by both gene sets. this overlap makes it very plausible that the two retrieved factors are indeed biologically meaningful. it is biologically plausible that genes that are important for the difference between cisplatin sensitive cells and cisplatin resistant cells are also responsible for the difference in the degree of cisplatin resistance. by using svd for the computation of the latent factors underlying the microarray data, we obtain uncorrelated factors. therefore the outlier genes selected from each factor are not necessarily the same. the expected number of outlier genes common to both factors under the hypothesis of no relation is <dig> , which is much lower than the actually found number of <dig> comparison of selected genes sets from biologically relevant factors between arrays may, thus, be an important tool to validate that the factors are indeed biologically meaningful. the biological relevancy of the factors was also supported by the finding that the loadings of the expression data of the ovarian cancer cell lines on the two contrasts differed which could also be attributed to the differences in the levels of cisplatin resistance of the cell lines. furthermore, the fa data were supported by rt-pcr results for <dig> genes and literature <cit> . analyzing microarray data with cfa has several advantages. with only one algorithm, that is available in any standard statistical software package, both stages of microarray data analysis can be performed. by applying fa, variation in microarray data caused by biological differences can be separated from variation related to the microarray technique. by using svd, we assumed that some latent factors are expected to be correlated with biological processes and others with experimental artifacts. so, applying fa to microarray data also means that to select differentially expressed genes between different classes of samples, the classes do not have to be defined a-priori. an advantage of using uls as fitting method is that no assumption about the distribution of the microarray data has to be made. other microarray analysis methods often assume that the gene expression data follow normal distribution, but in reality the distribution is not necessarily symmetric and its tails can differ in size and shape. a random process leading to non-normal distributions will likely affect all extracted factors to an equal degree. therefore, the statistical distribution of the gene expression data can be estimated from the factors that most likely represent noise. the problem of scale dependency was solved by performing the analyses on the correlation structure instead of the covariance structure. in this analysis we were not hindered by the difficulty that for uls no formal tests are available. instead the false discovery rates for genes selected from biological factors were calculated as indicators for their quality. in addition, there was no real need to assess the fit of the model as the retrieved factors reflected the design of the study, and the false discovery rate was calculated being an indicator for the quality of our proposed cisplatin resistant genes. the identification of biologically meaningful factors is uniquely dependent on the data and cannot be guaranteed. by randomization and balancing of possible confounders of microarray experiments, such as the order of processing , the systematic effects will be orthogonal and are likely to show up as factors. rotation of the factor analysis structure is eventually possible and will not result in a substantial decrease in the amount of variance explained. another disadvantage may be that to use cfa the design of the two-color microarray study ideally should include 'selfself' hybridizations, dye swaps and independent replications, which may not always be the most efficient design due to the increasing number of arrays. biological factors are not easily identified when fa is applied to designs not including orthogonal contrasts, i.e. without 'selfself' hybridizations or dye swaps, necessary to pre-define the structure of the relationships among the variables . examples of such designs not including orthogonal contrast are balanced block designs or loop designs <cit> . CONCLUSIONS in conclusion, our results show that fa is an efficient method to analyze two-color microarray data provided that there is a pre-defined hypothesis reflected in an orthogonal design.",

    "prompt": "Summarize this clinical report for a busy practitioner. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND three-dimensional protein structures provide invaluable insights into the molecular basis of protein functions, and such insights are essential for rational design of molecules regulating these functions. nowadays, in an increasing number of cases, it has become possible to model protein structures with acceptable accuracy by employing much less effort than that required in experimental methods. progress in computational protein structure prediction has been boosted by methodological improvements in the technique called template-based modeling , which uses experimental structures of homologous proteins as templates. as biological sequence and structure databases expand continuously, tbm is expected to become an even more promising tool for practical molecular biology, pharmaceutical chemistry, and protein engineering problems <cit> . template-based modeling, also called homology modeling or comparative modeling, generally consists of the following steps <cit> : identification of homologous proteins with known structures to be used as templates; alignment of the sequences of the target and templates; creation of model structures from the alignment; and refinement of the models. contemporary methods usually treat each stage separately, and the full tbm procedure can therefore be established by combining methods for each of the above stages. despite recent progresses, there still remain challenges for each stage mentioned above. one of the important challenges is how to optimally combine information from multiple templates to build a single model when experimental structures of multiple homologues are available. using multiple templates rather than a single template offers several obvious benefits: the possibility of including a better template increases, and the fraction of the target sequence covered by templates is extended <cit> . in addition, different regions in template structures may be combined to produce a more accurate model <cit> . however, in practice, it is complicated to combine information from multiple templates in an optimal way <cit> . since the average quality of multiple templates is bound to be worse than that of the single best template, using multiple templates is associated with a rather large risk of contaminating reliable information from the best template. to overcome this problem, various approaches have been proposed <cit> . most of them heavily rely on a single top template while additional templates are used to fill the gaps not covered by the top template <cit> . another challenge is to model structurally variable regions among templates or those regions not covered by any templates, which we call ulrs . unless the target sequence is quite similar to those of the templates , the expected quality of template-based models could be limited by such regions. moreover, such ill-conserved regions where sequence insertion/deletion occurs may not be the subject of typical tbm. despite previous efforts, progress in modeling such regions seems to be rather limited <cit> . since high-resolution models are required for practical applications, it is doubtless that better ulr modeling is essential. we recognize that the above <dig> challenges are not independent of each other. for example, the performance of ulr modeling can be limited by the quality of the framework structure constructed from multiple templates <cit> . we therefore propose a strategy by which both initial tbm and subsequent ulr modeling can benefit from each other. in the initial tbm, we focus on accurate modeling of more conserved regions among multiple templates, without the need to consider potentially unreliable regions since such regions are taken care of in the ulr modeling stage. in the ulr modeling stage, we fix the more reliable core structure so as not to deteriorate the overall model quality by potentially less reliable ab initio ulr modeling. therefore, ulrs can be modeled in a more accurate framework structure, and the conformational search space for ulr modeling is also effectively reduced to the local regions. related approaches that construct a reliable core and refine unreliable regions have been proposed previously <cit> . the difference between our approach and these is that we put more stress on the “accuracy” of the core structure in the initial tbm stage . we call this new method galaxytbm, as it is based on the galaxy molecular modeling package <cit> . galaxytbm employs a multiple-template method designed to produce reliable core structures by rescoring hhsearch <cit> results for multiple-template selection and by core sequence alignment using promals3d <cit> . model building from the alignment and subsequent ulr modeling is performed using optimization modules in galaxy <cit> . all components of the prediction pipeline were tested in the 9th critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction as a predictor named “seok-server.” according to the official results of casp <dig> seok-server is recognized as one of the top <dig> servers <cit> . since the prediction strategy for seok-server had to be modified a few times during casp <dig> as the method was immature at the beginning, the most recent version, galaxytbm, is presented here. when galaxytbm was tested on <dig> single-domain casp <dig> tbm targets, fixing the structure database at the version with which seok-server was used during casp <dig> it reproduced the performance of seok-server . performance of the tbm pipeline was evaluated by analyzing the improvements achieved at each stage. merits of the new components in the pipeline over other tbm methods are also discussed. RESULTS rescoring of hhsearch results improves the template quality we used a simple but effective rescoring strategy to select multiple templates from the homologues detected by hhsearch <cit> , as described in the methods section. here, we analyzed the performance of the rescoring method in terms of the quality of the top ranker compared to that of the hhsearch top ranker. template quality was measured by a similarity score called tm-score calculated using the tm-align tool <cit> , which ranges from <dig> to <dig> . improvement achieved by the selection scheme of “multiple” templates is discussed in the next subsection. overall, top rankers obtained by the rescoring scheme were closer to the native structures of the target proteins than the hhsearch top rankers, when tested on the <dig> single-domain casp <dig> tbm targets. different proteins ranked as top by rescoring in <dig> out of the <dig> cases, with an average improvement of <dig> in tm-score. tm-score increased for <dig> out of the <dig> targets and decreased for the remaining <dig> targets, with average increases of <dig> and − <dig> , respectively. a paired t-test for the tm-score changes for the <dig> targets showed that the improvement is statistically significant, with a p-value of <dig> . as can be seen from figure <dig> the improvement did not strongly correlate with target difficulty. it is also notable that outstanding improvement was obtained in some cases. for example, the top ranker in the hhsearch for t <dig> had a low tm-score of <dig> , but the rescoring scheme ranked a protein with a tm-score of <dig> as the first, although this protein ranked very low in the original hhsearch. these improvements could be primarily attributed to the greater consideration of the secondary structure score when scoring more difficult targets . in other words, when sequence conservation between target protein and homologues is low, information on secondary structure conservation can be more helpful in selecting closer homologues. multiple-template information improves the model quality in addition to selecting top rankers successfully, the template rescoring method is also effective in providing candidates for multiple templates. multiple templates were selected by filtering out structural outliers from the candidates after core structure alignment . to assess the improvement achieved by using multiple templates, model structures built from the multiple templates were compared with those built from the single top template and those from a naïve multiple template selection method that considers all proteins with hhsearch e-values < 10- <dig> . the average number of templates selected by galaxytbm and the naïve method was <dig> and <dig> , respectively. for each target and for each method, <dig> models were generated by modeller <cit> , and gdt-ts score averaged over them is reported. although tm-score is used for measuring the quality of a “template” which has a different sequence from the native protein, the gdt-ts measure is used for assessing the quality of a “model” with the same sequence. by using the current multiple template approach, gdt-ts improved when compared to the values obtained using the single-template approach and the naïve multiple-template method . the gdt-ts improvement is statistically significant, with p-values of <dig> and <dig> , respectively. improvement over the naïve method was prominent when high-ranking proteins by hhsearch have diverse structures, implying that the current multiple-template selection scheme that excludes dissimilar structures is fairly successful. for example, for t <dig> mean gdt-ts of generated models is <dig> and <dig> by the current approach and by the naïve approach, respectively. similar type of large gdt-ts improvement of > <dig> was also found in t <dig> t <dig> t <dig> t <dig> and t <dig> to determine whether the model improvement by the multiple-template approach is a consequence of covering more residues by additional templates, we checked whether a similar improvement was found for core regions . the core region is defined here as the target residues aligned with the single top template by promals3d <cit> . the core region covers 31% to 100% of the whole protein, with an average coverage of 85%. as shown in figure 2a, gdt-ts of the core region was also improved by the current multiple-template method compared to the single-template method. average gdt-ts improvement was <dig> %, with a p-value of <dig> . in conclusion, the current multiple template selection method contributes to improving the core structure by utilizing useful information from additional templates selected by the current pipeline. better optimization during model-building further improves the model quality in galaxytbm, model building is performed by the modeller-csa <cit> module implemented in galaxy. it was previously reported that more thorough optimization of the target restraint function derived by modeller is possible with the method, generating model structures more consistent with the restraints <cit> . to evaluate the performance of model building in the current pipeline, we compared the structures generated in this stage with the model structures generated simply by using modeller <cit> . the <dig> methods, modeller and modeller-csa, use the same sequence alignments, template lists, and therefore the same spatial restraints, and differ only in the optimization method. as in the previous subsection, <dig> model structures were generated for each target. overall, model building by modeller-csa improved the sum of gdt-ts by <dig> % compared to modeller, with a p-value of <dig> . average gdt-ts improvement was <dig> for the <dig> targets for which single templates were used and <dig> for the <dig> targets for which multiple templates were used. the better gdt-ts improvement in the multiple-template cases can be explained by the fact that the more complex target restraint functions for the multiple-template problems can be better optimized with the more rigorous optimization method <cit> . in addition to the backbone structure quality, the side-chain structure quality was also improved by the better optimization during model building. the χ <dig> accuracy was improved in <dig> out of <dig> targets, with an average improvement of <dig> %. the χ1 + χ <dig> accuracy was also improved . this improvement is consistent with the findings of the previous report by joo et al. <cit> . positive effects of the overall multiple-template strategy to illustrate the effects of the overall multiple-template strategy in more detail, the relationship between the model quality improvement and the template quality improvement achieved by the use of multiple templates is demonstrated in figure <dig> in this figure, model qualities were measured for the core region, instead of the whole structure, to clarify the impact of using multiple templates. the points in the upper right corner of figure <dig> represent the cases in which templates of higher quality than the top ranker contribute to improving the model quality. this is one of the expected positive effects of using multiple templates. it is particularly intriguing that in a non-negligible number of cases , model quality was improved even when the average template quality decreased from that of the top single template , particularly in those where no additional templates had better quality than the top ranker . this effect may be attributed in part to the success of the multiple-template selection method, which can pick out additional complementary templates without introducing large negative effects of contaminating good information from the top ranker. improvement by more thorough optimization in the model-building stage is more pronounced in the left side of the figure, where the average template quality was worse than that of the top ranker. the above analysis indicates that the positive effects of using multiple templates can be maximized by the current template selection strategy that considers core structure consensus and the more rigorous optimization during model-building, and the common adverse effects caused by including inconsistent templates in typical multiple-template methods can be minimized by use of such a combination. ulr refinement also contributes to improvement of the model quality here we present the results of the final stage of the pipeline, i.e., refinement of ulrs. a total of <dig> ulrs were detected in the initial stage, and <dig> ulrs were finally subject to reconstruction following the selection rule described in methods. these reconstructed ulrs consisted not only of the regions that were not aligned to any template residues but also of the regions that were structurally inconsistent among templates. of the <dig> reconstructed ulrs, <dig> ulrs corresponded to the regions in which more than half of the residues are disordered in experimental structures and thus were neglected in the following analysis. in figure <dig> rmsds of the ulr structures before and after refinement are compared for each ulr. the average improvement in rmsd achieved by refinement was <dig> Å. the rmsd improvement was statistically significant, with a p-value of <dig> . since the current refinement changes only local regions, improvement in the overall structure measured by gdt-ts was rather small. the sum of gdt-ts over <dig> domains containing refined ulrs increased by <dig> % , with an average increase of <dig> per domain. although the improvement was small, it is statistically significant, with a p-value of <dig> . more accurate prediction of ulr regions is invaluable for functional or design studies that involve such protein-specific local regions. it is also notable that the current refinement result is comparable to the results obtained by seok-server in casp <dig> <cit> , even though a lighter ulr optimization strategy has been employed. computational cost template selection and multiple sequence alignment take a few minutes on a single core. the median time required for model building with modeller-csa and refinement was <dig> and <dig> hours, respectively, when <dig> cores were used in parallel. CONCLUSIONS in this article, we report a new tbm method—galaxytbm—that builds reliable core structure from multiple templates and reconstructs unreliable regions by ab initio loop or terminus modeling in the fixed framework of the core structure. the current multiple-template strategy maximizes the positive effects of using multiple templates by selecting complementary multiple templates that do not contaminate the information from the best template significantly and by thorough optimization of possibly conflicting template restraints during model building. when model refinement by detection and re-building of unreliable loop or terminus regions is applied, additional improvement in model quality is observed. several sound elements of the current strategy, such as template rescoring, multiple-template selection based on core-structure alignment, and multiple sequence alignment of core sequences could be easily incorporated into other tbm methods to enhance their performance.",

resulting in a potentially fatal illness called legionnaires’ disease <cit> . human infection occurs through inhalation of aerosols originating from legionella-contaminated sources, such as cooling towers, air conditioning and heating systems, fountains and even showers <cit> . upon entry into alveolar macrophages, lp prevents fusion with lysosomes, modulates host cell trafficking, forms a legionella-containing vacuole and then starts intracellular multiplication <cit> . in recent years, the occurrence rate of ld has been reported to be on the increase in many countries <cit> . in the us, the incidence rate of ld increased by 192 % over the last decade <cit> . in europe, france, italy and spain consistently have the highest number of reported cases, with <dig> to <dig> cases per thousand in <dig> <cit> . most of these are sporadic cases, either community-acquired, nosocomial or travel-associated <cit> . nevertheless, outbreak of ld in which a large population gets exposed to contaminated aerosols from a point-source is of great concern. investigations of previous outbreaks show that the dispersal distance of lp from cooling towers and air scrubbers can be greater than 10 km <cit> . many bacteria, such as bacillus megaterium, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and vibrio cholera, die steadily upon exposure to freshwater <cit> . chandran et al. <cit> showed that the colony-forming units of escherichia coli and vibrio parahaemolyticus decreased by <dig> logs after 27 days of exposure to lake water. in contrast, lp is able to survive for a prolonged period of time in freshwater despite the lack of nutrients . in an earlier study, lp exposed to drinking water and creek water had a mere <dig> log reduction in cfu counts and still maintained 3 × 106 cfu/ml after an incubation time of <dig> years <cit> . the ability of lp to survive in water for long periods is essential for the colonization of water systems, allowing it to persist until optimal conditions and permissive hosts for its growth are encountered. survival in water is, therefore crucial for the transmission of lp to the human host. in turn, it is important to understand the genetic factors of lp that allow its prolonged survival in water. this knowledge may allow future development of strategies that prohibit the survival of lp in water systems and eventually help control legionella outbreaks. lp possesses approximately <dig> genes, in which <dig> genes are commonly found in all six strains <cit> . as a human pathogen, the genes involved in virulence have been extensively studied . two major secretion systems, the lsp type ii secretion system and the icm/dot type ivb secretion system , translocate more than <dig> effector proteins into the host cell and are critical for the virulence of lp <cit> . moreover, many other genes act as virulence factors that directly contribute to host cell infection or as virulence regulators . apart from the virulence genes, a recent study has showed that at least <dig> genes are essential for optimal growth of lp in rich medium <cit> . however, the functions of many lp genes still remains unknown. to date, only a few genes are known to be important for the survival of lp in water. söderberg et al. <cit> studied the survival of lspd, lspe, lspf and pild mutants in tap water and concluded that the t2ss is important for lp to maintain survival at temperatures between <dig> and 17 °c. recently, our group has shown that the sigma factor rpos and the stringent response are required for the survival of lp in water <cit> . given the lack of knowledge and the associated risk to public health, it is necessary to identify more lp genes that are required for survival in water. bacteria typically respond to environmental changes through transcriptomic reorganization, where they express genes that are essential for coping with the new condition and repress genes that are no longer required, or that are detrimental <cit> . comparison of transcriptional changes using microarrays can be used to identify candidate genes needed in a particular condition . recently, this technique has been used to identify a new gene, irot, involved in ferrous ion transport based on the transcriptomic profile of lp in an iron restricted condition <cit> . in this study, we use a transcriptomic approach to identify genes that are potentially involved in the survival of lp in water. since bacteria tend to have immediate transcriptomic responses within the first few hours upon exposure to stressful conditions <cit> , the transcriptomic response of lp to water was studied at an early time point , an intermediate time point and a late time point . genes involved in adaptation and regulatory functions are induced in water, while those involved in energy metabolism and translation are repressed. in particular, our analysis shows that bdha is strongly expressed upon exposure to water, and the deletion of bdha reduces the survival of lp in water at 37 °c. RESULTS survival of lp in fraquil in order to ensure reproducibility, an artificial freshwater medium was used to perform the transcriptomic analysis. the freshwater medium fraquil was selected for this purpose since it mimics the composition of freshwater in north america <cit> . the survival of the wild-type strain jr <dig> in fraquil at 25 °c is shown in fig. 1a. the population of lp in fraquil was stable for at least five weeks.fig. <dig> lp survives well in water at 25 °c. a cfu counts of jr <dig> during five weeks of exposure to fraquil. dl indicates the detection limit at 100

staining was used with flow cytometry to determine the status of <dig> cells in each sample. d forward scatter of jr <dig> cultured in aye broth or exposed to fraquil. each sample had three biological replicates and the mean fsc signal of <dig> cells in each replicate was detected by flow cytometry for the transcriptomic analysis, jr <dig> was first cultured in aces-buffered yeast extract broth to exponential phase in triplicate and 1 ml samples were harvested to serve as controls. then, the cells were washed three times with fraquil and re-suspended in fraquil at a final od <dig> of <dig> . the three re-suspensions were transferred to vessels of a biostat® q plus bioreactor to control temperature and dissolved oxygen. samples were taken after <dig> <dig> and 24 h of exposure and compared to controls grown in aye broth. at each time point, we performed both cfu counts and live/dead staining. although both aye samples and fraquil samples were at the same optical density, the cfu counts of jr <dig> exposed to fraquil were consistently lower, albeit by a very small margin, than jr <dig> from aye broth . there were no significant differences in cfu counts between the fraquil samples at the different time points tested. flow cytometry analysis of live/dead staining was used to evaluate the percentage of viable cells and showed that there were no differences between samples . taking into account cfu counts and cell staining, lp showed no significant survival defects within the first 24 h of exposure to fraquil. based on the flow cytometry data, a steady reduction in the forward scatter was observed in jr <dig> upon exposure to fraquil . the lowest average fsc signal was observed in fraquil samples after 24 h . since the fsc signal is proportional to particle size <cit> , this result indicates that lp undergoes a gradual reduction in cell size after exposure to water. transcriptomic response of lp exposed to water in order to understand the genetic regulation of lp during short-term exposure to water, we performed a transcriptomic analysis through dna microarray hybridization. rna was extracted from exponential phase and fraquil-treated samples and the data of each treatment was compared with the control. compared to jr <dig> growing in aye broth, the expression of <dig> annotated genes and <dig> predicted srna encoding sequences changed significantly , in at least one time point after exposure to fraquil . a progressive transcriptomic change over time is clearly seen in the heat map showing the induction and repression of genes . the percentages of significantly up- and down-regulated genes increased from <dig> to 6 h of water exposure, while more genes were significantly down-regulated than up-regulated after 24 h . there were <dig> % up-regulated genes and <dig> % down-regulated genes after 2 h of water exposure, demonstrating the rapid transcriptional responses of lp upon exposure to fraquil.fig. <dig> progressive transcriptomic changes of lp in water. the global gene expression of jr <dig> after <dig> <dig> and 24 h exposure to fraquil in comparison with the control cultured in aye broth is shown in the heat map. the hierarchical clustering shows the similarities between samples. the genes that were up-regulated are shown in red and those down-regulated are shown in green fig. <dig> many lp genes are shut down

number of genes differently expressed over a total of <dig> annotated genes from the original genome annotation. cluster of orthologous groups analysis of jr <dig> genes after 2 h, 6 h and 24 h of exposure to fraquil is shown. up-regulated genes are shown in red and down-regulated genes are shown in green genes that were differentially expressed after water exposure were categorized into orthologous groups. after <dig> and 6 h of water exposure, seven of the <dig> orthologous groups had a higher percentage of up-regulated genes . these orthologous groups are “chemotaxis/motility/cell division”, “detoxification/adaptation”, “icm/dot effector”, “signal transduction/other regulatory functions”, “transcription”, “unclassified/unknown/hypothetical” and “viral functions/phage/transposases”. in contrast, all <dig> orthologous groups showed major down-regulation of genes after 24 h of water exposure . at each time point, “energy metabolism”, “translation” and “transport and binding” remained the top three orthologous groups with the highest percentage of down-regulated genes. examples of genes in these orthologous groups are listed in table <dig> and <dig>

groups. according to the microarray data, six of the selected genes and lpg2524) were significantly up-regulated in water at two or all three time points, while the remaining four genes were significantly down-regulated . the rt-qpcr results for these <dig> genes are shown in fig. 4b. despite some differences, the general expression profiles were conserved between the microarray and rt-qpcr data, which validates the former.fig. <dig> microarray data is validated by rt-qpcr. transcriptomic changes of ten selected jr <dig> genes upon water exposure shown by microarray analysis and rt-qpcr. results are shown as the log <dig> ratio between the samples exposed to fraquil for <dig> <dig> or 24 h and the control cultured in aye broth antibiotic resistance of lp subsequent to water exposure many genes involved in detoxification and adaptation were induced in water, including some associated with antibiotic resistance, such as an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a spectinomycin phosphotransferase, an erythromycin transporter and several efflux pumps . the induction of these genes may increase the resistance of water-exposed lp to antibiotics. to investigate this hypothesis, we compared the antibiotic resistance of lp cultured in aye broth to exponential phase and those exposed to fraquil for 24 h. in both cases, we compared the cfu counts with and without the addition of a β-lactam , two aminoglycosides and a macrolide . in order to determine the impact of temperature on antibiotic resistance, lp was grown in aye and exposed to fraquil at both 25 °c and 37 °c prior to testing resistance. there were no significant differences in the cfu counts between aye-grown and fraquil-exposed lp treated with ampicillin . lp grown in aye at 37 °c was more susceptible to erythromycin than lp grown in aye at 25 °c or lp exposed to fraquil at either temperature. lp exposed to fraquil was significantly more resistant to gentamycin than lp grown in aye broth, regardless of the temperature. moreover, exposure to 37 °c seems to slightly increase susceptibility to gentamycin. lp was more resistant to kanamycin after exposure to fraquil than when grown in aye, and this difference was more pronounced at 37 °c. overall, lp is more resistant to aminoglycosides after exposure to fraquil, which is consistent with our prediction based on the transcriptomic data. incubation temperature also seems to affect antibiotic resistance, especially against erythromycin.fig. <dig> lp exposed to water is more resistant to antibiotics. cfu changes of lp cultured in aye broth or exposed to fraquil at <dig> or 37 °c after antibiotic treatments. the antibiotics used include ampicillin, erythromycin, gentamycin and kanamycin, all at 100 μg/ml. 5x indicates a five times concentration of erythromycin and gentamycin were used as well. the data are expressed as the log transformation of cfus in treated wells divided by the cfus in the control wells without antibiotics . a negative value indicates a cfu reduction upon treatment. data shows the mean +/− sd of three biological replicates. different letters on the bars indicate significant differences between different samples in a particular treatment according to tukey's test . cfu changes between different treatments were not compared importance of bdha for the survival of lp in water genes that are significantly induced upon exposure to fraquil may be important for lp to survive in water. upon this premise, the highly up-regulated bdha gene was selected for further characterization. a deletion mutant of bdha and its complement were constructed. for the complementation, bdha was cloned downstream of the ptac promoter on pmmb207c. the wild-type strain ks <dig> Δbdha, spf <dig> without isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and spf <dig> with 1 mm iptg were exposed to fraquil at <dig> and 37 °c. cfu counts were monitored weekly and their survival was also assessed by live/dead staining after 19 weeks of exposure, when the cfus of all strains at 37 °c dropped below the detection limit. no survival defects were observed in the mutant strain compared to the wild-type or the complements in fraquil at 25 °c . however, a minor reduction in the cfu counts was observed in all strains after 20 weeks of water exposure. an overall faster drop in cfus was observed in all strains at 37 °c, compared to 25 °c . the bdha mutant strain showed a more rapid reduction in cfus than the wild-type strain. this phenotype was complemented by expression of bdha from the ptac promoter in the presence of iptg . the cfu count of spf <dig> without iptg was similar to the bdha mutant strain. therefore, bdha seems to be required for the survival of lp in water at 37 °c.fig. <dig> bdha is important for long-term survival of lp in water. weekly cfu counts of the wild-type ks <dig> Δbdha and its complement spf <dig> with and without iptg exposed to fraquil at 25 °c and 37 °c. 1 mm iptg was used to induce bdha on the plasmid of the complemented strain. data show the mean +/− sd of three biological replicates. dl: detection limit. c percentage of live, undefined or dead cells of ks <dig> Δbdha and its complement spf <dig> with and without iptg. live/dead staining analysed by flow cytometry was performed after the strains were exposed to fraquil for 19 weeks at <dig> and 37 °c since the cfu counts of all strains exposed to 37 °c decreased below the detection limit after 19 weeks of water exposure, we sought to determine if the cells entered a viable but non-culturable state at this time point <cit> . to this end, we used a live/dead staining procedure together with flow cytometry. at 25 °c, no significant differences in the percentage of viable cells were observed between strains , which is consistent with the cfu counts. on the other hand, the wild-type strain showed a small fraction of dead cells at 37 °c, which is not significant compared to 25 °c. in comparison, only 61 % cells of the bdha mutant strain were stained as viable. the complemented strain exposed to water in the presence of iptg had a higher percentage of viable cells but was still lower than that of the wild-type strain. taken together with the cfu counts, our results show that lp enters a vbnc state after 19 weeks of exposure to fraquil at 37 °c. regulation of bdha by rpos hovel-miner et al. <cit> showed that the expression of bdha in a rich medium is regulated by rpos when lp reaches the post-exponential phase. moreover, transcriptomic analysis of the rpos mutant in water suggests that the expression of bdha is rpos-dependant <cit> . therefore, we investigated this possibility of rpos regulation of bdha by using a green fluorescent protein reporter assay <cit> . briefly, a plasmid carrying the pbdha-gfp transcriptional fusion was constructed and transformed into jr <dig> and the rpos mutant . jr <dig> harbouring the pxdc <dig> plasmid, which expresses gfp from the ptac promoter in the presence of iptg, was used as positive control. jr <dig> and rpos mutant strains with a plasmid containing no promoter upstream of the gfp encoding sequence served as negative controls. each strain was exposed to aye broth or fraquil for 24 h and the level of gfp in terms of green fluorescence signal was measured by flow cytometry. a significantly higher level of gfp was found to be expressed in ks <dig> psf <dig> exposed to fraquil than that exposed to aye broth, suggesting that the promoter of bdha was more highly induced after 24 h in water . this induction is consistent with the up-regulation of bdha observed in jr <dig> exposed to water for the same period of time during the transcriptomic analysis . gfp expression in rpos psf <dig> was higher than in the negative controls under both conditions, but it was significantly lower than that of ks <dig> psf <dig> in addition, no significant differences were found between rpos psf <dig> in aye broth compared to fraquil. these findings confirm that expression of bdha in lp is positively regulated by rpos.fig. <dig> bdha is highly induced in water and regulated by rpos. green fluorescence signal of five different strains after 24 h of exposure to aye broth or fraquil. jr <dig> psf <dig> rpos psf <dig> jr <dig> psf <dig> and rpos psf <dig> represent spf <dig> spf <dig> spf <dig> and spf <dig> respectively. jr <dig> pxdc <dig> was induced with 1 mm iptg. each sample had three biological replicates and the mean green fluorescence signal of <dig> cells in each replicate was detected by flow cytometry discussion as a bacterium that lives in aqueous environments, lp is frequently exposed to various stresses, such as fluctuations in temperature, ph and levels trace metals, as well as nutrient limitation <cit> . nutrient limitation, in particular, is a major concern as the nutrient levels in freshwater rarely fits the growth requirement of lp, which is an auxotroph for at least eight amino acids <cit> . in the absence of essential nutrients or suitable hosts, lp cannot grow, but can still persist in water for over one year <cit> . previous work has shown that the t2ss is important for the survival of lp in water at low temperature <cit> . however, no studies have investigated the global transcriptomic response of lp to freshwater. in response to this knowledge gap, we performed a transcriptomic analysis to study the changes in gene expression of lp exposed to fraquil, an artificial freshwater medium composed of trace amounts of salts and metals, compared to lp grown in rich medium . since lp in stationary phase culture is under nutrient limitation and stresses, using it as the control may hinder the opportunity to identify important genes for its survival in water. therefore, lp in the exponential phase of growth was used as the control. in fraquil, lp maintained a stable population for at least 35 days and did not show any growth . nevertheless, a significant reduction in cell size was found within 24 h of water exposure , which might be an adaptative response of lp to nutrient limitation. in fact, the reduction of cell size is commonly observed in bacteria experiencing environmental stresses, such as nutrient limitation, suboptimal ph and low temperatures . for example, the cell length of v. parahaemolyticus under starvation decreased drastically from <dig> to <dig> μm within 24 h <cit> . such a morphological change is believed to be a strategy to minimize the metabolic requirements for cell maintenance <cit> . the mature intracellular form of lp, produced after passage through hela cells and tetrahymena tropicalis, also shows a reduction in cell size, suggesting that this morphological change may be a response of lp to nutrient limitation <cit> . the transcriptomic study of lp revealed significant changes in gene expression following exposure to fraquil. since fraquil does not contain any carbon sources that lp can use, it is unable to grow in this medium . consistent with this observation, expression of several amino acid transporters was induced in water . therefore, the reduced expression of three cell division proteins, such as ftsa, ftsq and ftsw, was expected . moreover, bacteria tend to shut down major metabolic pathways when under starvation <cit> . following exposure to water, genes involved in the electron transport chain and eight genes encoding subunits of the atp synthase were significantly repressed . this suggests a lower level of energy metabolism and thus, reduced metabolic activity in lp, as the down-regulation of atp synthase is usually found in dormant bacteria with a lower cellular atp level <cit> . furthermore, compared to the control growing in aye broth, the total rna extracted from lp exposed to water dropped markedly after 2 h and reduced to only one tenth of the control after 24 h . this finding is consistent with the down-regulation of rpoa, rpob and rpoc, which encode subunits of rna polymerase, potentially resulting in less rna polymerase available to bind to dna and initiate transcription . in addition, most of the genes encoding 30s ribosomal proteins, 50s ribosomal proteins, translation initiation factors, translation elongation factors as well as trnas were down-regulated in water in two or all three time points tested . in total, the expression of eight rpm genes, <dig> rps genes and <dig> rpl genes was significantly reduced . in addition, lpg <dig> was strongly induced in water. this gene encodes a homolog of yhbh, which is a short hibernation promoting factor with a highly conserved function in γ-proteobacteria <cit> . short hpf stabilizes the dimerization of two 70s ribosomes into a translationally inactive 100s ribosome by a ribosome modulation factor, resulting in ribosome hibernation <cit> . ribosome hibernation is commonly found in bacteria experiencing nutrient limitation and is rapidly reversible when nutrients become available once again <cit> . in e. coli, a mutant unable to form 100s ribosomes survived poorly in the post-exponential phase <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the up-regulation of lpg <dig> in lp may allow the formation of 100s ribosomes to maintain long-term survival in water, and the ability to resume growth or intracellular multiplication. our findings suggest that the translational machinery of lp is shut down following exposure to water, which is a typical characteristic of the bacterial stringent response <cit> . the stringent response is the reallocation of cellular resources in bacteria under nutrient limitation, by prohibiting the synthesis of dna, stable rnas, ribosomal proteins and membrane components, and activating the synthesis of factors involved in amino acid synthesis, glycolysis and stress resistance <cit> . the massive transcriptomic changes during the stringent response are mediated by the synthesis and accumulation of guanosine tetraphosphate and guanosine pentaphosphate , which are called ppgpp collectively <cit> . the stringent response in lp has been studied in detail. under amino acid limitation, the binding of uncharged trnas to the a site in ribosomes triggers the ribosomal-associated rela protein to synthesize ppgpp <cit> . spot, the second stringent response protein, can also synthesize ppgpp in response to other signals, such as perturbation of fatty acid synthesis <cit> . spot possesses a hydrolase activity as well, and therefore, regulates the level of ppgpp and is necessary to terminate the stringent response <cit> . in lp, the stringent response, and the rela and spot proteins are necessary for replication inside host cells and initiation of the transmissive phase <cit> . our results clearly show a repression of the translational machinery, cell replication and changes in metabolic processes, which are consistent with the general transcriptional modulations caused by ppgpp <cit> . in addition, we have recently shown that the stringent response is required for the survival of lp in water <cit> . due to the imminent shutdown of the translational machinery following water exposure, the important genes should be induced early on to allow the synthesis of their products when lp is still translationally active. therefore, in order to identify genes essential to maintain long-term survival in water, we examined those that are highly up-regulated within 24 h, a time point when a major metabolic shutdown started to appear. first, many genes associated with the biosynthesis of flagella, including different assembly, regulatory and structural proteins, are up-regulated in lp exposed to water . this response is comparable to the response of lp that reaches the late replicative phase inside host cells. due to exploitation of host cell resources and consequent lack of nutrients, the transmissive phase of lp is triggered, leading to the expression of virulence-associated traits such as flagella formation and other factors to promote release from the host <cit> . many genes induced at early time points possess a function related to detoxification and adaptation . genes involved in resistance to oxidative stress were induced, including sodc, ahpc and ahpd. we also observed the induction heat shock proteins in water . in e. coli, heat shock proteins are known to be induced by starvation <cit> . they increase bacterial tolerance against various stresses by degrading and reactivating damaged proteins <cit> . therefore, it is plausible that the up-regulation of these genes may help lp to persist in water under starvation conditions. in addition, many genes involved in antibiotic resistance were induced at early time points, including lpg <dig> , lpg <dig> , lpg <dig> , and several efflux pumps . increased resistance to antibiotics is a hallmark of lp mifs <cit> . this phenomenon was also described after incubation of lp in acanthamoeba castellanii buffer at ph <dig> <cit> . antibiotic resistance genes may be important for lp to compete against antibiotic-producing microorganisms residing in water. in water, lp is more resistant to gentamycin and kanamycin than when it is cultured in rich medium . water-exposed lp is also more resistant to erythromycin, but only at a temperature of 37 °c. since all these antibiotics target the ribosome, it is also possible that the increased resistance is due to a decrease in translational activity, and not solely because of the expression of resistance genes. differential expression of some genes involved in virulence was also apparent. despite the repression of <dig> of the <dig> structural genes of the icm/dot secretion system , the expression of many icm/dot effectors was increased in water . in addition, the enhanced-entry genes enha and enhb, and several of the enhc homologs, as well as the rtxa toxin were induced in water at early time points. on the other hand, the macrophage infectivity potentiator gene, mip, was significantly down regulated in water. it is not clear at this point if these changes in expression of virulence genes affect the intracellular multiplication of lp in host cells after incubation in water. we are currently investigating this possibility. many genes involved in transcriptional regulation were up-regulated, including numerous transcriptional regulators from different families, dna binding proteins, a transcription repair coupling factor and the alternative sigma factor σ <dig> . interestingly, rpon is important for the induction of flia and other flagellar genes <cit> . consistent with previous observations, our results show up-regulation of both σ <dig> and flagellar genes in water. several response regulators, sensory proteins and signal transduction proteins involved in “signal transduction/other regulatory functions” were also up-regulated. among these, many genes encoding proteins harbouring ggdef/eal domains were induced in water . these proteins are involved in the production and destruction of the second messenger c-di-gmp, and several of them have been shown to play a role in the interaction of lp with host cells <cit> . some of them could play a role in sensing exposure to water and regulating the appropriate response. moreover, expression of the two-component system leta/s was reduced in water, while expression of the small rnas rsmy and rsmz under its control was increased. these srnas are necessary to relieve csra-mediated repression of transmissive phase traits upon starvation inside host cells <cit> . our results suggest that some of the genes repressed by csra could be involved in the survival of lp in water. interestingly, a link has been made between leta/s, rpos and ppgpp <cit> . it is noteworthy that expression of the 6s rna was also induced in water. 6s rna binds to the rna polymerase holoenzyme and inhibits its binding to promoters <cit> . since the affinity of 6s rna to the rnap depends on sigma factors, 6s rna can shut down specific transcriptional programs. in e. coli, the σ <dig> regulon is turned off in the presence of 6s rna <cit> . in lp, deletion of 6s rna reduces fitness during intracellular growth <cit> . expression of 6s rna in water could help lp to switch between different transcriptomic programs, but further investigation is needed to confirm its involvement. there are also many other srnas that are differentially regulated, but since their targets are unknown, it is not yet possible to predict specific functions. within the highly up-regulated genes in water, we characterized bdha, which is involved in the polyhydroxybutyrate cycle <cit> . phb is an important storage polymer in bacteria, which is synthesized as a carbon and energy reserve in the presence of external nutrients and is consumed during starvation <cit> . the bdha gene encodes 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, which oxidizes depolymerised phb into acetoacetate and produces reducing power in the form of nadh <cit> . acetoacetate can, then, be further processed into acetyl-coa, which enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle <cit> . bdha is dispensable for lp growth in the presence of external nutrients, as mutations in this gene do not result in any observable growth defects in aye broth <cit> . however, aurass et al. <cit> demonstrated that a bdha-patd mutant strain of lp is defective in breaking down phb accumulated during growth in a rich medium, resulting in a higher level of cellular phb than the wild-type. in addition, this mutant has defects in intracellular growth in amoeba and in human macrophages <cit> . therefore, we hypothesize that bdha is important for lp to survive in water, enabling the extraction of carbon and reducing power from phb in order to allow cell maintenance in the absence of an external energy source. our results show that the deletion of bdha reduces the survival of lp in water. the Δbdha strain lost culturability and seems to have entered the vbnc state earlier, resulting in a higher percentage of mortality after 19 weeks of water exposure at 37 °c compared to the wild-type. this survival defect was successfully complemented, supporting the hypothesis that lp needs bdha for the complete degradation of phb in order to maintain long-term survival in water. it is noteworthy that the difference in survival between Δbdha and the wild-type was only observed at 37 °c but not at 25 °c. since the samples were exhausted after 20 weeks of sampling, we could not determine if the observed difference was eventually be mirrored at 25 °c after a longer period of water exposure. it is possible that survival at 37 °c requires more energy for cell maintenance than at 25 °c because of a higher metabolic rate, protein turnover and overall damage, and thus, the advantage conferred by bdha is more apparent at the higher temperature. in addition, we investigated the regulation of bdha expression by rpos when lp is exposed to water. rpos is a well-known regulator of the response to nutrient limitation <cit> . recently, we have shown that the stringent response and the sigma factor rpos are necessary for the survival of lp in water <cit> . based on a gfp reporter assay, we found that bdha is positively regulated by rpos following exposure to water . this is consistent with the findings of hovel-miner et al. <cit> , which show that, in a rich medium, bdha in lp is positively regulated by rpos in the post-exponential phase. CONCLUSIONS our study reveals, for the first time, the global transcriptomic changes of lp in water. repression of major pathways, such as cell division, transcription and translation, suggests that lp enters a quiescent state in water. the induction of the enhanced-entry genes and some icm/dot effectors suggests that lp may be primed to infect a suitable host. similarly, many genes involved in resistance to antibiotics and oxidative stress, as well as genes involved in the heat shock response were induced. furthermore, the bdha gene involved in the degradation pathway of the intracellular energy storage compound phb is highly expressed and positively regulated by rpos during short-term exposure to water. this gene was found to be important for maintaining long-term survival of lp in water. there is no doubt that many of the genes highly induced upon exposure to water are also necessary for the short and/or long-term survival of lp in water.",

    "prompt": "Provide a concise recap of the clinical trial results. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND sound travels as waves of compressed air into the outer ear; it is amplified by the movement of ossicles in the middle ear; and finally is converted into a neuronal signal in the inner ear. in the organ of corti, sound stimulation of the sensory \"hair\" cells leads to release of glutamate to initiate neuronal signals which are carried to and processed in the brain. the organ of corti is a specialised epithelial tissue containing three rows of outer hair cells, one row of inner hair cells and a variety of supporting cells. each hair cell is surrounded by and separated from its neighbours by intervening supporting cells. the bodies of the supporting cells also intervene between the base of the hair cells and the basilar membrane, the extracellular matrix that underlies the organ of corti, such that supporting cells, but not hair cells are attached to the basilar membrane. the base of each hair cell is in contact with a nerve terminal where the mechanical sound signal is converted into an electrical nerve signal. the cellular composition and architecture of the organ of corti is critical to its function <cit> . it has been demonstrated that both hair cells and supporting cells are derived from a common precursor <cit> . however, the mechanisms of maturation of the organ of corti are largely unknown <cit> . identification of the factors involved in the differentiation and maturation of the organ of corti is of interest not only to understand the possible cause of congenital hearing defects but also to understand why the mammalian organ of corti is unable to regenerate hair when these are killed as a consequence of the effects of damaging agents such as noise or ototoxins or with ageing <cit> . during maturation of the organ of corti, the division of precursor cells into supporting cells and a hair cells is characterised by the detachment of the precursor cells from basilar membrane during the mitotic phase and the formation of the supporting cell that re-attaches to the basilar membrane while the hair cell does not <cit> . in epithelial tissues, the attachment and detachment of cells to and from the basement membrane is known to be mediated by integrin proteins binding to extracellular matrix protein <cit> . integrins are a family of transmembrane proteins that form heterodimeric surface receptors composed of an α and β subunit <cit> . the integrin receptor heterodimers have specific affinities for extracellular proteins commonly found in the basement membrane and, upon binding, they are capable of sending signals which can determine developmental processes in the cells <cit> . there is evidence that integrins are expressed in the inner ear <cit> and that they play an important functional role as demonstrated by the effect of mutations <cit> . however, their role in the differentiation and maintenance of the organ of corti requires further investigation. in this study we have chosen to use a cell line derived from embryonic day <dig> immortomouse inner ear <cit> . this cell line has previously been demonstrated to have certain characteristics of developing inner ear epithelial cells. oc- <dig> cells can be maintained in a proliferative state at 33°c but when switched to 39°c the cells express a number of markers characteristic of mature hair cells <cit> . in this study we have investigated the expression of several integrins in oc- <dig> cells and their role in controlling the differentiation processes of oc- <dig> cells. we demonstrate that among the integrins detected in oc- <dig> cells the expression of β <dig> is directly related to the production of myosin viia, a marker of differentiated hair cells. RESULTS increased integrin expression in differentiated oc- <dig> cells to confirm that oc- <dig> cells grown at 39°c for <dig> weeks had differentiated, myosin vi and myosin viia levels were examined by western blot analysis. as has been shown previously <cit> , differentiated oc- <dig> cells increased their expression of both myosin vi and viia with respect to undifferentiated cells. facs and western blot analysis were utilized to quantify the relative changes of expression of the integrin subunits during the differentiation of oc- <dig> cells. oc- <dig> cells were screened for integrin expression and the integrin subunits α <dig> αv, β <dig> and β <dig> were detected but not α1-, α2-, α5- and β4-integrin subunits . the expression of α6-integrin subunit was not significantly different between undifferentiated and differentiated oc- <dig> cells. in contrast, αv- and β1-integrin surface levels were increased in differentiated oc- <dig> cells when compared with undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells . no expression of β3-integrin was observed in undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells but this receptor was expressed after the oc- <dig> cells had undergone differentiation . similar results were obtained when total protein levels of these integrin subunits were examined by western blot analysis . to verify our in vitro findings, rt-pcr for the integrin subunits α <dig> αv, β <dig> β <dig> and β <dig> was performed on rna isolated from cochlear tissue of adult mice . all integrin subunits examined were expressed in mouse cochlear tissue, to varying levels, apart from β4-integrin, which also was not expressed on oc- <dig> cells. time course of integrin expression profiles during differentiation having shown that differentiated oc- <dig> cells had increased expression of αv, β <dig> and β3-integrin, we analysed the pattern of integrin expression over the <dig> day differentiation period. oc- <dig> cells, cultured at 33°c, were transferred to 39°c and integrin expression was examined every <dig> days for <dig> days, when the cells had fully differentiated. unsurprisingly, α6-integrin levels did not alter during the <dig> day differentiation period . αv-integrin expression levels remained similar to levels seen at 33°c cells for the first <dig> days during differentiation. by day <dig> of differentiation, αv-integrin expression levels increased to the levels observed in fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells , and remained so until oc- <dig> cells were fully differentiated . however, we did observe that at day <dig> of differentiation, the level of αv-integrin expression was increased to a level above that found in fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells. β1-integrin expression increased from day <dig> of differentiation when compared with undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells. β1-integrin levels gradually increased until day <dig> at which time β1-integrin surface expression was comparable to levels observed in fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells . it was noted that throughout the early stages of differentiation , a small population of differentiating oc- <dig> cells expressed β1-integrin at a level comparable with fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells. no surface expression of β3-integrin was seen during the first <dig> days of the differentiation process, but by day <dig> expression of this integrin increased with time, reaching the level of expression observed in differentiated oc- <dig> cells by day <dig> . western blot analysis of all the described integrin subunits showed similar patterns of integrin expression during the differentiation process, while the increase in myosin viia and myosin vi that occurs with differentiation started being evident from day <dig> and day <dig> respectively . functional correlation between integrin expression and myosin viia levels having shown that changes in the integrin expression profiles during differentiation coincided with changes in myosin vi and myosin viia levels, we wished to confirm a functional role for these integrins in this process. fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells were transfected with sirna targeted specifically to either αv-, α6-, β1- or β3-integrin subunits or a scrambled control sirna, followed by analysis of myosin viia levels. we optimised the time of maximum effect of sirna on the respective protein surface expression and confirmed sirna treatment had no effect on cell proliferation and was non-toxic to the cells . western blot analysis showed that sirna inhibition of all integrin subunits significantly reduced the level of expression of myosin viia in comparison with fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells, to levels similar to those observed in undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells . myosin viia levels were decreased most effectively in the presence of αv and β3-integrin sirna . to investigate the specificity of action of the integrin subunits we have measured the effect of some of the integrin sirna on the expression of other integrin subunits. all integrin sirnas, but not scrambled sirnas significantly reduced the surface expression of their respective proteins and in some cases also other integrins. for example β3-sirna caused a significant reduction of surface expression of β <dig> αv, β <dig> but not α <dig> other examples of non-significant effect of sirnas were α6-sirnaand αv-sirna on β <dig> expression . these data indicate that the effect of the sirnas is specific but there is interdependency in the surface expression of different integrin subunits. having shown that β3-integrin diplayed the most dramatic change in integrin expression during madifferentiation of the oc <dig> cells and that knockdown of this integrin was the most effective at reducing the expression of myosin viia, we over expressed β3-integrin in undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells to generate a phenotype similar to fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells. retroviral transduction of undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells with human β3-integrin was confirmed by facs analysis and showed surface expression levels similar to those observed in fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells. this over expression of β3-integrin, in turn, increased the expression of myosin viia to levels similar to those in fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells. indeed, myosin viia levels were increased significantly in transduced cells when compared with undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells. the effect of over expression of human β3-integrin on other integrin expression patterns was examined by facs analysis. α6-integrin surface levels did not change in response to increased β3-integrin, whereas αv-integrin, and, to a lesser extent, β1-integrin showed increased surface expression after transduction with human β3-integrin . discussion in this study we have utilised the oc- <dig> cell line to study the role of integrin proteins in the regulation of differentiation of this cell line. the oc- <dig> cells display only some of the characteristics of the cells of the organ of corti from where they have been derived. however, they do have a temporal pattern of gene expression that reflects the developmental processes observed in the organ of corti. therefore we believe the findings reported here can be considered of significance for the understanding of the maturation and/or regeneration processes of the organ of corti. in this study we have observed in differentiating oc <dig> cells a differential pattern of developmental expression of integrin subunits ranging from no change as in α <dig> to an increase from sub-detectable levels to higher levels for β <dig> other variations included a peak of αv expression at day <dig> above the level of the fully differentiated cells and the presence of a sub-population of differentiating cells with high β <dig> expression. taken as a whole these expression patterns indicate a complex relationship between integrin expression and the differentiation of oc <dig> cells. in this study we have began to unravel this complexity by establishing a temporal and functional relationship between the expression of integrins and the expression of the mature hair cell markers . this study did not aim to identify all the possible integrins that are expressed by oc- <dig> and it is plausible that other integrins may also be expressed and affect differentiation of oc- <dig> cells. our interest was directed at verifying our hypothesis that the expression of some integrins can be functionally correlated to the expression of hair cell differentiation markers. our data demonstrate at least one integrin subunit plays such role in the expression of the hair cell differentiation marker myosin viia. expression of β <dig> integrin appears to be both necessary, as demonstrated by the decrease of expression of myosin viia in differentiated oc- <dig> cells exposed to β3-sirna, and sufficient as indicated by the expression of myosin viia in undifferentiated cells virally transfected with β3-integrin gene. our sirna data and β3-transfections data also indicate that the expression of one integrin subunit can affect the surface expression of other integrins subunits. the specificity of this latter effect is substantiated by the fact that scrambled sirna did not affect the expression of any integrin subunits and some integrin sirna did not inhibit the expression of specific integrins . a full investigation of all the respective inhibitory effects of integrin sirna on other integrin subunits was not within the scope of this study. however, of our data does suggest that this would be a worthwhile aim. the transcriptional expression of one integrin subunit could affect the surface expression of another integrin by a number of mechanisms ranging from transcriptional regulation of gene expression to post-translation modulation of integrin receptor assembly. the β <dig> subunit predominantly dimerises with αv to form a functional integrin receptor <cit> ; further studies would be required to establish whether the β <dig> subunit competes with other beta subunits to dimerise with αv, or whether the observed increase in αv is sufficient to form additional functional dimers with β <dig> interaction between integrins and cytoskeletal proteins, including myosins, has been reported in several systems including the inner ear <cit> . what is of particular interest with respect to the organ of corti is that the differentiation of the precursors of hair cells and supporting cells involves detachment from the basilar membrane which is composed of extracellular matrix proteins recognised by integrin complexes <cit> . the data described in this paper, if confirmed in the organ of corti, would help to elucidate a central mechanism of the developmental processes of the inner ear and may lead to a better understanding of the lack of regeneration of inner ear tissue following injury. the oc- <dig> cells represent a good model for testing some of the potential mechanism of integrin involvement in hair cells development. however to more faithfully mimic the events that occur in vivo it would also be necessary to reproduce the changes in extracellular proteins that have been shown to occur in the organ of corti during development <cit> . while our data demonstrate a clear link between integrin expression and oc- <dig> cell differentiation, it would be premature to utilise our data to speculate on the exact mechanisms of the development of hair cells. to better understand the differentiation mechanisms that take place in the oc- <dig> cells, further work will be conducted to elucidate the relationship between integrin subunit expression and other hair cell markers such as the alpha <dig> subunit of the acetylcholine receptor <cit> as well as other signalling proteins known to be associated with integrins <cit> . ultimately, it will be necessary to demonstrate that the developmental mechanisms observed in oc <dig> cells also take place in the organ of corti. CONCLUSIONS we have demonstrated that in oc- <dig> cells there is causal relationship between β3- integrin expression and the expression of the hair cell differentiation marker myosin viia. these data could reflect similar events occurring during the development of the organ of corti.",

    "prompt": "What are the main diagnoses or treatments mentioned here? ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND p. aeruginosa, a gram-negative bacterium, is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis <cit> . in cf, p. aeruginosa is often isolated from sputum samples and exhibits a phenotype called mucoidy, which is due to overproduction of an exopolysaccharide called alginate. it is also an environmental bacterium which normally does not overproduce alginate <cit> . the emergence of mucoid p. aeruginosa isolates in cf sputum specimens signifies the onset of chronic respiratory infections. mucoidy plays an important role in the pathogenesis of p. aeruginosa infections in cf, which includes, but is not limited to: increased resistance to antibiotics <cit> , increased resistance to phagocytic killing <cit> and assistance in evading the host’s immune response <cit> . a major pathway for the conversion to mucoidy in p. aeruginosa is dependent upon algu , an alternative sigma factor that drives transcription of algd encoding the key enzyme for alginate biosynthesis <cit> . previous studies have shown that several genes take part in the regulation of algu activation and alginate overproduction. muca is a trans-membrane protein that negatively regulates mucoidy by acting as an anti-sigma factor via sequestering algu to the cytoplasmic membrane <cit> ; mucb and intra-membrane proteases algw, mucp and clpxp were reported to affect alginate production by affecting the stability of muca <cit> . a small envelope protein called muce was found to be a positive regulator for mucoid conversion in p. aeruginosa strains with a wild type muca <cit> . the mechanism for muce induced mucoidy is due to its c-terminal –wvf signal, which can activate the protease algw possibly by interaction with the pdz domain <cit> . upon activation, algw initiates the proteolytic degradation of the periplasmic portion of muca, causing the release of algu to drive expression of the alginate biosynthetic operon <cit> . while the function of muce as an alginate inducer was identified, its physiological role, and its role in the regulation of mucoidy in clinical isolates, remains unknown. comparative analysis through basic local alignment search tool using the genomes of pseudomonas species from the public databases reveals that muce orthologues are found only in the strains of p. aeruginosa <cit> . in order to study the role and regulation of muce in p. aeruginosa, we first mapped the muce transcriptional start site. we then examined the effect of five different sigma factors on the expression of muce in vivo. different cell wall stress agents were tested for the induction of muce transcription. expression of muce was also analyzed in non-mucoid cf isolates to determine its ability to induce alginate overproduction. methods bacteria strains, plasmids, and growth conditions bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> e. coli strains were grown at 37°c in luria broth or lb agar. p. aeruginosa strains were grown at 37°c in lb or on pseudomonas isolation agar plates . when required, carbenicillin, tetracycline or gentamicin were added to the growth media. the concentration of carbenicillin, tetracycline or gentamycin was added at the following concentrations: for lb broth or plates <dig> μg ml- <dig> <dig> μg ml- <dig> or <dig> μg ml- <dig> respectively. the concentration of carbenicillin, tetracycline or gentamycin to the pia plates was <dig> μg ml- <dig> <dig> μg ml- <dig> or <dig> μg ml- <dig> respectively. the muce primer extension assay total rna was isolated from p. aeruginosa pao <dig> grown to an od <dig> of <dig> in <dig> ml lb at 37°c as previously described <cit> . the total rna was isolated using the rneasy kit per the manufacturer’s instructions. primers for muce , seq <dig> and seq <dig> , were radio-labeled using t <dig> polynucleotide kinase and γp32-atp. primer extensions were performed using the thermoscript rt-pcr system with either pa <dig> seq <dig> or seq <dig> with 10– <dig> μg of total rna. extensions were performed at 55°c for an hour. primer extension products then were electrophoresed through a 6% acrylamide/8m urea gel along with sequencing reactions using the same primers used in the extension reactions. transformation and conjugation e. coli one shot top <dig> cells were transformed via standard heat shock method according to the supplier’s instructions. plasmid transfer from e. coli to pseudomonas was performed via triparental conjugations using the helper plasmid prk <dig> <cit> . generating pao <dig> minictx-pmuce-lacz reporter strain pao <dig> genomic dna was used as a template to amply <dig> bp upstream of the start site of muce using two primers with built-in restriction sites, hindiii-muce-p-f and ecori-muce-p-r: . the pmuce amplicon was topo cloned and digested with hindiii and ecori restriction enzymes before ligating into the promoterless pseudomonas integration vector minictx-lacz. the promoter fusion construct minictx-pmuce-lacz was integrated onto the p. aeruginosa chromosome of strain pao <dig> at the ctx phage att site <cit> following triparental conjugation with e. coli containing the prk <dig> helper plasmid <cit> . screening for a panel of chemical agents that can promote pmuce transcription membrane disrupters and antibiotics were first tested by serial dilution to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration for strain pao1::attb::pmuce-lacz. an arbitrary sub-mic concentration for each compound was then tested for the induction effect through the color change of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside ). the final concentration of the compounds used in this study are listed as follows: triclosan <dig> μg/ml, tween- <dig> <dig> % , hydrogen peroxide <dig> %, sodium hypochlorite <dig> %, sds <dig> %, ceftazidimine <dig> μg/ml, tobramycin <dig> μg/ml, gentamicin <dig> μg/ml, colisitin <dig> μg/ml, and amikacin <dig> μg/ml. pao1::attb::pmuce-lacz was cultured overnight in <dig> ml lb broth, <dig> μl of overnight culture and <dig> μl of 4% x-gal was added to each treatment culture tube . the cultures were grown overnight at 37°c with shaking at <dig> rpm and were used to visually observe the change of the color. lb broth lacking x-gal was used as a negative control. the β-galactosidase activity assay pseudomonas strains were cultured at 37°c on three pia plates. after <dig> hours, bacterial cells were harvested and re-suspended in pbs. the od <dig> was measured and adjusted to approximately <dig> . cells were then permeabilized using toluene, and β-galactosidase activity was measured at od <dig> and od <dig> the results in miller units were calculated according to this formula: miller units = 1000 × / <cit> . the reported values represent an average of three independent experiments with standard error. alginate assay p. aeruginosa strains were grown at 37°c on pia plates in triplicate for <dig> hrs or <dig> hrs. the bacteria were collected and re-suspended in pbs. the od <dig> was analyzed for the amount of uronic acid in comparison with a standard curve made with d-mannuronic acid lactone , as previously described <cit> . itraq® maldi tof/tof proteome analysis strains pao <dig> ve <dig> and ve2Δalgu were cultured on pia plates for <dig> hrs at 37°c. protein preparation and itraq mass spectrometry analysis was performed according to previously described methods <cit> . RESULTS mapping of the muce promoter in pao1 we previously identified muce, a small envelope protein, which induces mucoid conversion in p. aeruginosa when overexpressed <cit> . induction of muce activates the intramembrane protease algw resulting in activation of the cytoplasmic sigma factor algu and conversion from nonmucoidy to mucoidy in strains with a wild type muca <cit> . stable production of copious amounts of alginate is characteristic of strain ve <dig> which carries a mariner transposon insertion before muce <cit> . this insertion is likely responsible for the constitutive expression of the muce gene <cit> . however, it is unclear how muce is naturally expressed in parent pao <dig> to determine this, primer extension analysis of the muce promoter region was performed. with higher amounts of pao <dig> rna , we observed one prominent transcriptional start site that is initiated <dig> nucleotides upstream of the muce translational start site . this suggests that, under these conditions, muce has one promoter that is active in pao <dig> the alternative sigma factor algu activates transcription of muce in vivo in order to determine which sigma factor is responsible for driving muce transcription, minictx-pmuce-lacz was integrated onto the pao <dig> chromosome. to identify the sigma factor that activates the expression of pmuce, we expressed p. aeruginosa sigma factors in trans and measured pmuce-lacz activity in this pao <dig> fusion strain. as seen in figure <dig> miller assay results showed that algu significantly increased the promoter activity of pmuce in pao <dig> however, we did not observe any significant increases in promoter activity of pmuce with other sigma factors tested in this study. as stated earlier, algu is a sigma factor that controls the promoter of the alginate biosynthetic gene algd <cit> . in order to determine whether the activity of pmuce is elevated in mucoid strains, plp170-pmuce was conjugated into mucoid laboratory and clinical p. aeruginosa strains. as seen in figures 3a and 3b, the activity of pmuce increased in mucoid laboratory and cf isolates. cell wall stress promotes expression of muce from pmuce since the muce promoter was active in nonmucoid pao <dig> and further increased in mucoid cells , the conditions that induce muce expression were examined. to do this, we used the same pmuce-lacz strain of pao <dig> to measure the activation of muce by some compounds previously shown to cause cell wall perturbations <cit> . the phenotypes of strains harboring the pmuce-lacz fusion in the presence of various cell wall stress agents are shown in figure 4a. while sodium hypochlorite and colistin didn’t induce a visual change in pmuce activity, three compounds, triclosan, sodium dodecyl sulfate and ceftazidime induced marked expression of pmuce-lacz in pao <dig> each resulted in elevated levels of β-galactosidase activity as indicated by the blue color of the growth media. this suggests that the pmuce promoter activity was increased in response to these stimuli . miller assays were performed to measure the changes in pmuce-lacz activity due to these compounds. triclosan increased pmuce-lacz activity by almost 3-fold over lb alone . an increase in pmuce-lacz should increase palgu-lacz activity. as expected, triclosan caused a 5-fold increase in palgu-lacz activity. however, sds and ceftazidime increased the pmuce-lacz activity, but did not promote the palgu-lacz activity . alginate production is reduced in the muce mutant compared to pao1 expression of muce can cause alginate overproduction <cit> . however, we wondered if muce would affect transcriptional activity at palgu and palgd promoters. in order to determine this, both plp170-palgu and plp170-palgd with each promoter fused to a promoterless lacz gene were conjugated into pao <dig> and pao1ve <dig> respectively. as seen in additional file 1: figure s <dig> the activity of palgu and palgd was significantly increased in the muce over-expressed strain pao1ve <dig> although, qiu et al. <cit> have reported that algu is required for muce induced mucoidy, we wanted to know whether muce is required for algu induced mucoidy. as seen in additional file 1: figure s <dig> we did not observe that the over-expression of muce induced mucoidy in pao1Δalgu. this result is consistent with what was previously reported by qiu et al. <cit> . however, the alginate production induced by algu was decreased in the muce knockout strain. the alginate production induced by algu in two isogenic strains, pao <dig> and pao1muce::isphoa/hah is <dig> ± <dig> and <dig> ± <dig> μg/ml/od <dig> respectively . these results indicate that alginate overproduction in pao <dig> does not require muce. however, muce can promote the activity of algu resulting in a higher level of alginate production in pao <dig> compared to the muce knockout. previously, boucher et al. <cit> and suh et al. <cit> have reported that sigma factors rpon and rpos were involved in alginate regulation. in order to determine whether muce induced mucoidy was also dependent on other sigma factors besides algu, pherd20t-muce was conjugated and over-expressed in pao1Δrpon, pao1rpos::islacz/hah and pao1rpof::isphoa/hah. the results showed that the muce induction caused mucoid conversion in pao1rpos::islacz/hah and pao1rpof::isphoa/hah when <dig> % l-arabinose was added to the media. however, <dig> % l-arabinose was required for mucoid conversion in pao1Δrpon. the alginate production induced by muce in pao1rpos::islacz/hah, pao1rpof::isphoa/hah and pao1Δrpon is <dig> ± <dig> , <dig> ± <dig> and <dig> ± <dig> μg/ml/od <dig> respectively. these results suggested that rpon, rpos and rpof are not required for muce-induced mucoidy in pao <dig> conversely, over-expression of these sigma factors rpod, rpon, rpos and rpof did not induce mucoid conversion in pao <dig> when the strains of pao <dig> with sigma factor overexpression were measured for alginate production, the level is as follows: <dig> ± <dig> , <dig> ± <dig> , <dig> ± <dig> and <dig> ± <dig> μg/ml/od <dig> muce-induced mucoidy in clinical cf isolates is based on two factors, size of muca and genotype of algu although, qiu et al. <cit> have reported that over-expression of muce can induce mucoidy in laboratory strains pao <dig> and pa <dig> its ability to induce mucoidy in clinical cf isolates has not been investigated. particularly, muce’s relationship to muca mutations is unknown since different mutations would result in production of muca with various molecular masses. to test if the length of muca had an effect on muce-mediated mucoid induction, we selected a group of nonmucoid clinical isolates and observed any phenotypic change after overexpression of muce. figure <dig> summarizes the results. first, strains with wild type algu and muca became mucoid. although, muca of cf <dig> carries a missense mutation, cf <dig> became mucoid. secondly, as seen in figure <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> muce could induce mucoidy in cf <dig> and cf <dig> with wild type algu, but not in strains containing algu carrying a missense mutation . thirdly, overexpression of muce did not induce mucoidy in cf <dig> and cf <dig> whose muca length was 117aa, despite a wild type algu in cf <dig> these results suggest that muce-mediated mucoidy is dependent on the combination of two factors, muca length and algu genotype . the effect of muce on mucoid induction is more obvious in strains with muca length up to <dig> amino acid residues coupled with wild type algu, but missense mutations in algu can significantly reduce the potency of muce. mutant algus display partial activity resulting in decreased amount of alginate schurr et al. have reported that second-site suppressor mutations in algu can affect mucoidy <cit> . devries and ohman <cit> also reported that mucoid-to-nonmucoid conversion in alginate-producing p. aeruginosa is often due to spontaneous mutations in algt . recently, damkiaer et al. <cit> showed that point mutations can result in a partially active algu. to test whether the activity of algu from different cf isolates is affected due to mutation, the cf <dig> and cf <dig> algu genes were cloned and over-expressed in pao1Δalgu and pao1minictx-palgd-lacz, respectively. as seen in figure <dig> these constructs retained the ability to promote the transcription of palgd and alginate production. also, when transposon libraries were screened for mucoid revertants in cf <dig> <cit> and frd <dig> three and five mucoid mutants in cf <dig> and frd <dig> respectively, were identified due to transposon insertion before algu causing the overexpression of algu . however, the activity of the mutant algu is lower than that of wild type algu . in order to determine whether the mutant algu still has the ability to promote muce transcription, algu genes from cf <dig> and cf <dig> were cloned into pherd20t, respectively, and over-expressed in pao <dig> minictx-pmuce-lacz strain. as seen in figure <dig> mutant forms of algu were still able to promote muce transcription, albeit at a reduced level. characterization of the muce regulon using itraq analysis in order to determine the effect of muce expression on the proteome change, we performed itraq proteome analysis via maldi tof/tof. total protein lysates of pao <dig> ve <dig> and ve2Δalgu were collected and analyzed. within the three samples, <dig> unique proteins were identified with <dig> peptides assayed at/or above 95% confidence. the data set was then filtered to include only proteins that were significantly different between samples and the number of the detected peptides for each protein more than three . by comparing the proteomes of ve <dig> to pao <dig> the effects of increased muce levels on pao <dig> were examined; while comparing ve2Δalgu to pao <dig> allowed for the determination of algu-independent protein production in ve <dig> as seen in additional file 1: table s <dig> compared to pao <dig> <dig> proteins were differentially expressed due to muce over-expression, and two of them are algu-independent. discussion muce is a small envelope protein whose overexpression can promote alginate overproduction in p. aeruginosa strains with a wild type muca <cit> . here, we observed that algu can induce the expression from pmuce, and consistent with this result, the pmuce activity is higher in mucoid strains than in non-mucoid strains . algu is a stress-related alternate sigma factor that is auto-regulated from its multiple promoters <cit> . as a sigma factor, algu drives transcription of the alginate biosynthetic gene algd <cit> and the alginate regulator gene algr <cit> . as shown in this study, algu can also activate the transcription of muce, and subsequently, depending on the level of induction, muce can increase palgu and palgd activity resulting in mucoid conversion in clinical strains. together, these results suggest a positive feedback mechanism of action in which algu activates muce expression at the pmuce promoter, and in return, the increased level of muce can increase algu activity by activating algw, which further degrades muca . this regulation between muce and algu probably ensures that a cell, upon exposure to stress, can rapidly reach the desired level of algu and alginate production. therefore, it is not surprising to see that a higher level of alginate production requires muce in p. aeruginosa strains with a wild type muca . we also noted that some cell wall stress agents, like triclosan and sds can induce the expression of muce. however, the differential activation at palgu by triclosan but not sds suggests sds may not be an inducer at palgu, and/or the stimulation by sds was not high enough to initiate the positive feedback regulation of muce by algu. nevertheless, this observation is consistent with what was previously reported by wood et al. regarding the absence of induction at palgd by sds <cit> . furthermore, we found that strain pao <dig> does not become mucoid when cultured on lb or pia plates supplemented with triclosan or sds at the concentration as used in figure <dig> . qiu et al. have reported that muce can induce alginate overproduction when over-expressed in vivo <cit> . however, nothing was known about the regulation of muce. recently, the genome-wide transcriptional start sites of many genes were mapped by rna-seq in p. aeruginosa strain pa <dig> <cit> . however, the transcriptional start site of the muce gene was not included. in this study, we reported the mapping of the muce transcriptional start site. furthermore, we found the transcription of muce is dependent on algu. analysis of the upstream region of muce reveals an algu promoter-like sequence . previously, firoved et al. identified <dig> genes in the algu regulon, based on scanning for algu promoter consensus sequence in the pao <dig> genome <cit> . in this study, we found that algu can activate the transcription of muce. in order to determine whether algu can bind to pmuce region, algu was purified and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed. as seen in additional file 1: figure s <dig> our results showed that algu affected the mobility of pmuce dna, especially in the presence of e. coli rna polymerase core enzyme, suggesting a direct binding of algu to pmuce. however, whether small regulatory rnas or other unknown regulator proteins are also involved in the transcriptional regulation of muce needs further study. lptf is another example of an algu-dependent gene, but doesn’t have the consensus sequence in the promoter region <cit> . while muce, as a small envelope protein is positively regulated through a feedback mechanism, it’s not clear how many algu-regulated genes follow the same pattern of regulation as muce. the muca mutation is a major mechanism for the conversion to mucoidy. mutation can occur throughout the muca gene <cit> . these mutations result in the generation of muca proteins of different sizes. for example, unlike the wild type muca with <dig> amino acid residues, muca <dig> which is produced due to a frameshift mutation, results in a protein containing the n-terminal <dig> amino acids of muca, fused with a stretch of <dig> amino acids without homology to any known protein sequence <cit> . muca <dig> lacks the trans-membrane domain of wild type muca, predicting a cytoplasmic localization. therefore, different muca mutations could possibly result in different cellular compartment localization. identification of muce’s function as an inducer of alginate in strains with wild type muca and algu strongly suggests muce acts through interaction with algw in the periplasm. on the other hand, the loss of this predicted muca-algw interaction can be seen in two strains, cf <dig> and cf <dig> which lack the major cleavage site of algw <cit> . interestingly, we observed that the missense mutation in algu can reduce, but not completely abolish, the activity of algu as an activator for alginate production. this data may explain why mutant algu alleles have reduced pmuce activity . furthermore, since algu is an auto-regulated protein <cit> , this may explain why the pmuce activity induced by mutant algu is lower than that of wild type algu. a slightly higher activity of pmuce noted in cf <dig> than in pao1ve <dig> could be due to a combined effect of dual mutation of algu and muca in cf <dig> in strains of frd <dig> and cf <dig> the retention of the algw cleavage site is not sufficient to restore mucoidy. this is because of the partial function of algu, which can be seen with alginate production and algu-dependent palgd promoter activity . altogether, these results suggest that mucoidy in clinical isolates can be modulated by a combination of two factors, the size of the muca protein and the genotype of the algu allele in a particular strain. muca size determines its cellular localization and its ability to sequester algu, and the algu allele determines whether algu is fully or partially active. the itraq results showed that the expression of two proteins was significantly increased and the expression of nine proteins was decreased in the muce over-expressed strain ve <dig> . of these <dig> proteins, nine of them are algu dependent, for including flagellin type b. garrett et al. previously reported that algu can negatively regulate flagellin type b and repress flagella expression <cit> . however, no algu consensus promoter sequences were found within the upstream of the <dig> regulated genes through bioinformatics analysis, indicating that these may be indirect effect. in addition, two proteins were significantly decreased when compared to pao <dig> proteome, but remained unchanged when comparison was made between ve <dig> and ve2Δalgu, suggesting the reduction of these two proteins was independent of algu in the muce over-expressed strain. mvat is a global regulator of virulence in p. aeruginosa <cit> , and elongation factor tu is important for growth and translation. elongation factor tu has also been shown to act as a chaperone in e. coli, consistent with induction of proteins involved in responding to heat or other protein damaging stresses <cit> . recently, elongation factor tu has been shown to have a unique post-translational modification that has roles in colonization of the respiratory tract <cit> . the differential expression of tu due to muce overexpression suggests there may be signaling networks dependent upon muce that we have not yet been identified. although, previous studies have shown that the growth rate is slower in mucoid strains and the virulence is increased after deleting algu <cit> , the relationship between muce and growth or virulence need further study. together, itraq analysis suggests that muce signaling affected both algu-dependent and algu-independent protein expression. CONCLUSIONS the alternative sigma factor algu was responsible for muce transcription. together, our results suggest there is a positive feedback regulation of muce by algu in p. aeruginosa, and the expression of muce can be induced by exposure to certain cell wall stress agents, suggesting that muce may be part of the signal transduction that senses the cell wall stress to p. aeruginosa. authors’ contributions yy designed, performed the experiments, and drafted the manuscript; fhd, trw and clp performed the experiments and revised the manuscript; xw and mjs revised the manuscript; hdy designed the experiments and revised the manuscript. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. supplementary material additional file 1 supplementary materials and methods. click here for file acknowledgements this work was supported by the national aeronautics and space administration west virginia space grant consortium and the cystic fibrosis foundation . f.h.d. was supported by grants from the nasa graduate student researchers program , nasa west virginia space grant consortium, and a post-doctoral fellowship from the cystic fibrosis foundation . t.r.w. was supported through the nasa wvsgc graduate research fellowship. h.d.y. was supported by nih p20rr <dig> and p20gm <dig> to the west virginia idea network for biomedical research excellence.",

RESULTS minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations of boswellic acids the in vitro antibacterial activities of boswellic acids were tested on a group of clinically significant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria . akba was the most active of the four boswellic acids against the bacterial pathogens. however the activity of akba was limited to gram-positive bacteria only as its mic was > <dig> μg/ml against escherichia coli atcc <dig> and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc <dig> . akba exhibited mic ranging from 2- <dig> μg/ml against all the gram-positive clinical isolates tested, whereas 11-keto-β-boswellic acid and β-boswellic acid exhibited moderate gram-positive antibacterial activity . acetyl-β-boswellic acid on the other hand was completely devoid of antibacterial activity upto the tested concentration of <dig> μg/ml. all the compounds were bacteriostatic in nature and exhibited an mbc > <dig> μg/ml. since akba was found to be the most active boswellic acid compound against gram-positive bacterial pathogens, further in vitro studies were performed on this compound against clinically important s. aureus and s. epidermidis. mics and mbcs of boswellic acid molecules were determined using clsi guidelines against <dig> clinical isolates including atcc strains. aminimum inhibitory concentration ; bminimum bactericidal concentration ; ci = clinical isolates; n = number of clinical isolates. postantibiotic effect the pae of akba was determined on s. aureus atcc <dig> . the pae induced by akba was concentration dependent, with duration <dig> ± <dig> h at <dig> × mic while at <dig> × mic it was <dig> ± <dig> h. ciprofloxacin was used as control drug in the study and it exhibited a pae of <dig> ± <dig> h at <dig> × mic while at <dig> × mic it was <dig> ± <dig> h . the paes of akba were significantly higher than the ciprofloxacin against s. aureus . the paes were monitored by viable count of s. aureus after <dig> h exposure to concentrations equal to mic and <dig> × mic of antimicrobials . values in the same column followed by the same superscripts are significantly different from each other . pae, post antibiotic effect. time-kill kinetic studies the time-kill kinetic studies of akba were performed on s. aureus atcc <dig> . it showed bacteriostatic activity at all the tested concentrations. the maximum effect of akba was observed at <dig> and <dig> μg/ml exhibiting a ≈ <dig> log <dig> reduction in the viability of s. aureus cells when compared with non treated controls at four and eight times it's mic over a period of <dig> h study. biofilm inhibition and reduction akba effectively inhibited the formation of s. aureus and s. epidermidis biofilms, with 50% biofilm inhibition concentration from 16- <dig> μg/ml which is in the range of <dig> × mic and <dig> × mic respectively. akba also effectively eradicated the preformed biofilms. the 50% biofilm reduction concentration ranged from 32- <dig> μg/ml for both the bacterial isolates . effect of akba on membrane integrity in order to investigate the antibacterial action of akba on the bacterial membrane integrity, the cell suspension of s. aureus atcc <dig> was exposed to a concentration of <dig> μg/ml akba for <dig> and <dig> min followed by staining with propidium iodide . the akba exposure resulted in bacterial cell membrane disruption as evident from the increased uptake of propidium iodide in comparison to the unexposed cells . in addition, the membrane leakage assay illustrated the cytoplasmic membrane damage of s. aureus. the amount of <dig> and <dig> nm absorbing material in s. aureus cell supernatants treated with akba was <dig> and 15% at <dig> min while it was <dig> and 19% at <dig> min respectively , which was significantly higher than the untreated control . discussion and CONCLUSIONS the gum exudate or the resin obtained from the bark of boswellia serrata has been widely used by the practitioners of the indian systems of medicine for various medical conditions such as arthritis, asthma, ulcers, and skin diseases; currently it is being extensively used in various formulations for the treatment of inflammation related disorders <cit> . the major chemical components of gum resin can be divided into three groups: volatile oils or lower terpenoids, higher terpenoids, and carbohydrates. the higher terpenoids comprises of β-boswellic acids as the main triterpenic acid along with 11-keto-β-boswellic acids and their acetates <cit> . the in vitro antibacterial activity results of four boswellic acid compounds revealed akba to be the most potent antibacterial compound against gram-positive pathogens, but it showed no significant antibacterial activity against the gram negative bacteria. akba exerted bacteriostatic antibacterial activity against s. aureus atcc <dig> and exhibited a good pae of <dig> h at <dig> × mic concentration. staphylococci cause a large percentage of catheter associated infections, and like many other pathogens, rather than living as free planktonic cells within the host they tend to form a multilayered community of sessile bacterial cells known as a biofilm on medical implants or damaged tissue <cit> . biofilm infections are difficult to treat due to their inherent antibiotic resistance <cit> . akba effectively inhibited the staphylococcal biofilm and also reduced the preformed biofilm of these bacterial pathogens . to our knowledge, this is the first report to provide the evidence that akba can prevent as well as reduce the s. aureus and s. epidermidis generated biofilms. akba is reported to be active against a large number of inflammatory diseases, cancer, arthritis, chronic colitis, ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease, and bronchial asthma <cit> . the anticancer activity of akba is attributed to the inhibitory effect on the lipoxygenases leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in tumor cells <cit> . there are numerous reports available on the antibacterial activity of oleo-gum resin extracts and oleo-gum resin essential oils from boswellia spp. <cit> . weckessera et al. <cit> reported the antibacterial activity of boswellia dry extract and keto-ß-boswellic acid. their findings revealed that the extract was highly effective against selected aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as streptococcus, corynebacteria, c. perfringens and p. acnes; whereas kba was not effective against these pathogens, suggesting that the effective components are other boswellic acids or essential oils contained in the extract. in this study, we extensively evaluated the boswellic acids for the antibacterial activity and further for the first time established that akba is the single most potent antibacterial compound present in the gum exudates of boswellia serrata. we further investigated the effect of akba on the bacterial cell membrane integrity through propidium iodide uptake assay. propidium iodide is fluorescent nucleic acid stain that binds to dna by intercalating between the bases with little or no sequence preference. it is membrane impermeant and generally excluded from viable cells. the increased uptake of propidium iodide in the akba treated cells of s aureus in our study indicated that akba altered the cell membrane structure, resulting in the disruption of the permeability barrier of microbial membrane structures. leakage of cytosolic constituents from s. aureus cells in the presence <dig> μg/ml akba over a period of two h was significantly higher than background levels . these observations indicate that the antimicrobial activity of akba results from its ability to disrupt the permeability barrier of microbial membrane structures. the lack of antibacterial activity of akba against gram-negative bacteria may be attributed due to the presence of lipophilic outer membrane. this outer layer of the gram-negative outer membrane is composed primarily of lipopolysaccharide molecules and forms a hydrophilic permeability barrier providing protection against the effects of highly hydrophobic compounds <cit> . this may be the probable explanation of the resistance of gram-negative bacteria to lipophilic akba. similar observations have been made in other studies also, where lipohilic terpenes such as carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, geraniol, linalyl acetate, menthol and bakuchiol have reported low sensitivities against gram-negative bacteria <cit> . gum resin of boswellia is included in the list of substances generally recognized as safe , thereby permitting its use as food additive by us fda. boswellic acid extract and akba have also been reported to be safe and exert minimal toxicity on human skin cells <cit> . the recent study indicates that b. serrata is non-mutagenic in ames test, and is non-clastogenic in in vitro chromosomal aberration study <cit> . oral preparations of boswellic serrata extract containing akba are sold in the market as over the counter anti-inflammatory formulations and are considered to be quite safe <cit> . the ancient indian system of medicine claims these preparations to be safe and effective dietary supplement against joint disorders <cit> . preliminary pharmacokinetic studies carried out in humans yielded low concentrations of boswellic acids in plasma <cit> . in the study reported by buechele and simmet <cit> akba was found in plasma at a concentration of <dig> μm after the daily intake of <dig> × <dig> mg boswellia extract for <dig> days. in accordance with the observations made in humans, kba and akba were detected at a concentration of <dig> and <dig> μm, respectively; in rat plasma following single oral dose administration of <dig> mg/kg boswellia serrata extract <cit> . further attempts should be made to improve the bioavailability of akba through lipid based delivery systems. as the literature suggested that the intake of a high fat meal increases three to fivefold in the plasma concentrations of boswellic acid molecules <cit> . in addition to the above reported usage and safety associated with akba, the potent antibacterial activity reported in this study warrants that the structure of akba can be further exploited to evolve potential lead compounds in the discovery of new anti-gram-positive and anti-biofilm agents.",

    "prompt": "What are the main diagnoses or treatments mentioned here? ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND improvements in microarray fabrication and scanning technologies have enabled the production of high-density arrays that can facilitate the detection of all viral isolates, even those belonging to large, diverse families. methods have been developed to identify conserved nucleic acid regions that are common to larger groupings , thereby minimizing the number of probes required and increasing the chance of detecting novel viruses. the more recent strategies for achieving this include using pairwise sequence comparisons to identify conserved sequences for probes <cit> as well as identifying specific regions from a multiple sequence alignment <cit> . additionally, our group developed a method for designing probes within conserved protein regions <cit> . finally, oligonucleotide tiling arrays used in viral resequencing have been applied to both virus detection <cit> and viral transcript profiling <cit> . although best practices have been established for fluorescent signal analysis in expression profiling <cit> , standardization has not yet been attained for pathogen detection arrays. while low-density microarrays can be analyzed by visual inspection <cit> , high-density arrays require computational solutions. correlation of fluorescence to a predicted hybridization signal has been used to infer the presence of a virus <cit> , while a t-test based method has also been validated with the same datasets <cit> . other methods include semi-supervised classification using the k-nearest neighbor technique <cit> , an empirical determination of signal cutoffs for tiling arrays <cit> , and a likelihood metric informed by taxonomic hierarchies <cit> . resequencing arrays are able to leverage redundancy and deep-coverage, thereby helping the scientist to infer what the viral nucleotide sequence is <cit> , but whether highly divergent strains of viruses can be correctly annotated by this method is unclear. pathogen microarray data is noisy; viral signatures can be masked by cross-hybridizing host transcripts, biased template amplification, imperfectly matching probes or as the result of different probe sensitivities. additionally, only a small proportion of probes are likely to hybridize if virus is present in a sample, leading to distributions with high variance. nonparametric tests transform data into rank order or categories; this has the effect of rescaling variance and simplifying the distribution to one more easily modeled. if data variance is high or the distribution is heavily skewed, nonparametric tests are more conservative than equivalent parametric tests. what is more, nonparametric tests are valid with small sample sizes ; this is an advantage in cases where the presence of a virus is being investigated by a small number of probes. nonparametric methods such as the mann whitney u test have been applied in detecting differential gene expression of by microarrays <cit> . we compared the ability of three specific nonparametric statistical tests to predict the presence of viral agents in a hybridization experiment the three tests were the mann-whitney u, a test of central tendency; the spearman rank correlation coefficient, a measure of the relation between two variables; and the chi-square, a test of event probability based on the binomial distribution. along with negative controls, nine viral isolates from different families were hybridized; the isolates had genome sizes ranging from <dig> to <dig> kilobases. type i errors that can result from multiple testing were controlled by using the method created by j.d. storey <cit> . positive predictive value and false positive rates were used to assess the ability of the three different statistical methods to identify viruses. methods reference array design and hybridization microarrays were fabricated wherein probes were synthesized in situ in two orientations: plus and minus ; all probes were covalently anchored at the 3' end <cit> . for testing purposes, a microarray was fabricated wherein <dig> probes were deposited in both orientations and in duplicate platform gpl <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). another microarray was fabricated with a larger number of virus specific probes deposited in both orientations but singly . negative control probes were generated from <dig> randomly-chosen shuffled viral probe sequences. these probes used the same proportion of nucleotides as the viral probes, but were not homologous to any known sequences. all probes were randomly positioned on the array. to approximate clinical sample contexts yet allow for examination of a wide range of viral targets, hybridization experiments were conducted in which known concentrations of wnv viral extract were spiked into reactions containing either <dig> or <dig> nanograms of human lung tissue rna . we employed viruses that varied in genome type and length to assess the sensitivity and specificity of three methods for statistically analyzing viral microarray data. the data pool included three single-stranded positive sense rna viruses: west nile virus , sars coronavirus , and human echovirus <dig> ; two segmented single-stranded negative sense rna viruses: lassa virus and influenza a virus h1n <dig> ; two non-segmented single-stranded negative sense rna viruses: zaire ebolavirus and vesicular stomatitis virus ; and two double-stranded dna viruses: human adenovirus <dig> and human herpesvirus <dig> . after both random amplification and dendrimer labeling <cit> were completed, the arrays were visualized with an agilent slide scanner. spss version <dig> http://www.spss.com was used for statistical analysis and data plotting. computation of probe-target characteristics a database of probe-virus target homologies was created for use in our analysis algorithms. the embl viral nucleotide sequence database <cit> was filtered for short hiv- <dig> sequences and combined with the ncbi viral reference-sequence database <cit> . a non-redundant database of <dig> sequences was generated with cd-hit <cit> , using a similarity cutoff of 98% to define sequences as identical. all probe sequences were compared to the non-redundant set of viral sequences; the number and position of any mismatches was stored for each probe-virus target pair. change in gibbs free energy at 65°c was calculated as a measure of probe-target binding strength <cit> , a table of values is available in geo series gse <dig> the Δg of probe-reverse complement hybrids was also calculated; probes with higher gc content had a greater Δg. a lowess fit of probe-reverse complement Δg and the fluorescent signal was computed for all hybridizations and used to correct for sequence composition <cit> . closely related viruses may have indistinguishable hybridization profiles . we identified a set of viral sequence records likely to be distinguishable by the array. using the Δg values, we computed an in silico hybridization profile and used it to compute distances <cit> . a cut-off of - <dig> kj was used to determine whether a probe was likely to hybridize. in silico hybridization profiles that differed by less than <dig> probes were consolidated. cross validation with a public dataset to assess the applicability of our analytic method to another pathogen microarray platform, we used the e-predict training set <cit> . the dataset was comprised of <dig> virochip microarray hybridizations of viral samples previously characterized by direct immunofluorescence. the viruses represented were human papillomavirus <dig> , influenza a virus , hepatitis b , respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus . one clinical isolate of influenza a virus also contained a respiratory syncytial virus . the array was comprised of <dig> probes; the <dig> probes excluded from the e-predict analysis were also excluded from this study. statistical tests and implementation three well-known statistical tests were used to evaluate the presence or absence of viruses in our hybridization experiments . a set of negative control probes was used as a reference. probe pairs for both the plus and minus orientations were present on the array. we assessed the relative utility of probe pairings by performing statistical tests using the plus strand alone and the minus strand alone, and by pooling the pairs together. permutation tests were performed when needed to determine significance. programs for statistical computation were written either in perl or with modules from the r project for statistical computing http://www.r-project.org. mann-whitney u test t-tests and anova tests are the most common form of statistical tests in microarray analysis literature <cit> , and have been successfully applied to pathogen arrays <cit> . the mann-whitney u test is the nonparametric analogue of the student's t-test. by using ranked data, it assesses whether two groups of samples are drawn from the same distribution. in our experimental application, the signals of viral probes that targeted a single strain were compared to an equal number of negative control probes. if a virus was targeted by less than <dig> probes, negative control probes were supplemented to achieve an n of <dig> the null hypothesis was that virus specific probes and negative control probes had the same central tendency . in each instance, the significance of the u statistic was computed with the commonly-used normal approximation for large samples <cit> . spearman correlation correlation is the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. the most common method of assessing correlation between two continuous variables is pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. a normal data distribution is not a requirement of the test although equality of variance is assumed <cit> . the variance assumption has been shown to be a confounder in microarray analysis <cit> ; thus we decided to use a more conservative correlation measure that makes use of ranked data: namely, spearman's rank correlation coefficient. in this application, the change in the gibbs free energy values of the predicted probe-virus target hybrids was used as the independent variable, while the dependent variable was the observed probe signal . Δg was used to predict fluorescence and to model surface hybridization kinetics <cit> . an equal number of negative control probes were pooled with viral probes to ensure that a wide range of signals would be examined. this was necessary to ensure that a correlation could be computed, because a uniformly high signal would be regarded as uncorrelated to the Δg value. for negative control probes, the independent variable was the Δg of the predicted human ribosomal rna duplexes. the null hypothesis was that a fluorescent signal would not be predicted by Δg . one sided p-values for correlations were computed using a standard student's t-distribution approximation <cit> . binomial test the binomial test is a subset of the x <dig> method; it tests the probability of observing a series of events according to an expected probability rate. an example of this kind of test would be an assessment of the fairness of gaming dice <cit> . in this application, we \"binned\" the probe signals into percentiles and then categorized them as positive or negative based on whether their computed values were located above or below a certain threshold. probes for a single virus were tested against the x <dig> distribution in such a way that the expected probability was equal to the probability rate of the negative control probes. the null hypothesis was that above the threshold, there was no difference between the proportion of virus specific probes and negative control probes. the threshold choice for the binomial test clearly has a strong influence on the results; our own exploratory testing of various percentile thresholds showed that the 90th percentile generated the best performance for our needs. all binomial tests were conducted using the 90th percentile in categorizing probes as \"positive\" or \"negative.\" we concluded that the threshold value for the test, whatever it might be, should be considered a parameter for optimization. multiple test correction via the false discovery rate an issue that often arises in testing a series of null hypotheses is the increase in the probability of the occurrence of a type i error . conservative familywise correction methods such as bonferroni's have been applied to microarray data. an alternative method, first described by benjamini and hochberg <cit> and then revised by storey <cit> , involves correcting the proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses. here we used storey's method and defined its parameters, within our study, as the proportion of the viruses identified through array hybridization that prove to be false leads <cit> . in a multiple hypothesis test scenario, requiring a q value of ≤ 5% for there to be \"significance\" would indicate that up to 5% of the viruses identified as present in a sample may, in fact, have been truly absent. in contrast, requiring a p value of ≤ 5% for there to be \"significance\" indicates that up to 5% of all truly absent viruses may be identified as present. q-values were calculated from test p-values by using the q-value module from the r project contributed by storey. assessment of test performance a table of correct predictions for each hybridized virus was created by using the ncbi taxonomy database . a prediction was considered a \"true positive\" if either the specific virus introduced in the experiment or any other virus in the same genus was, thereby, predicted. q-values with a threshold of 10% were used; and the top <dig> predictions for each method were evaluated. species prediction could also have been assessed, but would have been less indicative of algorithm performance because the concept of what constitutes a viral species is not comparable between the various taxonomic families . what is more, highly similar strains may be impossible to distinguish by examining their microarray signature, yet still be defined as different species; in contrast, viruses from different genera are more easily distinguishable. false positive rate and positive predictive value were used to assess the performance of the various test models. ppv is a commonly used standard for diagnostic tests; it is the probability that a positive test result will reflect the presence of a virus in the sample. ppv is the ratio of the number of true positives to the sum of the number of true positives and false positives; false negatives are not used in the ppv method. in our particular application of the method, it was the ratio of the number of statistically significant and correct predictions to the sum of all the statistically significant predictions generated; predictions below the significance threshold were ignored. ppv is a useful measure of algorithm performance because it is not sensitive to heterogeneity or misclassification in viral taxonomy; it is not necessary to predict that all members of a genus are present in order to achieve a favorable score. RESULTS deviation from normality in fluorescence distribution to assess the effects of variability that derive from the concentration of viral nucleic acid and host nucleic acid in clinical samples, we characterized the effect of a varying input of human rna on the fluorescence distribution of the log-transformed probe signals. while an analysis by giles and kipling of affymetrix arrays based on <dig> nt probes indicated that the fluorescence distributions of their log-transformed probe signals were indeed close to normal <cit> , our experience with <dig> nt probe arrays showed strong deviations from a normal distribution. increases in rna input have complex effects on signal distribution: the degree of skew is increased and the upper tail is lengthened . we tested the normality of these distributions and found strong deviations for all three experiments . sample distributions of fluorescent signals deriving from virus-infected tissue-culture cell hybridizations are available in additional file <dig> figure s <dig> the observed signal distributions included gaussian, highly kurtotic and bimodal; host rna concentration can only partially explain these differences. other explanations include: a large proportion homologous probes on the array increasing the upper tail, differences in amplification or labeling efficiency from sample to sample, and differences in hybridization affinity due to guanine/cytosine proportion in viral transcripts. while more complex methods of transformation have been described elsewhere, these have focused on improving the sensitivity of transcript profiling measurements and, we surmised, were unlikely to improve sensitivities in our application. parametric analysis of microarray data is particularly sensitive to transformations; violations of normality will lead to a loss of power, and may result in invalid p values <cit> . reverse complement controls reduce noise replication of hybridization experiments can improve specificity <cit> ; however, the expense incurred by processing multiple arrays or low quantities of nucleic acid in one's clinical sample may preclude the use of this approach. alternative strategies that might be adopted include the application of either replicate probes and/or reverse complementary probes to the same array. a study using agilent <dig> nt in-situ synthesized arrays found that replicate probes were highly concordant <cit> , and useful both in improving normalization and in identifying outlier signals <cit> . reverse complements have been used on spotted oligonucleotide arrays for pathogens <cit> , although no quantitative assessments of their advantages have been reported up to this point. in such studies as are mentioned above, in situ synthesized oligonucleotides are immobilized at the 3' end. probe-target helix stability near the surface is likely to be reduced due to steric hindrance. thus, probes that are mismatched to their targets will be strongly affected by the specific mismatch position . to identify a printing strategy that would reduce false positive signals, we conducted pilot studies using infected cell extracts of wnv containing <dig> and <dig> copies of viral template rna as input for the reverse transcriptase reaction. amplification products were hybridized on an array containing both replicate and reverse complement probes, while human lung rna was used as a control. in all experiments, replicate probe pairs were better correlated than reverse complement pairs for both wnv cognate probes and non-flavivirus probes. when wnv was present, reverse complement probes had a higher correlation than when no wnv was present; this differential response was stronger in probes that had the highest degree of signal . tenth p < . <dig> for all except † correcting for sequence composition reduces the false positive rate † hybridization performed on different days even after gc correction, a strong prediction for a chicken endogenous retrovirus was identified from the influenza virus hybridization by all three methods. the virus was cultured in eggs that are likely to express the viral transcripts, indicating that a microarray can indeed identify co-infections. a binomial test correctly predicts the viral genus in a majority of cases statistical methods were compared for gc-corrected signals by using ppv , which is the probability that a diagnostic test will correctly report the causative agent of an illness. in clinical applications, the identification of a viral genus is sufficient to direct other molecular identification methods as well as to prescribe initial clinical measures. thus, we measured the success of each statistical method by whether it correctly predicted the presence of a hybridized viral isolate or any other virus within the same genus. the precise number of times that the most statistically significant prediction proved to be correct was also tabulated . statistical analysis was carried out with coding sense probes, antisense probes, or both probe types pooled together, as independent measures of the quantity of viral nucleic acid. a strategy of averaging probe values resulted in a performance similar to that of those instances when coding sense probes alone were used. top <dig> predictions; q value threshold = <dig> † lasv is targeted by four probes the binomial test obtained the highest ppv of 91% when both sense probes and antisense probes were taken into account, while the mann-whitney u test also performed favorably. in contrast, the spearman correlation coefficient test had a substantially lower ppv of 33%. a relaxation of the multiple-testing correction requirements resulted in an improvement in the spearman ppv for antisense probes to 76% but such a relaxation of correction requirements is undesirable due to the potential rise in false positives that might result . in two cases , the use of both sense and antisense probes reduced the overall ppv; however the input virus was nonetheless correctly predicted. in another case , the pooling of the two probe methods resulted in detection where the virus would otherwise have been missed. validation of binomial and mann-whitney u test performance on the virochip platform a publically available dataset from urisman et al. was downloaded and analyzed using the mann-whitney u and binomial tests. the virochip dataset was comprised of <dig> hybridizations of samples derived from tissue culture, nasal lavage or serum. the samples contained papillomavirus, influenza a virus, hepatitis b virus, respiratory syncytial virus or human rhinovirus. the virochip platform differs from ours in the following ways: oligonucleotide probe length , number of probes , fabrication method , incorporation of fluorescence and presence of gc-matched negative control probes. however, the virochip platform does include the use of reverse complement probes and employs a random-pcr based nucleic acid amplification strategy that is similar to ours. two other methods reported a high degree of predictive accuracy when they were used to examine the same dataset. similarly, we report having achieved a high degree of accuracy when using two nonparametric testing methods together with the same parameters that were used for our in-situ synthesized probe platform. we report on our performance in this instance by relying on a simple metric: the rank of the first correct prediction . the first prediction of the mann-whitney u test was correct in 47% of the cases; a correct prediction was present among the first ten predictions in 91% of the cases. the average correct prediction rank for the mann-whitney u test was <dig> . the largest number of incorrect predictions were for human herpesvirus <dig> , human herpesvirus <dig> and human herpesvirus <dig> , regardless of the sample source. the first prediction of the binomial test was correct in 75% of the cases; a correct prediction was present among the first ten predictions in 98% of the cases. the average correct prediction rank for the binomial test was <dig> . as in the mann-whitney u results, the majority of incorrect predictions were for hhv <dig> watson et al. reported a similar false-positive result using a t-test method <cit> . hhv <dig> has a seroprevelance of 85% in humans and can be readily detected in blood, saliva and cervical tissue <cit> . the degree of prevalence suggests that the predictions represent a true co-infection; however, validation of this would require further molecular tests. both the binomial and mann-whitney u methods generated statistically significant predictions for an influenza virus and rsv co-infected sample. the binominal test outperformed the mann-whitney test on the virochip data, largely because mann-whitney's ranking on hhv <dig> was lower. the binomial test's performance without optimization was comparable to that of e-predict and to that of detectiv , however, a binomial test does not require probe-level weighting or assumption of normality. discussion although expression profiling and viral microarrays may employ similar methods for printing probes and for preparing and hybridizing nucleic acids, they differ markedly in their analytical strategy. a fundamental assumption in expression profiling is that the majority of the various gene transcript mrnas are present in the sample . differential expression is identified by computing the ratio of probe signal for a gene in two conditions . in a viral microarray experiment, absence of signal from all probes is a plausible result. this may reflect any of the following: that no agent is present; that an agent is present but there are no probes for it because it is either truly new or sufficiently different to confound hybridization; that a known agent is present and that probes are appropriate but that levels are insufficient to enable detection. the results presented here indicate that the quantity of host nucleic acid used in hybridization has substantive effects on a probe's fluorescent signal distribution that manifest as deviations from normality. we speculate that these deviations represent mass effects when concentrations are high enough to drive up the proportion of partially hybridized strands. probe sequence composition was identified as a major confounder that resulted in high fpr. probe signal correction by gc content improved predictions. we tested the effect of various probe control strategies on the fpr. a hybridization requirement for both sense and antisense probes was more helpful in reducing the fpr than the use of hybridization to replicate probes. an additional important negative control was the inclusion of shuffled viral probes that enabled examination of the effects of array-wide gc content. a key strength of this study was its effective control of the familywise error rate, achieved via its use of storey's fdr technique <cit> . while this method successfully lowered the fpr, there was a mild violation in the independence assumption as some probes target multiple viruses. q values remain useful when p values are correlated within blocks <cit> , a condition we expect to be true within our probe-sets. methods that explicitly address dependence have recently been under investigation <cit> and should be incorporated in any future versions of our method. nonparametric statistical methods are more conservative than equivalent parametric ones; consequently, they are less likely to require that one reject the null hypothesis when it is false . the variability of microarray signal distributions in our study suggested that parametric predictions may be inaccurate; for this reason, we tested a number of nonparametric approaches. of the three methods that we assessed, the binomial test was the most successful, achieving a 91% ppv. a further development of our study might include empirically determining a more optimal threshold by using spike-in controls or by adding more categories to reflect different levels of confidence . the mann-whitney u test was also successful in that it predicted the presence of nearly all agents. this result conforms with a similar study using t-tests <cit> . yet the mann-whitney u assessment was sensitive to sequence composition; its ppv on uncorrected signal data was only 48%. the spearman correlation performed poorly, correctly predicting only three disease agents. a pearson correlation method has been successfully applied to pathogen arrays, according to urisman et al. <cit> . the e-predict method performs an in silico hybridization between fully sequenced viral genomes and a viral array. after a clinical sample is hybridized, the predicted fluorescence for each virus is compared to the observed signal. the strength of correlation is used to identify which virus, if any, is responsible for the signal pattern. in our study and in urisman's, the spearman correlation performed poorly. we re-explored this result by relaxing the requirement for a multiple testing correction and found that it improved the degree of predictive accuracy, but the spearman assessment still did not perform as well as the other tests . accordingly, we concluded that the spearman correlation as implemented was not as discriminative as other nonparametric tests. CONCLUSIONS we report the successful application of two nonparametric tests that require few assumptions that have a high degree of predictive accuracy and have extremely low false positive rates. in a direct assessment of the binomial and mann-whitney u tests on a related pathogen microarray platform, the binomial test performed comparably to other reported methods . in contrast to these methods, the binomial test achieved a high degree of predictive accuracy on ranked data without probe-specific weighting parameters, iterative analysis or assumptions of normality. authors' contributions pq and jh carried out the virus culture, quantitation and microarray hybridization experiments. gp and tb helped to design microarrays and devise experiments. mh provided statistical advice. oj and sc programmed the analytic technique and wrote the manuscript. wil and oj designed and analyzed the various experiments. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. supplementary material additional file 1 hybridization summary. summary of viral and control hybridizations, corresponding geo accession numbers and location of data presented in manuscript. click here for file additional file 2 fluorescent signal data used in table <dig> compressed file in csv format containing a table of signal values where probe reverse complements and replicates are in rows. click here for file additional file 3 figure s <dig> graphical description of non-parametric tests evaluated in study click here for file additional file 4 viral genus classification table. file contains a table of viral accession numbers in rows, and a list of viruses in columns. values are a boolean for whether the viral sequence in the row is considered to be in the genus of the virus listed at the top of the column . this table was used to calculate positive predictive value. click here for file additional file 5 figure s <dig> histograms of fluorescent signal for hybridizations to a pan-viral microarray. click here for file additional file 6 figure s <dig> comparison of probe printing strategies for pathogen arrays. click here for file additional file 7 figure s <dig> relationship between fluorescence and probe sequence composition. click here for file additional file 8 fluorescent signal data used in table <dig> compressed file in csv format containing a table of signal values where probe reverse complements and replicates are in rows. data is not corrected for probe sequence composition. click here for file additional file 9 fluorescent signal data used in table <dig> compressed file in csv format containing a table of signal values where probe reverse complements and replicates are in rows. data is corrected for probe sequence composition using a lowess fit. click here for file additional file 10 table s <dig> positive predictive value for methods of pathogen identification with no multiple testing correction. click here for file acknowledgements we thank saul silverstein, christos kyratsous, vincent racaniello, angela rasmussen, adolfo garcia-sastre and stuart nichol for providing the virus samples used in the experiments reported on here. we also thank alla tashmukhamedova for providing excellent technical assistance on the microarray experiments. funding this work was supported by awards from the national institutes of health and google.org.",

. the gene-for-gene defense response is a strong form of plant resistance against pathogens. this type of resistance is turned on when the plants have a specific resistance gene that recognizes the product of a corresponding pathogen gene known as the avirulence gene. this interaction between an r-gene and an avr-gene triggers the hypersensitive response and rapid expression of defense responses that result in programmed cell death within <dig> h of infection <cit> . another type of defense response occurs after attack by virulent pathogens that do not have an avr-gene recognized by the plant. in this case, the plant responds more slowly than in gene-for-gene resistance, allowing the pathogen to multiply. resistance to virulent pathogens can occur through a phenomenon called systemic acquired resistance <cit> , which occurs after the hypersensitive response. sar reduces symptoms produced by a variety of pathogens, but not by all pathogens <cit> . salicylic acid plays a central signaling role in both gene-for-gene resistance and sar. this role for sa was proven by construction of transgenic plants expressing a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase gene that converts sa to catechol <cit> . during gene-for-gene resistance or infection with virulence pathogens, the nahg plants failed to express pathogenesis related genes, and their susceptibility to both virulent and avirulent pathogens was greatly enhanced <cit> . mutants of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana have been used for studying sa-dependent regulation of plant defense responses. production of certain defense signals is controlled by the arabidopsis pad <dig> gene. plants carrying pad <dig> mutations displayed reduced levels of sa, decreased expression of the defense gene pr <dig> and reduced synthesis of the indole derivative, camalexin, after infection with a virulent strain of pseudomonas syringae <cit> . in contrast, the role of pad <dig> in defense against the green peach aphid myzus persicae sulzer is independent of sa and camalexin <cit> . reported that pad <dig> encodes a nucleo-cytoplasmic protein which has similarity to triacyl glycerol lipases and other esterases. in defense signaling, pad <dig> acts in conjunction with the eds <dig> gene , which encodes a structurally related protein also found in the nucleus and cytoplasm <cit> . eds <dig> is required for accumulation of pad <dig> protein <cit> . eds <dig> also interacts with another lipase-like protein, sag <dig> , which accumulates in the nucleus <cit> . the occurrence of eds1-pad <dig> and eds1-sag <dig> complexes inside plant cells suggests that eds <dig> works as an adaptor for both pad <dig> and sag <dig> in defense signaling <cit> . although pad <dig> has been extensively studied in arabidopsis, less is known about its role in conferring resistance to nematodes, and it is not known if atpad <dig> can function in economically important crops, such as soybean, to provide resistance to nematodes. the soybean cyst nematode and the root-knot nematode are obligatory plant parasites that are responsible for more than <dig> billion u. s. dollars in yield losses annually of economic crops worldwide <cit> . both nematode species establish complex feeding sites within their host plants. at infection, the pre-parasitic second stage juveniles penetrate the roots and migrate towards the vascular cylinder where they induce the growth of a multinuclear feeding site, termed a ‘syncytium’ produced by scn and a ‘giant cell’ produced by rkn <cit> . the scn life cycle, which can be completed in about <dig> days under optimum conditions, includes six stages: the egg, four juvenile stages, and the adult <cit> . the only stage to infect plant roots is the j <dig> which is motile and typically penetrates the host root and migrates to the vascular cylinder while secreting cell-wall degrading enzymes <cit> . once there, the nematode injects proteins into a host cell through its stylet, inducing formation of the syncytium <cit> . many physiological and morphological changes occur during formation of the syncytium: surrounding cell walls partially dissolve, nuclei enlarge, the density of organelles in the cytoplasm increases, and there is an accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum <cit> . initiation and formation of the syncytium is a complicated process requiring an unknown host signal transduction pathway triggered by secretions from the nematode esophageal glands <cit> . after the feeding site is initiated, the j <dig> molts to the j <dig> and j <dig> stages before finally developing into a female or male adult. the female remains sedentary at the feeding site while the mature male becomes mobile in the root to fertilize the female. the female extracts nourishment from the syncytium to support the production of several hundred eggs, most of which stay inside the female’s body, while others are excreted as a gelatinous mass into the soil. after the female dies, the body remains intact and hardens into a tough leathery sac known as a cyst. eggs and larvae can survive in the cyst body for several years until they are stimulated to hatch in the soil under favorable conditions <cit> . the life cycle of rkn varies from three weeks to several months depending on environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, and availability of a suitable host <cit> . the infective second stage juveniles penetrate the roots of the host plant using the piercing action of their stylets. once inside, the nematode releases esophageal secretions which induce the formation of a multinucleate feeding cell. the j <dig> becomes sedentary, feeds, and undergoes three molts . occasionally vermiform males develop and migrate out of the roots, while females remain sedentary, feeding and producing eggs in a gelatinous matrix. embryogenesis begins inside the egg, and j <dig> individuals hatch after the first molt <cit> . in this work, we demonstrate that overexpression of the arabidopsis gene atpad <dig> in transgenic soybean roots of composite plants can confer resistance to both scn and rkn. RESULTS agrobacterium transformation of soybean roots with red fluorescent protein the rfp gene was cloned into the prap <dig> vector and expressed in soybean roots to confirm the overexpression functionality of the prap <dig> vector . transformed roots were identified by the presence of green fluorescent protein throughout the root . strong red fluorescence demonstrated that the figwort mosaic virus subgenomic transcript promoter was successful in expressing the rfp gene in the transformed soybean roots. strong green fluorescence throughout the root demonstrated that the rold promoter was successful for driving the egfp gene . when the images were overlapped, the red and green fluorescence were co-localized . the magnification was 25x. agrobacterium transformation of soybean roots with atpad4 we cloned the arabidopsis pad <dig> gene into prap <dig> for overexpression in transgenic soybean roots of composite plants. the amino acid sequence of atpad <dig> is moderately conserved with the closest soybean homolog glyma08g <dig> . atpad <dig> shares <dig> % amino acids identity with gmpad <dig> . both proteins possess a lipase <dig> motif conserved throughout numerous proteins. of <dig> soybean plants subjected to root transformation with the atpad <dig> gene, 55% showed evidence of transformation <dig> days after planting as shown by egfp fluorescence. the transformation efficiency for the empty prap <dig> control plants was 74%. after partial trimming of the untransformed roots and an additional <dig> days of growth, all untransformed roots were removed and the remaining roots displaying strong egfp fluorescence were inoculated with rkn or scn for assay. molecular analysis of putative transgenic plants the insertion of the atpad <dig> gene fragments in transgenic soybean plants was detected by pcr using gene specific primers . the <dig> bp fragment was amplified with the gene specific primers. four plants were tested and all were shown to contain transgenic dnas. no amplification was detected in untransformed control roots and control roots transformed with empty prap <dig> qrt-pcr to determine the expression of atpad <dig> gene in soybean roots roots expressing egfp were further analyzed to determine the abundance of atpad <dig> gene transcripts by qrt-pcr using gene specific primers . the absolute quantification of the transcripts was calculated using the sigmoidal method described by <cit> . atpad <dig> transcripts in the overexpressing roots were abundant, while the control roots displayed no detectable to the atpad <dig> . the number of transcripts of atpad <dig> in the roots transformed with the atpad <dig> construct was calculated to be <dig> molecules. although transcripts of atpad <dig> were not detectable in the control roots containing empty vector , transcripts of the housekeeping gene encoding ubiquitin- <dig> were similar in all samples . in addition to measuring transcript levels of atpad <dig> we also used qrt-pcr to determine the number of transcripts of three defense-related genes, gmpad4; gmeds <dig> and gmpr <dig> . the number of transcripts of gmpad <dig> in roots overexpressing atpad <dig> were almost double the number found in control roots. in the same roots, the number of transcripts of gmeds <dig> did not change significantly between atpad4-overexpressing roots and control roots. however, the number of transcripts of gmpr <dig> in atpad4-overexpressing roots was almost double that found in control roots containing empty vector. effect of atpad <dig> overexpression in soybean roots resistance resistance to soybean cyst nematode the effect of overexpression of atpad <dig> in roots of the susceptible soybean cultivar ‘williams82’ on the development of scn females was examined by counting the number of mature scn females on atpad4-overexpressing and control roots <dig> days after inoculation . there was a 68% reduction in the mean number of scn females per plant on atpad4-overexpressing roots as compared to the prap <dig> control . when expressed as number of scn females per gram of root wet weight, the reduction was 76% in the atpad4-overexpressing plants. these differences are considered to be statistically significant , indicating that the expression of atpad <dig> in soybean roots interrupted the development of scn females . mean ± standard deviation . nc = nontransformed control; prap <dig> = empty prap <dig> control. resistance to root knot nematode the effect of overexpression of atpad <dig> in roots of the susceptible soybean cultivar ‘williams82’ on the development of rkn galls was examined by counting the number of galls on atpad4-overexpressing and control roots <dig> dai . under blue light, galls were easily identified as solid, thick green regions on the transformed roots. the mean number of rkn galls per plant was 77% lower on atpad4-overexpressing plants, compared to the prap <dig> control . when expressed as number of rkn galls per gram of root wet weight, the reduction was 72% in the atpad4-overexpressing plants. these differences are considered extremely statistically significant and indicate that the atpad <dig> gene interrupted rkn development . mean ± standard deviation . nc = nontransformed control; prap <dig> = empty prap <dig> control. the size of rkn galls and of rkn nematodes within roots was determined <dig> dai by measuring the area of their profiles using the leica microsystem software version <dig> for the laser capture microscope. the profile area of rkn galls in roots transformed with atpad <dig> was 86% smaller than that of rkn galls on control roots . similarly, the profile area of rkn nematodes was 66% smaller in atpad <dig> roots. thus there were many more immature nematodes in atpad <dig> roots than in control roots. we also observed fewer egg masses on the atpad <dig> roots. mean ± standard deviation . prap <dig> = empty prap <dig> control. discussion plant pathogen interaction sedentary endoparasitic nematodes comprise a large group of plant pathogens that infect and parasitize the roots of their hosts. the interaction between these nematodes and their hosts is highly complex, and their obligate root-parasitic nature has proven to be a hindrance to the molecular characterization of these pathosystems, including the targeted exploration of plant defense responses during nematode parasitism. as a consequence, compared with foliar bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens, there is a considerable lack of knowledge regarding which defense signaling genes or pathways are effective against plant-parasitic nematodes during a compatible interaction. effective plant defense against pests and pathogens involves recognition and activation of appropriate defenses. similar underlying mechanisms are likely to control this fundamental process in all flowering plants <cit> . therefore, structural and functional analysis of genes involved in plant defense in a model species such as arabidopsis thaliana heynh, can facilitate the identification of structural and functional orthologs and their role in disease resistance pathways in other plant species <cit> . natural plant populations and breeding populations of crop plants show qualitative and quantitative phenotypic variation for resistance to pests and pathogens. qualitative resistance is characterized by two distinct phenotype classes, resistant and susceptible, and follows mendelian inheritance. it is this type of single gene- or resistance gene-mediated resistance that has been most thoroughly studied in the context of plant-pathogen recognition and defense signaling <cit> . in contrast, quantitative resistance is characterized by continuous phenotypic variation ranging from high susceptibility to high resistance among the recombinant individuals within a progeny. such resistance is controlled by more than one gene and can be strongly influenced by environmental factors. resistance to scn is controlled by several resistance genes <cit> , and soybean cultivars can display a range of reactions to scn encompassing highly susceptible to resistant depending upon the scn population used for testing and the complement of rhg genes within the genome of the cultivar. the resistance genes appear to work in a scn population-specific or race-specific manner and most contribute only a small, additive amount to resistance <cit> . arabidopsis-pathogen interactions the genetic dissection of arabidopsis-pathogen interactions revealed great insights into plant defense and various defense signaling pathways. our knowledge of r gene-activated defenses, as well as regulators of salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , and ethylene dependent response pathways has expanded greatly in the last two decades <cit> . analyses of a. thaliana mutants that perturb various aspects of sa-mediated signal transduction has revealed that sa is an inhibitor of cyst nematode parasitism during a compatible interaction <cit> . mutants unable to synthesize or accumulate sa showed a consistently increased susceptibility phenotype to h. schachtii. the pretreatment of wild-type plants with sa significantly decreased their susceptibility to the nematode while simultaneously inducing pr- <dig> gene expression in both roots and shoots. taken together, these data strongly suggest that sa mediated signaling plays a significant role in limiting nematode parasitism during a compatible interaction. <cit> showed that application of sa to tomato plants prior to inoculation with root-knot nematode alleviated root galling; however, this effect of sa was believed to be nematicidal in nature due to the high concentrations of sa that were used in the experiment. <cit> showed that pad <dig> modulates camalexin synthesis and sa synthesis and signaling in arabidopsis defense against pathogens. although, there have been extensive studies on the defense response of arabidopsis to fungal and bacterial pathogens , little of this work in arabidopsis has been directly translated to economically important food crops, such as soybean, and particularly in respect to plant parasitic nematodes. the arabidopsis lipase-like protein phytoalexin deficient <dig> was identified by several genetic studies as essential component for plant immunity against virulent pathogens for promoting the defense signaling hormone salicylic acid and the phytoalexin camalexin <cit> . our experiments show that atpad4can be used in an economically important crop, soybean, to provide a measure of resistance to two different genera of nematodes. in arabidopsis, the pad <dig> gene functions upstream of the defense responses triggered by sa <cit> . pad <dig> can work in combination with eds <dig> to trigger aspects of the defense response, but eds <dig> can also interact with sag <dig> independent of pad <dig> <cit> . in our experiments, overexpression of atpad <dig> in soybean roots did not greatly influence levels of transcripts of gmeds <dig> but there was an increase in gm pr <dig> transcripts. pr <dig> transcription is responsive to increased sa levels and is downstream of sa <cit> . overexpression expression of atpad <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis conferred resistance to green peach aphid <cit> . this resistance did not require eds <dig> our data, extend understanding of atpad <dig> by showing that this arabidopsis gene can be overexpressed in an economically important crop to confer resistance to two distinct genera of nematodes. CONCLUSIONS here, we demonstrated that the overexpression of atpad <dig> in roots of g. max confers resistance to two different genera of nematodes. it decreases the number of mature female scn cysts and decreased the number of galls formed by rkn in the susceptible soybean cultivar ‘williams82’. moreover, the size of rkn galls and nematodes in atpad4-expressing roots was significantly reduced and fewer egg masses were present, confirming that the ectopic overexpression atpad <dig> in soybean roots disrupted the rkn life cycle. this work provides a basis for unraveling the potential role of defense signaling genes in quantitative disease resistance in this major crop species, and it demonstrates that an arabidopsis gene can confer resistance in an important field crop to two genera of nematodes having worldwide importance.",

RESULTS sah model sah was induced by injecting <dig> μl blood into the prechiasmatic cistern in the rat. the raf inhibitor sb-386023-b was injected intracisternally in our rat model at <dig> <dig> or <dig> hours after the sah. the total number of rats used in the study was 71; <dig> in the sham group, <dig> in the sah + vehicle group, <dig> in the sah group and <dig> was used in the sah + treatment with sb386023-b groups. the mortality rate was 8% and the animals died during the follow up, there was no difference in the mortality rate between the groups. the rats did not show any distressed behaviour. they were moving around normally, eating and drinking. all surviving animals were neurologically examined using an established scoring system <cit> . all sah + vehicle animals and sah animals treated with sb386023-b after <dig> h received a score of <dig> and the sham animals and sah animals treated with sb386023-b after <dig> and <dig> h got a score of <dig> in all operated rats, mean arterial blood pressure , partial pco <dig> , partial po <dig> , hematocrit values and temperature were within acceptable limits during the operation. no statistical difference was seen in physiological parameters between the groups; sham, sah + vehicle and sah treated with sb386023-b at the different time points. as a result of injecting the blood the cortical blood flow dropped over both hemispheres to <dig> ± 5% of resting flow and the intracranial pressure increased from <dig> ± <dig> to <dig> ± <dig> mmhg. the laser doppler blood flow and the elevated icp returned to the basal values within one hour of postoperative monitoring. there was no difference between the sah groups. acute effects of the raf inhibitor sb386023-b on cbf, icp and functional responses the acute effects of the raf inhibitor sb386023-b on cbf, icp and functional responses was investigated. there were no immediate changes in the cortical cbf or the icp when sb386023-b was administrated at <dig> h or <dig> h after the sah . in addition, there were no difference in the local cortical blood flow response and icp during the acute phase between the groups sah and sah treated with sb386023-b. this shows that the raf inhibitor sb386023-b has no acute effect on the cortical cbf and icp. to study if the raf inhibitor has a direct vasomotor effect on cerebral blood vessels, isolated ring segments of the mca were studied in a myograph. the functional data shows that sb386023-b had no effect on the contractility when it was applied in increasing concentrations directly on the isolated mca . in artery segments precontracted with 5-ht, sb386023-b tended to relax the mca slightly but the effect was not significant at any concentration . regional cerebral blood flow to evaluate the overall consequences of sah the regional and global cbf was investigated by an autoradiographic method in the various groups; sham, sah and sah treated with sb386023-b. there was a significant global decrease in cerebral blood flow measured at <dig> h in the sah group as compared to the control sham group from <dig> ± <dig> to <dig> ± <dig> ml/ <dig> g/min. treatment with sb386023-b, starting at <dig> h and <dig> h after the sah, prevented the reduction in cbf seen after sah but not at <dig> h . the sah animals showed a reduction in the regional cbf in <dig> of the <dig> brain regions examined compared to the control operated rats . treatment with sb386023-b in conjunction with the sah at <dig> and after <dig> h of sah prevented this reduction in rcbf and there was no difference as compared to the control group for any of the regions studied. treatment with sb386023-b administered at <dig> h after induction of sah did not prevent this reduction in rcbf . values are expressed in ml/min/ <dig> g and given as mean ± s.e.m. a = significant difference between sah and control groups, b = significant difference between sah and sah treated with sb386023-b <dig> hr and <dig> hr post sah. functional in vitro pharmacology k+ -induced contractions did not differ significantly between the cerebral arteries from the different groups . the emax and pec <dig> values for respective groups are presented in table <dig> and <dig> responses were characterized by emax values, expressed as percent of <dig> mm k+ -induced contraction, and pec <dig> values . values are represented as mean ± s.e.m and n represents number of animal. a = significant difference between sah and control groups, b = significant difference between sah and sah treated with sb386023-b sah + sb386023-b at <dig> h responses were characterized by emax values, expressed as percent of <dig> mm k+ -induced contraction, and pec <dig> values . values are represented as mean ± s.e.m and n represents number of animal. a = significant difference between sah and control groups, b = significant difference between sah and sah treated with sb386023-b contractile response to et-1 in the middle cerebral artery and basilar artery from sah rats et- <dig> showed a leftward shift of the concentration-response curve which indicates an enhanced contractile response to et- <dig> as compared to the sham-operated rats where a sigmoid curve was obtained . treatment with sb386023-b starting at <dig> and <dig> h after sah produced a significantly attenuated et- <dig> induced response, compared to the rats with induced sah. interestingly there was no significant difference in the contractile response between sham and sb386023-b given at <dig> and <dig> h after sah . when the sb386023-b treatment was begun at <dig> h after the induced sah the responses did not differ from that seen in animals receiving only sah . contractile response to 5-ct 5-ct gave rise to a biphasic concentration-dependent contraction, indicating the presence of the two 5-ht receptor subtypes 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a as verified by previous detailed antagonist studies <cit> . this has been confirmed using gr <dig> a selective 5-ht1b receptor antagonist, shifting the high-affinity phase to the right and removing the 5-ht1b component of the low-affinity phase <cit> . in both mca and ba from rats with induced sah 5-ct gave rise to an elevated emax, emax and pec <dig> as compared to the sham-operated rats . in ba treatment in vivo with sb386023-b starting at <dig> h and <dig> h after sah showed down regulated responses, both the first 5-ht1b and the second 5-ht2a phases were lower as compared to rats with induced sah . in the mca treatment with sb386023-b at <dig> h and <dig> h after the sah showed significantly reduced emax and tended to a decrease in the emax, pec <dig> and pec <dig> as compared to sah . sb386023-b treatment given <dig> h after the induced sah did not show attenuated contractile response as compared to sah . contractile response to ang ii in mca from rats with induced sah ang ii induced a concentration-dependent contraction . treatment with sb386023-b given at <dig> and <dig> h after the sah produced a significantly attenuated ang ii induced response, compared to the rats with induced sah. interestingly there was no significant difference in the contractile response between sham and sb386023-b given at <dig> and <dig> h after the sah . however, sb386023-b treatment given <dig> h after the induced sah did not show attenuated contractile response as compared to sah. ang ii did not induce increased contractility in the ba after sah. in the absence of the at <dig> receptor antagonist pd <dig> there was no increased contractile response to ang ii after sah as compared to sham . quantitative mrna expression to quantify mrna for the eta, etb, at <dig> at <dig> and 5-ht1b receptors, rt-pcr and real-time detection monitoring the pcr products was employed. the standard curves for each primer pair had almost similar slopes, demonstrating that ef- <dig> eta, etb, 5-ht1b, at <dig> and at <dig> cdna were amplified with the same efficiency . in each pcr experiment, a no template control was included, and there were no signs of contaminating nucleic acids in the samples. since the results from the different brain arteries examined mca, ba and circle of willis were identical, they were grouped together in the statistical analysis. the results showed that treatment with sb386023-b inhibited the enhanced expression of etb, 5-ht1b and at <dig> receptor mrna levels significantly as compared to control . there was no difference in the expression of eta and at <dig> receptor mrna levels between the three groups sham, sah and sah treated with sb386023-b . perk1/ <dig> expression examined by western blot the phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> protein levels was investigated by western blot. the perk1/ <dig> protein levels were activated after sah as compared to sham the treatment with the raf inhibitor sb386023-b at <dig> h after sah prevented the perk1/ <dig> protein level activation . however, sb386023-b given <dig> h after sah did not attenuate the perk1/ <dig> protein levels . protein expression examined with immunohistochemistry the localization and activation of the protein levels was examined by confocal microscopy and immunocytochemistry using selective antibodies towards the phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> etb, 5-ht1b and at <dig> receptors. the results demonstrated that the perk1/ <dig> etb, 5-ht1b and at <dig> receptors were all present in the cytoplasm of the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. double immunohistochemistry staining versus smooth muscle actin, revealed their co-expression in the smooth muscle cells were performed to verify the localization and in the circle of willis arteries, the mca and the ba, the microvessels in the brain . the etb receptor protein was expressed in the smooth muscle cells and this signal was increased in sah as compared to sham . similarly the 5-ht1b and at <dig> receptor proteins were expressed more in sah as compared to sham and ; respectively . treatment with the raf inhibitor sb386023-b, starting with administration at <dig> h or <dig> h after sah blunted the sah induced upregulation of etb , 5-ht1b and at <dig> receptor protein levels in the smooth muscle cells . however, when the sb386023-b treatment was started <dig> h after the induced sah it did not attenuate the upregulated 5-ht1b and at <dig> receptor protein levels in the smooth muscle cell layer as compared to the sah . after sah the perk1/ <dig> level was increased in the smooth muscle cells as compared to sham . treatment with the erk1/ <dig> inhibitor at <dig> h and <dig> h after starting the sah prevented the perk1/ <dig> activation . sb386023-b given <dig> h after sah did not attenuate the perk1/ <dig> . etb 5-ht1b at1 perk1/2 values are expressed as percentage of control and given as mean ± s.e.m. in addition, as can be seen in figure <dig> and <dig> the upregulation was not confined only to the large cerebral arteries but notable also in the brain parenchyma micro vessels but not in the brain tissue proper, in neurons or glial cells. treatment with sb386023-b reduced also the microvessels receptor expression and the perk1/ <dig> in the smooth muscle cells. discussion this study demonstrates that there is a clear association between cerebrovascular receptor upregulation via transcription involving activation of erk1/ <dig> and the subsequent reduction in cbf after sah. specific blockade of the mapk erk1/ <dig> activity with a raf inhibitor abolished the vascular smooth muscle cell perk1/ <dig> the receptor upregulation and normalised cbf and the neurology score despite administration of the inhibitor as late as at <dig> h after the start of the sah. if the raf inhibitor was given <dig> h after initiating the sah there were no significant changes in cbf, neurology score, contractile receptor upregulation and protein levels. there was, however one exception, the protein level for etb and the mrna levels were depressed also when the drug was given <dig> h after the sah. a number of mechanisms and receptors have been proposed to account for the late cerebral ischemia that occurs after sah with subsequent high morbidity. here we show that by intracisternal administration of a specific raf inhibitor this response can be modified which implicates that cerebrovascular smooth muscle receptor upregulation is an important part in the response to sah. the immunohistochemistry revealed that sah results in enhanced phosphorylation of perk1/ <dig> in the smooth muscle cells and that this expression is normalized by sb386023-b treatment. this confirms that specific inhibition of the ras/raf/mek/erk1/ <dig> signaling pathway in the cerebrovascular system is associated with the receptor protein expression. considerable efforts have been spent at the development and testing of drugs that may antagonize putative spasmogens, but to this date no effective drug exists <cit> . the latest in this line is the et receptor antagonist clazosentan <cit> ; the first preliminary study revealed an effect on large artery vasospasm but had no effect on the neurology deficit. the clinical trials with the selective eta antagonist clazosentan demonstrated that clazosentan reduces the severity of vasospasm following aneurysmal sah; however, there was no positive effect in the outcome of the patients. this supports our view that the inhibition of only one receptor system will not remedy other receptor systems involved. instead, the mechanism responsible for the receptor upregulation might be a more promising target. since the etiology of cerebral vasospasm is multifactorial, we hypothesize that several receptors are involved in the development and maintenance of this prolonged pathological contraction <cit> . our studies have demonstrated involvement of at least three groups of contractile cerebrovascular receptors in experimental sah <cit> and in human stroke <cit> ; this alludes to the possibility of the involvement of several receptor systems in late cerebral ischemia and makes it attractive to search for a key signal-transduction mechanism involved in the upregulation process. we observed that sah results in receptor upregulation not only of the large cerebral arteries but as shown in figure <dig> also of vascular smooth muscle cell receptors in brain microvessels. this latter observation might be of clinical relevance since the clazosentan study and the early nimodipine study <cit> revealed partial reversal of angiographic vasospasm but no or minor effect on clinical outcome. targeting only one of several important subtypes of receptors such as those of endothelin- <dig> serotonin or angiotensin ii separately in clinical or experimental trials might prevent cerebral ischemia to a certain degree as seen in the literature, but treatments aimed at a common signaling pathway would be more beneficial since further possible receptors and inflammatory mechanisms might be involved. in addition, the different receptor antagonists have profound systemic vascular effects which make their specific effects on the cerebral circulation difficult to obtain. we have demonstrated that upregulation of several of the contractile receptors in the cerebral vasculature are interconnected by their signal transduction pathways <cit> . hence, blocking common signal transduction pathways can simultaneously affect the signaling for production of these receptor subtypes <cit> . cerebral ischemia elicits a wide range of responses resulting in activation of a number of intracellular pathways. in particular there is an involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinases signalling pathway in cerebral vasospasm <cit> . the mapk is a family of serine/threonine protein kinases involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation and survival <cit> . interestingly it is only the erk1/ <dig> pathway and not those of p <dig> or jnk that is active during the first <dig> h after experimental sah <cit> . jnk and p <dig> are only activated at <dig> h and this may relate to inflammation and apoptosis which occur later in the process. in addition, sb386023-b is selective for the erk1/ <dig> pathway since it did not inhibit the jnk and p- <dig> mapk pathways <cit> . several other studies have evaluated the effect of available raf inhibitors on cerebrovascular g-protein coupled receptors <cit> . in additional the jnk, p <dig> and pkc inhibitors have been tested. however the erk1/ <dig> seems to be more important for the receptor upregulation <cit> . the raf inhibitor sb386023-b was the one showing the best inhibiting effect on the cerebrovascular receptors and the most specific for the mapk pathway, which is the reason why this inhibitor was chosen. in the present study we have performed a study closely related to the clinical reality. thus, sb386023-b was found to have no acute effect on the cbf, icp or on the tone of the mca or on its contractility. it is notable that the effect of the raf inhibitor was equally strong when administration was started <dig> h after the sah as when given at the time of the sah , but had no significant effect when it was given <dig> h after the sah. the present study was designed to examine the possibility of a therapeutic window of relevance to the clinic. interestingly, we observed that the upregulation of receptors are located to the cerebral blood vessels smc , with no signs of upregulation of either receptors or activation of perk1/ <dig> in the adjacent brain tissue. this is important since only a fraction of the sah patients have angiographic vasospasm <cit> . in addition, we observed that both the large cerebral arteries belonging to the circle of willis and the cerebral micro vessels in the brain parenchyma are involved to the same extent in cerebral ischemia after sah. the raf inhibitor sb386023-b affects all vessel types. one possibility may be that the micro vessels are involved in the ischemia that occurs without angiographic vasospasm and the larger arteries might be involved in ischemia where vasospasm takes place or can be visualized angiographically. CONCLUSIONS in conclusion, we have provided two important observations: first blockade of perk1/ <dig> with a raf inhibitor in the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells prevents the upregulation of contractile receptors and the associated reduction in the regional cbf and neurology score after sah. second the two phenomena are associated and putatively treatable also in the clinical setting since administration of the raf inhibitor first applied <dig> h after the induction of the sah showed to have effect. therefore, we suggest that this is a novel target for treatment of cerebrovascular disorders such as cerebral ischemia after sah.",

    "prompt": "Write a summary of the research hypothesis and results. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND as ubiquitous elements in nature, many heavy metals not only inhibit crop growth and reduce yields and quality but also pose a great threat to human health via food chain <cit> . cadmium is non-essential for all living organisms and extremely toxic to humans in micro molar concentrations. therefore, even healthy crops with very low level of cd could be toxic to humans <cit> . many studies have been conducted to elucidate the underlying responses of plants to cd stress and mechanisms conferring cd tolerance <cit> . plants have developed two major strategies to resist cd stress: “excluder” and “includer and tolerance” <cit> . under the “excluder” strategy, plants reduce the amount of cd entering their roots and shoots. for instance, these plants can restrict cd bioavailability from the soil, reduce the expression of transport proteins involve in cd uptake, and increase the expression of membrane transporters that extrude cd <cit> . the second strategy is “includer and tolerance” strategy, which relies on compartmentation and detoxification of cd in a controlled manner, allowing plants to accumulate metals to high concentrations without damaging normal functions of cells <cit> . these cd detoxification strategies rely on the combined activation of membrane transport and signal transduction pathways, which differ among plant species and among genotypes within a species <cit> . accordingly, gene identification and characterization are fundamental steps for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of plant cd tolerance/accumulation for developing cd-tolerant and low cd accumulation transgenic crops <cit> . molecular approaches have been extensively applied to elucidate how plants respond to cd toxicity <cit> . dna microarray technology has been employed to analyze the transcriptional responses of grey poplar under cd stress <cit> . zhao et al. performed a comparative transcriptome analysis and found that cd stress induced general and specific genes in arabidopsis thaliana roots <cit> . quantitative rt-pcr is often used to validate the data obtained in microarray analyses. the gene expression profile of limonium bicolor under salt stress were confirmed through qrt-pcr experiments <cit> . as an rna-dependent post-transcriptional gene-silencing technique, rna interference represents an ideal alternative to gene disruption in many organisms <cit> . over the past ten years, transgene-induced rnai had been developed as an efficient tool for the functional characterization of plant genes for crop improvement <cit> . for instance, cd accumulation was reduced by about 50 % in the rice grains of rnai-ospcs <dig> transgenic plants with no apparent difference of growth between rnai and parental plants <cit> . zn- and fe-regulated transporter-like protein gene family have been characterized and shown to be expressed through different growth stages of rice. oszip <dig> and oszip <dig> seem to be important for zn uptake from soil, oszip <dig> oszip <dig> and oszip <dig> for root to shoot translocation, while oszip <dig> and oszip <dig> could be particularly important for zn transport to seed <cit> . cadmium translocation occur mainly via the same ca2+, zn2+, fe2+, mn2+ transporters <cit> , so the decrease of root-to-shoot metal translocation could be a major goal in cereals grown in cd contaminated soils. disruption of these transporter genes could prove their function and may suggest a strategy to limit cd accumulation in crops. barley is an established model crop for genetic and physiological studies on abiotic stress tolerance <cit> . in previous studies, we reported comprehensive investigation of physiological and cellular differences between cd-tolerant and sensitive barley genotypes in response to cd stress <cit> . we demonstrated distinctive genotypic difference between low-grain-cd-accumulating and high-grain-cd-accumulating genotypes in response to cd stress <cit> . however, our knowledge of candidate genes related to low grain cd accumulation in these unique barley genotypes is still limited. therefore, we hypothesize that there are large differences in genome-wide response to cd stress and that the functions of some cd-responsive genes are distinct between the two genotypes. in this study, we employed multiple technologies, such as dna microarray, qrt-pcr, rnai, confocal microscopy, atomic absorption spectrometry, and gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence analyses to decipher the mechanisms underlying the differential expression and functions of cd-induced genes in two barley genotypes. our aims were to: elucidate cd distribution in different functional regions and cell types in roots; identify cd-induced differentially expressed genes responsible for low grain cd accumulation and cd tolerance; and characterize the function of zip transporter genes in rnai transgenic barley lines. our results provide significant insights into the complex mechanisms of cd transport, accumulation, and tolerance in barley. RESULTS cd affects a range of physiological parameters in the two contrasting barley genotypes barley plants exposed to cd treatments showed a significant decrease in plant height, root length, and shoot and root dry weight . the symptoms of cd toxicity differed significantly between low-grain-cd-accumulating and high-grain-cd-accumulating genotypes with more severe growth reductions in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype. in 50 μm cd, for instance, shoot dry weight was reduced by <dig> % in w6nk <dig> while it was only <dig> % reduction in zhenong <dig> . after 15 days cd exposure, maximal photochemical efficiency of ps ii , photosynthetic quantum yield of photosystem ii and coefficient of photochemical quenching had decreased significantly under increased cd levels in w6nk <dig> however, the reduction of these parameters in zhenong <dig> was less than in w6nk <dig> . moreover, cd stress induced a significant reduction in net photosynthetic rate , transpiration rate and stomatal conductance in both genotypes . in 500 μm cd, pn was completely inhibited in cd-sensitive genotype w6nk <dig> while zhenong <dig> reduced by <dig> % compared with control . leaf chlorophyll a and b contents were also significantly decreased in both genotypes under the three cd treatments but the reduction of chlorophyll content was smaller in zhenong <dig> than in w6nk <dig> under 50 μm cd . the accumulation and distribution of cd differ significantly between the two genotypes at the tissue and cellular levels cd concentration increased proportional to the elevated external cd levels, with up to 20-fold higher concentrations being observed in roots than the shoots . there were significant genotypic differences in cd concentrations detected in plants in relation to different cd levels, tissues, and regions of roots, except for shoot cd concentrations treated with 5 μm cd after <dig> and 10 days. after exposure to 50 μm and <dig> μm cd both shoot and root cd concentrations in zhenong <dig> were significantly higher than in w6nk <dig> .fig. <dig> effect of cd levels and time of cd exposure on cd concentration in barley shoots and roots. the data are cd concentration in

above results, demonstrating significantly higher cd accumulation in the 1-cm root tips of zhenong <dig> plants in comparison to w6nk <dig> . the preferential location of cd in roots of zhenong <dig> plants treated with 50 μm cd after 5 days was in the root apex, and this effect was more pronounced under increased cd concentrations and exposure times . on the contrary, there was no cd detected by the cd-sensitive fluorescent probe in the root tips of w6nk <dig> plants after 5 days of 50 μm cd treatment. cross-sectional images of roots revealed that most cd accumulated in inner epidermis and endodermis. when the two genotypes were compared, there was more green fluorescence observed in endodermis and cortex of w6nk <dig> while there was stronger green fluorescence in inner epidermis and

genotypes cd stress results in large-scale changes in gene expression the physiological distinctions observed in response to cd stress between the two unique barley genotypes led to further exploitation of their differences at the transcriptome level. overall, we found that compared to the control plants, the gene expression profiles the leaves of two genotypes were significantly altered after 15 days in 5 μm cd. cadmium stress induced differential expression of <dig> genes. among these genes, <dig> and <dig> were up-regulated in w6nk <dig> and zhenong <dig> respectively, with a fold change of at least <dig> . these genes represented <dig> and <dig> % of the total genes in the two genotypes . there were distinct differences in gene expression between the two genotypes , with <dig> genes being up-regulated in w6nk <dig> but unchanged in zhenong <dig> , while another <dig> genes were up-regulated in w6nk <dig> , but down-regulated in zhenong <dig> .table <dig> membrane transport related genes up-regulated in w6nk <dig> and down-regulated or no change in zhenong <dig> after 15 days exposure to 5 μm cd the differentially regulated cd-responsive genes were clustered into <dig> categories according to the similarities in their expression profiles . among the genes that were up-regulated in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype w6nk <dig> but down-regulated or unchanged in zhenong <dig> or no change in w6nk <dig> but down-regulated in zhenong <dig> 27 % were related to stress and defense responses and 11 % represented functions related to transport . the genes that were up-regulated in the high-grain-cd-accumulating genotype zhenong <dig> but down-regulated or unchanged in w6nk <dig> or unchanged in zhenong <dig> but down-regulated in w6nk <dig> except for unknown classified and none function sections the largest portion with 15 % was related to photosynthesis, followed by transcription with 13 % . the genes that were up-regulated in both genotypes were mainly involved in stress and defense responses and carbohydrate metabolism except for category with unknown function . furthermore, the genes that were down-regulated in both genotypes mainly involved in unknown classified and none function sections, followed by photosynthesis , stress and defense responses equal to transcription and transport , meanwhile, there were a small amount genes related to protein synthesis, signal transduction and so on . cd stress leads to higher expression of genes involved in transport, stress and defense responses, carbohydrate metabolism and signal transduction in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype the most relevant group related to low grain cd accumulation were the genes up-regulated in cd-sensitive w6nk <dig> and down-regulated or unchanged in cd-tolerant zhenong <dig> plants, or unchanged in w6nk <dig> but down-regulated in zhenong <dig> . among them, category <dig> contained <dig> transport related genes . a closer inspection of the genes involved in transport revealed that they were expressed at a significantly higher level in w6nk <dig> than in zhenong <dig> under cd treatment. for instance, cd-induced fold changes in the transcript levels of zinc transporter <dig> and a putative abc transporter were <dig> and <dig> , respectively, in w6nk <dig> whereas they were − <dig> and − <dig> in zhenong <dig> moreover, the transcripts of two macronutrient transporters were highly expressed in w6nk <dig> under cd stress, showing <dig> and <dig> fold changes, respectively . category <dig> contained <dig> stress and defense

higher expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, protein synthesis and transcription in the high-grain-cd-accumulating genotype interestingly, we found that genes that were higher expressed in cd-tolerant zhenong <dig> plants were very different from those in w6nk <dig> . they included <dig> genes that were up-regulated in zhenong <dig> and down-regulated or no change in w6nk <dig> or unchanged in zhenong <dig> and down-regulated in w6nk <dig> the numbers of these genes involved in different processes as follows: photosynthesis , transcription , protein synthesis , transport , and stress and defense responses . the cd-induced expression of some key genes was many fold higher under cd treatment vs. the control in zhenong <dig> than in w6nk <dig> . for examples the changes of genes expression level encoding proteins such as plastid-specific ribosomal protein <dig> precursor were <dig> folds, ribonucleo protein <dig> folds, rubisco large subunit-binding protein beta subunit <dig> folds, lipid transfer protein <dig> folds and adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphatase <dig> folds. we assumed that they could be related to cd accumulation. there were <dig> genes up-regulated in both w6nk <dig> and zhenong <dig> after 15 days exposure to 5 μm cd, of which 23 % were related to stress and defense response, 19 % to carbohydrate metabolism . aside, <dig> genes were down-regulated in both w6nk <dig> and zhenong <dig> after cd exposure, however 72 % of them were unknown classified . the differential expression of transporter genes are verified via qrt-pcr to verify the microarray data, we selected <dig> representative genes from different gene categories. the primers targeting these genes are listed in additional file 12: table s <dig> expression analysis of selected genes via quantitative real time pcr confirmed the transcript levels observed in dna microarray . nineteen representative genes showed consistently higher expression levels in w6nk <dig> compared to zhenong <dig> for instance, the average relative expression of two zip genes in w6nk <dig> was approximately <dig> times higher than in zhenong <dig> after cd treatment . silencing hvzips leads to significantly higher accumulation of cd and a reduction of zn and mn in barley grains as zip genes are key transporters of toxic cd and the essential minerals zn and mn, we utilized rnai technology to further investigate whether disruption of these genes at mrna level affects cd and mineral accumulation in barley grains. in this experiment, a highly conserved portion of the hvzip gene was cloned into the pstargate vector . we made three rnai constructs, harboring hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> isolated from w6nk <dig> and hvzip <dig> isolated from zhenong <dig> and transgenic lines were generated. out of <dig> transformed immature barley embryos, <dig> transgenic lines were regenerated and <dig> transgenic barley lines showed the presence of hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> antisense sequences detected via pcr. the expression of the antisense transcripts from the hvzip rnai constructs in the transgenic barley primary transformants and the next generation lines were evaluated and compared to that in the parental cv. golden promise using qrt-pcr . the relative expression in cv. golden promise was set to <dig> as a reference for estimation of the relative expression level of hvzip <dig> or hvzip <dig> in the rnai lines. the relative expression levels in the rnai lines were <dig> to <dig> -fold lower than in the parental plants, and the w6nk <dig> zip3- <dig> and zhenong <dig> zip8- <dig> lines showed the highest transcript levels of hvzip3and hvzip <dig> respectively . the relative expression of zip in next generation lines revealed similar results as was observed in the primary transformants . the levels of cd and two related microelements, zn and mn, were then determined in parental barley and the t <dig> rnai grains . the cd concentrations in all of the rnai grains were significantly increased, by up to 70 % compared to parental cv. golden promise plants. in addition, the cd level in the zip <dig> line was much lower than in the six zip <dig> lines excepted for w6nk2-zip8- <dig> line. in contrast, the silencing of hvzips resulted in a significant decrease in zn and mn concentrations in all of the t <dig> rnai grains, with the exception of the zn concentration in the zhenong zip8- <dig> line . examination of cd concentration in t <dig> transgenic grains have conformed this results. both under control and cd added conditions, concentrations of cd in grains of transgenic lines were significantly higher than that in parental line. similarly, the concentrations of zn and mn in grains of transgenic lines showed a significant reduction compared to the parental line. in addition, the cd concentration in all of the t <dig> transgenic grains under cd treatment was significantly higher than that under normal condition . however, the zn and mn concentrations under cd treatment were lower than under normal condition .fig. <dig> concentrations of cd, zn and mn in grains of different zip-rnai lines and the parental barley under normal

artificial contamination of 5 mg kg− <dig> cd in soil silencing hvzips leads to change of grain ultrastructure scanning electron microscopy observations showed that the central endosperm of barley grains that were exposed to cd was packed with a- and b-type starch granules with some protein matrix that surrounded the large a-type starch granules and engulfed the smaller b-type starch granules . compared with the parental cultivar, when exposed to cd, a-type granules in transgenic lines exhibited much more serious surface erosion or deformation. furthermore, the proportion of b-type starch granule was lower in transgenic lines than that in parental cultivar. it was noted that some large starch-associated proteins accumulated around the starch granules of transgenic lines, while very few were observed in wild type. additionally, it was noted that some large protein-rich deposits accumulated around the starch granules of transgenic lines. in contrast, very few deposits were observed in golden promise.fig. <dig> scanning electron microscopy image of matured grains. the sem images illustrate the starch–protein interface in the parental line compared to the t <dig> transgenic grains .

cd-tolerant barley genotypes? cadmium contamination remains a potential threat to human health due to its long biological half-life and easy uptake by plants. overall cd tolerance but low cd accumulation in grains are important characteristics in cereals and considered as two key traits related to cd toxicity <cit> . however, as it was reported previously and reinforced in the present study, these two traits do not always co-exist in a single species or genotype <cit> . cd stress caused a significant decrease in growth, photosynthesis, pigment levels and yields in both studied genotypes, with w6nk <dig> being more strongly affected . in addition, cd-tolerant zhenong <dig> showed significantly higher cd accumulation in shoots and various regions of roots than w6nk <dig> . these results were in accord with our previous studies <cit> . therefore, our comprehensive transcriptome analysis of these contrasting genotypes provided insights into the molecular mechanisms and genes responsible for the cd tolerance but low cd accumulation traits in barley. compared to other crop species , barley possesses high genetic diversity <cit> and shows higher tolerance to many abiotic stresses, such as drought <cit> , salinity <cit> , and acidic soils <cit> . the work on tibetan wild barley has shown some promising results regarding the identification of low-grain-cd-accumulating and cd-tolerant genotypes <cit> . seventy percent of <dig> examined tibetan wild barley lines are more salt-tolerant than the well-known salt tolerant elite cultivar cm <dig> most of these highly salt-tolerant lines accumulate significantly less na+ than the cultivated barley genotypes <cit> . if similar mechanisms also apply to cd tolerance, it is our interest to further investigate these wild lines for potential use in breeding to obtain low-grain-cd-accumulating and cd-tolerant genotypes. comparative transcriptome analysis reveals key transporter genes associated with low cd accumulation to our knowledge, no detailed molecular evaluation of low cd accumulation has previously been conducted in barley. in this study, many genes were differentially induced in w6nk <dig> and zhenong <dig> in response to cd stress . based on the identified cd-responsive transporter genes, we were able to produce an integrated schematic diagram of the potential mechanisms involved in low cd accumulation . this has provided some novel clues to the molecular mechanisms underlying low cd accumulation in barley. our previous studies demonstrated that zn interferes with cd uptake and translocation and significantly alleviates cd stress in barley <cit> . at the molecular level, the toxicity of cd to plants is generally finely regulated by many membrane transporters <cit> . in this study, genes encoding more than <dig> of these membrane transporters, including three members of the zip transporter family: zinc transporter <dig> the zinc transporter zip <dig> and a zip-like zinc transporter, were found to be highly expressed in w6nk <dig> plants under cd stress . hence, the zip transporters are crucial for the transport of both essential micronutrients and non-essential heavy metals such as cd . recently, milner et al. found that <dig> out of the <dig> arabidopsis zip family members complement a yeast zn uptake-deficient mutant. atzip <dig> and atzip <dig> are zn and mn transporters present at the root stele tonoplast and plasma membrane, respectively <cit> . our results in agreement with these findings and showed that the levels of cd, zn and mn are significantly affected in zip-rnai barley lines . in addition, atp-binding cassette transporter family is responsible for the transport of heavy metals, xenobiotics and lipids, and its members are involved in the vacuolar sequestration, distribution and homeostasis of cd in plants <cit> . for example, disruption of atmrp <dig> leads to changes in guard cell anion levels and calcium channel activity in arabidopsis <cit> . in this study, the transcripts encoding four abc transporters were significantly highly expressed in w6nk <dig> than in zhenong <dig> . we therefore propose that w6nk <dig> might be more efficient in vacuolar cd sequestration and cd extrusion from cells in the shoots and roots, resulting in lower cd accumulation in barley grain compared to zhenong <dig> tightly regulated transporters of essential nutrients such as ammonium, k, fe and phosphate and ph homeostasis are essential for plant performance under cd stress. among the eight p-type atpases found in arabidopsis, hma <dig> and hma <dig> are essential for the transport and root-to-shoot translocation of zn and cd <cit> . in this study, the observed cd-induced up-regulation of genes encoding two p-type atpases in w6nk <dig> may indicate its efficiency in reducing grain cd concentration . moreover, we detected cd-induced up-regulation of genes encoding iron transporter yellow stripe 1-like , a potassium transporter , an ammonium transporter and a phosphate translocator only in w6nk <dig> . under cd stress, nitrogen can be recycled and translocated from the shoots to roots as a cd protection and storage strategy, with ammonium representing the preferred form of nitrogen <cit> . a recent publication shows that the arabidopsis nitrate transporter nrt <dig> functions in the removal of nitrate from the xylem sap and mediates cadmium tolerance <cit> . plasma membrane ktps contribute to cellular homeostasis and excitability in higher plants <cit> . a significantly negative relationship has been discovered between fe and cd concentrations <cit> , and iron deficiency stimulates heavy metal transport in plants <cit> . it has been suggested that yellow stripe <dig> and zmys <dig> play unique roles in delivering a broad range of essential metals in barley and maize <cit> . in summary, the cd-induced up-regulation of these transporters may contribute to the low grain cd accumulation observed in w6nk <dig> through the direct transport of cd via zip and abc transporters and through indirect regulation of ammonium, k, fe, phosphate and ph homeostasis. in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype hence the up-regulation of these transporters may contribute to the low grain cd accumulation perhaps by limiting the export to of cd being accumulated in vegetative tissues and less in the grains. from the other hand the down-regulation of the same transporters in the high-grain-cd-accumulating genotype could have led to the cd to be exported to the grains. cd-tolerant genotype utilizes different strategies at the transcriptome level for combating cd stress in the present work, many unique genes were found to be up-regulated in cd-tolerant genotype zhenong <dig> in response to cd stress . based on the identified cd-responsive genes, an integrated schematic diagram of the mechanisms related to cd tolerance was proposed . this integrated schematic diagram of cd-tolerance-related genes may provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cd tolerance in barley, in contrast to the mechanisms that are relevant to low grain cd accumulation. the cd-tolerant genotype zhenong <dig> showed several strategies that were very different from those observed in w6nk <dig> but were effective in altering its transcriptome in response to cd stress. twenty-nine photosynthesis-related genes were found to be up-regulated in zhenong <dig> but unchanged or down-regulated in w6nk <dig> under cd treatment and the up-regulation of these genes was translated into 6-fold higher net co <dig> assimilation . the negative impact of cd on photosynthesis is well documented <cit> . as the most abundant protein in plants, rubisco catalyzes the first step in co <dig> assimilation and photo respiratory carbon oxidation <cit> . here, we identified candidate genes encoding large and small subunits of rubisco that were up-regulated, showing up to 20-fold changes, in cd-tolerant zhenong <dig> plants under cd treatment. ferredoxin nadp oxidoreductases catalyze electron transfer between nadp and ferredoxin. knockout of atlfnr <dig> decreases the contents of chlorophyll and light-harvesting complex proteins and markedly reduces the psi/psii ratio in the mutant compared to wild-type plants <cit> . additionally, other genes, encoding nadph-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase b, psbp and psbp-related thylakoid lumenal proteins, may also play key roles in the improvement of photosynthesis in zhenong <dig> under cd treatment. many stress defense signalling related genes encoding jasmonate- and ethylene- forming-enzyme-like proteins and calcium-dependent protein kinases were found to be up-regulated in zhenong <dig> these genes have been well characterized regarding the roles in abiotic stress tolerance <cit> . ja, et and ca signals play significant roles in the adaption of plants under various stresses, both independently and through synergistic and antagonistic cross-talk <cit> . cd stress triggers the accumulation of ja and et in arabidopsis and beans, respectively <cit> . fuhrer et al. reported that under cd-induced stress, ethylene restricts the water and cd flux into bean leaves <cit> . additionally, the ca2+-binding protein calmodulin transduces second messengers in cellular responses <cit> . cd may enter cells via ca2+-selective channels or specific transmembrane transporters to compete with ca2+ for cam-binding sites, resulting in a reduced ability of plants to sense stress signals <cit> . our results indicated that cd induced a greater increase in the expression of genes related to stress defense signaling in zhenong <dig> compared to w6nk <dig> which could contribute the cd tolerance of zhenong <dig> among the <dig> protein synthesis genes that were up-regulated in zhenong <dig> and down-regulated in w6nk <dig> in response to cd <dig> encoded ribosomal proteins and their precursors. protein synthesis is critical for abiotic stress tolerance in plants <cit> . pytharopouloua et al. suggested that under cd2+-mediated stress, protein-synthesizing activity is reorganized both quantitatively and qualitatively, and cu2+ causes a progressive loss of the ability of 40s-ribosomal subunits to form the 48s pre-initiation complex, decreasing to 34 % of the control level at the end of exposure <cit> . plastid ribosomal proteins are essential for ribosome biogenesis, plastid protein biosynthesis, chloroplast differentiation, and early chloroplast development, and nuclear-encoded prps <dig> plays an important role in chloroplast development in rice <cit> . prps are crucial for the establishment of the transcription/translation apparatus during the build-up step in chloroplast differentiation in maize <cit> . a lack of prps has diverse phenotypic effects in plants, including decreased photosynthetic capacity, reduced plant height or even lethality <cit> . our finding suggested that ribosomal proteins are crucial for cd tolerance in barley as well. finally, in this study, h+-atpase, atp synthase and atp-sulfurylase encoded by detoxification-related genes were found to be up-regulated in zhenong <dig> but down-regulated in w6nk <dig> . the cd-induced high expression of these genes may be one of the important components of cd tolerance in zhenong <dig> heavy metals could alter membrane permeability properties and inhibit both proton transport and h+-atpase activity, and the regulation of this enzyme may therefore be relevant to cd tolerance <cit> . the cation antiporter activity driven by the vacuolar atpase-dependent proton motive force contributes significantly to the detoxification of cd via vacuolar compartmentalization in plants <cit> . in addition, cd has a high affinity for metabolic processes related to sulfur metabolism via atp- sulfurylase and adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate sulfotransferase <cit> . once cd enters the cytosol, another system strictly related to sulfur metabolism is promptly activated to produce phytochelatins for cd detoxification <cit> . suppression of hvzip expression using antisense constructs confirms the role of hvzips in high accumulation of cd in barley grains our microarray data provided strong evidence that up-regulation of genes encoding zip and many other membrane transporters was crucial for reducing cd accumulation in w6nk <dig> both directly and indirectly . we investigated whether rnai-mediated silencing of hvzips could lead to high cd accumulation, constituting an opposite effect. indeed, hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> antisense lines showed a large increase in cd accumulation and a significant decrease in the zn and mn concentrations in barley grain . zip transporters are involved in zn, fe, mn and cd homeostasis <cit> . the rice zip transporter family has been shown to have diverse functions in zn uptake in different tissues and cell types <cit> . additionally, over-expression of arabidopsis atzip <dig> zn transporter in barley results in increases in short-term zn uptake and grain zn contents <cit> . the results with hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> rnai lines suggested that up-regulation or over-expression of hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> genes may result in lower cd transport and accumulation. further efforts will be devoted to comprehensively characterizing each of these transporter genes and their potential roles in both low cd accumulation and cd tolerance. CONCLUSIONS together with comprehensive physiological analysis of the two contrasting barley genotypes, microarray analysis of the complex cd-induced gene expression pattern and zip rnai transgenic analysis provided new insights contributing to a more in-depth understanding of the low cd accumulation and cd tolerance observed in two contrasting barley genotypes. cd stress resulted in large-scale changes in gene expression, which differed substantially between the two genotypes. cd stress led to higher expression of genes related to transport, carbohydrate metabolism and signal transduction in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype w6nk <dig> whereas it up-regulated genes involved in photosynthesis, protein synthesis, stress anddefense responses and transcription in the high-grain-cd-accumulating, cd-tolerant genotype zhenong <dig> in addition, it was suggested that the cd-induced high expression of genes encoding zip and abc transporters is associated with low cd accumulation in barley. rnai analysis further validated the functions of hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> related to low grain cd accumulation. the results illustrated that many of these transporters could be applied in biotechnology to decrease cd accumulation in grains and improve cd tolerance in barley. however, elucidating the mechanisms underlying cd stress accumulation and tolerance in barley remains an ambitious endeavor for future research.",

    "prompt": "Generate a synopsis highlighting key symptoms and interventions. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND high density oligonucleotide microarrays are widely used in many areas of biological research for quantitative, high-throughput measurements of gene expression. although ultra-deep sequencing techniques promise to replace them in the near future <cit> , it would be a mistake to ignore the biological importance of the massive quantity of data already produced through this platform. publicly available databases alone store a huge quantity of microarray experiments , comprising hundreds of different species. among microarrays, the single-channel affymetrix genechip platform <cit> is by far the most popular . in this technology each transcript is typically measured by a set of 11- <dig> pairs of <dig> bases-long probes, collectively referred to as \"probeset\". for every \"perfect match\" probe , affymetrix chips contain a \"mismatch\" counterpart , with a single nucleotide change in the middle of the pm probe sequence. the role of mm probes, located adjacent to the respective pm, is to measure probe-specific background signal associated to any perfect-match signal intensity. in general, the process of obtaining a single gene expression value out of raw probe intensity measurements is called \"microarray preprocessing\". three steps are usually required: background correction, normalization and summarization. many different methods or combinations of methods were proposed over the years <cit> . the most popular manufacturer-provided method, mas <dig> <cit> , uses a scale normalization approach, then corrects the background by subtracting the mean intensity of the lowest 2% spots in every microarray region, and then mm intensities from the respective pm ones. wherever mm intensity is higher than a pm one, in order to avoid negative signal intensities typical of the mas <dig> predecessor, mas <dig> <cit> , mas <dig> replaces the mm signal with an \"idealized mismatch\" value derived from other values in the same probeset. to extract final probeset intensities, mas <dig> calculates a robust average of all the contained probes. many alternative techniques have challenged mas <dig> supremacy for preprocessing. being a single-array technique, mas <dig> doesn't model probes' behaviour across different samples, and therefore suffers from high variance and is theoretically less robust than multi-array algorithms <cit> . two of the most popular multi-array normalization techniques are rma <cit> and gcrma <cit> . rma doesn't use information contained in mm probes, and calculates background signal by performing a modelled global correction of all pm intensities. then it applies a quantile normalization step and a median polish summarization, which accounts for probe intensities over multiple arrays. gcrma applies the same normalization and summarization steps as rma, but it differs in the background correction method, which is based on the probe sequence. other multi-array methods which don't discard mm intensities exist, one of them being dchip <cit> . however, in the present paper we will focus on rma, gcrma and mas <dig> which are possibly the most popular microarray normalization methods <cit> . their popularity is illustrated by the fact that they are the most popular normalization techniques in online databases <cit> . most benchmarks have tried to assess the quality of different preprocessing methods in differential gene expression scenarios, the original purpose for which microarrays were developed <cit> . to do so, golden set spike-in samples were used, with known concentrations of transcripts <cit> , or real time pcr measurements were performed for comparison <cit> . the outcome of these benchmarks has not identified any technique as the top performer, although single-array techniques such as mas <dig> have been outperformed by multi-array ones such as rma <cit> . however, many different approaches to biological investigation have relied on microarrays, ranging from gene and sample clustering <cit> to gene-gene network reverse-engineering <cit> , from sample classification <cit> to global transcript models <cit> . the field of microarray data correlation and clustering based on the principle of coexpression has developed at a quite considerable pace <cit> ; despite this, the effects of preprocessing on coexpression analyses have been generally overlooked, with a few exceptions. <cit> used bacterial operons to validate the different normalization techniques for correlation analysis and concluded that a combination of different methods works best. on the other hand, <cit> have pointed out how the use of the multi-array techniques rma and gcrma can yield inter-array correlation artifacts and generally lower quality networks than the older mas <dig> in particular, a specific step in gcrma background correction has been identified as partially responsible for the spurious correlations generated by gcrma. notably however, the correction of this step is not sufficient to remove all artifact effects, and no explanation was provided for artifacts produced by rma. in the present paper, we extend the analysis performed by <cit> , aiming to shed more light on the behaviour of multi-array techniques specifically in the context of inter-array correlation. we will describe the characteristics of probesets which induce these artifacts and provide both a mathematical and a biological explanation for the phenomenon. finally, we introduce a slightly changed version of the rma code which massively reduces inter-array correlation artifacts, while retaining rma features in the context of differential gene expression analysis. RESULTS multi-array preprocessing effects in order to compare the behaviour of three of the most popular microarray preprocessing techniques , lim and colleagues <cit> , tested these on a single dataset of <dig> microarrays hybridized with human samples. we extended this analysis on a considerably larger arabidopsis thaliana dataset comprising <dig> microarrays, selecting different sample sizes , according to the realistic size of a single experiment dataset . first, we calculated inter-array correlations on randomly selected groups of original arrays . the plots show us that many genes' relative expression will remain constant across different treatments and genotypes, indicating a certain robustness of arabidopsis' genetic machinery in varying environmental conditions and other perturbations . the sample size doesn't seem to influence the high correlation between arrays, although some evident oscillations could be detected for rma and gcrma at lower sample sizes. the comparison of the three preprocessing methods shows that rma and gcrma yield somewhat more similar microarray expression values than the affymetrix algorithm mas <dig> in order to compare real data with a null dataset, we analyzed the behaviour of the three preprocessing techniques on permutated arrays . since permutated arrays are entirely shuffled and uninformative, we expect them to be, on average, not correlated at all. however as previously reported by lim and colleagues <cit> , this is not the case for the non-affymetrix techniques we used . rma and gcrma show a high mean inter-array correlation, which is decreasing with the sample size and this correlation is also much higher for odd sample sizes, and reminiscent of the oscillating behaviour in real arrays . average values for figure <dig> are shown in table <dig> in order to assess if these artifacts were due to the choice of correlation coefficient we repeated our analysis using pearson's and lin's correlation, but obtained nearly identical results . average inter-array correlation coefficients at different sample sizes, using three different normalization procedures. mas <dig> alone shows the expected no-correlation behaviour. it must be noted that, unlike the other two techniques, mas <dig> uses a single-array summarization technique which treats each sample separately. we will focus on the cause of this behaviour observed when using rma and gcrma, trying to understand the mathematical and biological scenarios that could introduce such a massive artificial inter-array correlation for these two methods. causes of rma and gcrma artifact generation we have already seen that the introduction of artificial similarities between arrays by rma and gcrma is particularly strong for small and odd sample sizes. in figure <dig> we show how adding an increasing amount of noise to microarray samples in the arabidopsis dataset results in the expected loss-of-correlation behaviour for mas <dig> gcrma and rma for an even sample size . however, for sample size <dig> , rma and gcrma actually add inter-array correlation as noise is combined with the biological signal. the situation is still atypical for the next odd sample size . returning to our original arabidopsis dataset, we observed that many probesets seem to yield completely identical values across different samples when processed by rma or gcrma. datasets of three arrays normalized by rma and gcrma show, respectively, around 20% and 12% of the probesets population with identical values across all samples. the effect will decrease with increasing sample size as previously reported in <cit> . we therefore measured the tendency to yield identical expression estimates for any particular probeset after rma normalization and compared it to several probeset characteristics. the id tendency is inversely correlated to the probeset internal consistency , which we measured using the fit of the probeset to a linear model that measures concordance between probes. this phenomenon is also particularly evident for lowly expressed probesets and those hybridizing to multiple targets , especially if the different targets fall into different biological classes . in summary, rma and gcrma tend to yield identical values for probesets containing probes that yield grossly different measurements across samples, and therefore are either noise-driven or have multiple independent targets. as the problem of bad probesets has been discussed before and been tackled by providing updated probeset definitions in the customcdf project <cit> , we assessed whether the oscillating behaviour for real data was still observable when using such an updated definition. however, qualitatively identical results were still obtained using such an updated probeset annotation . this might be explained by the fact that expression is also inversely correlated to a probesets' tendency to give identical values across arrays. taken together, these results tell us that rma introduce artificial correlation across microarrays driven by lowly expressed, internally inconsistent, multi-target and/or multi-function probesets. median polish inconsistency rma <cit> and the closely related method, gcrma <cit> , differ only in the initial background correction step. since the same effect is present in both methods , we reasoned that the artifact generation should depend on either the shared normalization step , or on the probe summarization step . we concluded that the effect cannot arise from quantile normalization, since substituting it by scale normalization or removing it completely yields qualitatively identical plots whereas the inclusion of a median polish step always introduced the effect, regardless of background correction and normalization procedures . the shared artifact can therefore only be generated within the median polish summarization step. indeed, substituting the median polish step with any other alternative available in the bioconductor rma implementation eliminates the artificial inter-array correlation effect . as an example of multi-array summarization, we substituted the rma default summarization with the robust least squares linear model summarization, described by <cit> , and show that this procedure almost completely removes inter-array correlation . on the other hand, as an example of single-array summarization, we used rma with an \"average of log\" summarization, which simply computes the average of the logarithms of probe intensities for every probeset. this single-array summarization yields a predictable <dig> correlation among all arrays . to identify why this artifact arises during the median polish procedure, we investigated the algorithm further. rma and gcrma apply median polish by creating a matrix from the measured values within each probeset, placing probes along each row, and samples along each column. the medians are subtracted from the intensities to cumulate residuals in each step and the grand effect is subtracted from medians to cumulate probe effects in each step . this algorithm is more likely to introduce identical values with odd and small sample sizes, like the one depicted in additional file <dig> figure s <dig> in such a case, the row medians will fall on a specific value and be transformed to zero during the first row sweep , this will increase the chance to have a zero as column median during column sweep . overall, the rma implementation of the median polish algorithm shrinks all values in the probeset matrix to similar or identical values, with a stronger effect for samples, since it starts subtracting probe medians. in the example of additional file <dig> figure s <dig> the final sample values will be calculated by adding the grand effect to each column effect, and will therefore be equal to <dig> for all samples. it could be argued that the median polish summarization step could be helpful in the context of differential gene expression analysis, since it will flatten unclear probeset matrices and therefore highlight strong signals. however, the result of generating completely identical expression values across arrays is not always beneficial. moreover, this effect can be dramatically reduced by swapping the order of row/column median subtraction within median polish, or equivalently, by transposing the matrix created for each probeset, placing samples on rows and probes on columns. this alteration will introduce a presumably harmless similarity between probes within a probeset while massively reducing the artificial sample identity. to confirm this, we re-implemented the median polish summarization by inverting the order of the two sweep steps , in what we call \"transposed rma\" or trma. as shown in figure <dig> the inversion of median subtraction steps alone reduces the median polish effect to a very small residual inter-array correlation. this can be explained by the fact that the likelihood for the sample effects to give a zero value in trma is very low during the first iteration, as it would require perfectly identical medians of raw probe values . effectively, trma transfers the artifact of inter-correlation between sample to an inter-correlation between probe effects, which might be more plausible biologically and remains contained within the procedure and not yielded as output of the preprocessing method. the inter-array artificial correlation effect introduced by the median polish step is increased in gcrma . as previously discussed by <cit> , gcrma contains a potential problem in its background correction step, that adjusts probe intensity values through gene-specific binding. this introduces artificial inter-array correlations between probes with similar binding affinity, and therefore strengthens the effect of the following summarization step. however, substituting the median polish step with our transposed alternative \"tgcrma\" , massively reduces the inter-array correlation between permutated samples. comparison between rma and trma in biological contexts the affycomp open challenge benchmark <cit> is a well known tool to evaluate summaries of affymetrix probe level data, based on known concentration of transcripts in the so-called \"spike-in\" experiments by affymetrix <cit> . in order to demonstrate that our trma procedure still performs nearly as well as the original rma implementation, we used the latest implementation of the affycomp benchmark to compare the performance of the original rma with our trma implementation. in table <dig> we show some of the most relevant scores, as calculated for the hgu <dig> affymetrix spike-in series. affycompii most indicative results for mas <dig> rma and trma, spike-in hgu <dig> dataset. differences between rma and trma are trivial, especially when compared to other methods . the differences between rma and trma are minor when compared to the results for an independent method : trma shares most of the qualities of rma, without introducing inter-array correlations. it is interesting to highlight the fact that trma yields a higher median standard deviation between spike-in replicates. this effect can be wrongly interpreted as trma's lower sensitivity; however, we now know that the original rma median polish implementation is introducing identical values across experiments, and therefore artificially reducing the variance between spike-in replicates as well. since median polish alters inter-array correlation, sample classification is a common analysis that could be affected by this summarization step. thus, we analyzed the atgenexpress stress dataset for arabidopsis <cit> , and calculated the capability of both preprocessing techniques to separate roots and shoots samples . as can be seen in figure 5a, trma outperforms rma as it increases the distance between different tissue samples , while keeping similar low distances between samples coming from the same tissue . as variance filtering is a common procedure for microarray clustering, we used only the 50% most varying genes in every subset and obtained similar results . it can be concluded that trma increases the capability to discern different array conditions, when only a small number of microarrays have been used. in order to compare the relative performance of rma and trma when filtering on differentially expressed genes, we used a dataset that was previously used by <cit> , to tune classification where the origin of the rna in each sample was known. choosing a sample size of <dig> where <dig> pairs of <dig> samples each came from the same specimen and one sample came from a different specimen, trma yields better classification results for almost all fdr corrected p-value thresholds . however, when filtering out lowly expressed genes <cit> , rma performed generally as well as trma when performing sample classification on this dataset . unlike for the tissue sample dataset, rma performed better than trma when filtering based on variance in this use case even when adding random noise to all samples . only when noise was selectively added to non-paired samples did trma outperform rma . furthermore, rma performs slightly better than trma in <dig> out of <dig> of the affycomp tests shown. although objectively minor, these differences point out that trma may not necessarily be an improvement over rma in all types of analyses. discussion the use of gcrma and rma preprocessing algorithms for affymetrix genechip technology has received a remarkably broad adoption in the community due to their low computation time and to their superiority with respect to other methods in previous benchmarks. however, one of the most relevant advantage of rma and gcrma in the affycompii challenge <cit> , the low variance across replicates, seems to be partially the result of artificial inter-array correlation. extending what was already noted by <cit> , we show that the artificially high similarity between samples given by rma and gcrma is caused by the shared median polish summarization step. this artificial behaviour is particularly strong in internally inconsistent, noise-driven and multi-hit probesets, and as a consequence identical results across arrays are generated. we analyzed this artifact effect for the arabidopsis thaliana ath <dig> affymetrix genechip, but we found highly similar results in exploratory experiments on other organisms and platforms . the median polish step doesn't seem to pose a particular problem in differential gene expression analyses, because, on the contrary, it could enhance the differences of changing transcripts by shrinking most unclear probesets to identical values across experiments. in any case, the small underlying change in gene expression of such an unclear probeset would generally be below the cut-off value to be considered an 'interesting' gene. it is interesting to note, however, that median polish has already been shown to work poorly when compared to mas <dig> summarization in correlation between e. coli operon members <cit> . however, this artificial correlation can't be ignored in contexts where unbiased measurements are needed, like transcript clustering <cit> , genetic network reverse-engineering <cit> , sample classification <cit> or global transcript models <cit> , and we show in the present paper how rma can artificially decrease the gap between samples coming from different tissue types. furthermore, we could show that filtering of differentially expressed genes leads to a worse sample classification performance for small odd sample sizes samples for rma, when compared to trma. nevertheless, depending on the use case, rma performed better when filtering based on variance. thus, our results raise issues, especially when small sample sizes are used, on the validity of many studies obtained on the basis of correlation measures after these normalization procedures were applied. CONCLUSIONS we propose a minor change to the median polish algorithm that will almost eliminate the correlation artifacts without significantly affecting any of the positive rma/gcrma qualities. we provide a modified version of rma named trma as a standalone r package . the method contains a modified version of the bioconductor <cit> preprocesscore and affy packages that alter the median polish summarization step as described in additional file <dig> figure s <dig> . our trma method will offer the possibility to use an unbiased normalization technique both for differential gene expression analyses and for correlative studies based on microarray data.",

    "prompt": "Create a concise summary for rapid clinical decision-making. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND temperament refers to stable patterns of emotions, thoughts and behaviors, which are observable in early childhood and appear to be biologically-based. most models of temperament include a construct related to distress and avoidance . the temperament construct of behavioral inhibition, or \"inhibited temperament\", is defined as the predisposition for a person to respond to new people, places or things with wariness or avoidance behaviors <cit> . inhibited individuals are likely to show wary, avoidant, or fearful responses to novelty. in contrast, uninhibited individuals typically respond to new people and things with positive approach behaviors. inhibited temperament has a well-characterized phenotype and is associated with increased risk for both social anxiety disorder <cit> and major depression <cit> . the study of inhibited temperament may thus provide clues about a specific developmental trajectory for anxiety and depressive disorders. based on its reactivity to novelty and other types of uncertainty, individual differences in amygdala functioning have been proposed as a neural substrate of inhibited temperament <cit> . the amygdala's response to faces may be particularly salient for inhibited temperament, given the heightened risk for social anxiety. face stimuli strongly elicit amygdala responses <cit> , with several studies suggesting the response is modulated by individual differences in inhibited temperament <cit> . for example, schwartz and colleagues <cit> found that young adults who had been identified as behaviorally inhibited during childhood showed greater amygdala activation to novel relative to newly familiar faces, compared to those who were behaviorally uninhibited. these results support the involvement of the amygdala in mediating temperamental differences, but do not address whether there are any differences in the temporal dynamics, or timing, of the amygdala response, such as latency, duration, and peak. individual differences in the temporal dynamics of emotional response, or \"affective chronometry\", have been suggested as an important component of affective style <cit> ; for example, a typical pattern of emotional response might be characterized as a \"quick temper\" or being able to \"recover quickly\" from negative emotions. differences in the time course of behavioral affective responses have been associated with individual differences in both introversion/extraversion <cit> and depression <cit> . these individual differences in the time course of affective responses presumably reflect differences in the temporal dynamics of brain regions supporting emotional responses, such as the amygdala. we are not aware of any studies of temperamental differences in the temporal dynamics of amygdala response, although a finding from the anxiety literature highlights the potential importance of studying temporal dynamics. amygdala latency and magnitude for people with a spider phobia were compared to non-phobic participants in an event-related fmri study <cit> . participants viewed pictures of spiders and neutral pictures. spider phobics had shorter latencies to respond to the pictures of spiders than the nonphobic participants, even though the magnitude of the amygdala's activation did not differ between the two groups. similar to spider phobics, persons with inhibited temperament can be considered to have neophobia, or a fear of novelty. neophobic responses are not necessarily identical to simple phobic responses, as they are both more generalized and often weaker in intensity, but they nevertheless involve clear perception of certain stimuli as potentially threatening, and engender avoidance responses. to the extent that these phobias reflect a similar neurobiology, persons with inhibited temperament may be predicted to have faster amygdala responses to novel stimuli. in this study, we used a slow event-related fmri paradigm to measure the temporal dynamics--latency, duration, and peak--of amygdala response to novel neutral faces compared to newly familiarized neutral faces in persons with inhibited or uninhibited temperament. the event-related paradigm allows estimation of the temporal dynamics of the blood oxygen level dependent signal in a specific region. we hypothesized that inhibited participants would have an amygdala response characterized by shorter latency when viewing novel compared to familiar neutral faces. given that magnitude differences have been observed in past studies of inhibited <cit> individuals and that latency differences alone could not account for these differences, we hypothesized that either the peak and/or the duration of the activations would be enhanced in inhibited individuals. RESULTS behavioral data to determine if there were temperamental differences in face memory, we compared performance on immediate and delayed face memory. on the immediate memory task, average performance was at the 50th percentile for both the inhibited and uninhibited groups, t = . <dig> p = . <dig> delayed memory performance was similar for both the inhibited and uninhibited groups, t = -. <dig> p = . <dig> to validate that participants were actively engaged in the task and to assess possible group differences in memory for the faces shown during the task, we performed a post-scan recognition task using both examples of the familiar and novel faces from the task. both groups demonstrated similar accuracy for both the familiar faces and the novel faces . temporal dynamics to determine if the temperament groups differed in the timing of the amygdala's response to faces, we compared onset latency, duration, and peak of response to novel relative to familiar faces. for each analysis, we used a repeated measures analysis of variance with temperament group as the between-subjects factor and face type as the within-subjects factor. latency temperament group differences emerged in the temporal dynamics of amygdala activations. for the onset latency, there was a significant interaction of temperament group and face type in the left amygdala, f = <dig> , p = . <dig> and in the right amygdala, f = <dig> , p = . <dig> . there were no significant main effects. we followed the significant interaction findings with post-hoc analyses. in the right amygdala, the interaction reflected a significantly faster onset to novel compared to familiar faces in the inhibited group, f = <dig> , p = . <dig> but not the uninhibited group . in the left amygdala, the effect of face type did not reach our statistical threshold in either group, but there were trends toward a faster onset to novel faces in the inhibited group and a faster onset to familiar faces in the uninhibited group . duration the duration of the amygdala's response to all faces differed by temperament group with inhibited participants showing a longer duration of response to both familiar and novel faces . the main effect of temperament group was significant for both the left and right amygdala, f = <dig> , p = . <dig> and f = <dig> , p = . <dig> respectively. there were no other significant effects for either amygdala, indicating that duration reflects a general difference in temporal dynamics that is not specific to novel stimuli. peak peak amygdala response did not differ significantly across temperament groups, face types, or the interaction of temperament group × face type. magnitude magnitude represents the overall amygdala response as typically measured in fmri studies. to assess whether the inhibited participants showed a greater amygdala response to novel faces, we compared magnitude of amygdala response to novel compared to familiar faces between the two temperament groups. for magnitude of amygdala response, there was a main effect of temperament group in the right amygdala, f = <dig> , p = . <dig> with response to faces greater in the inhibited temperament group . in the left amygdala, the magnitude was also larger in the inhibited group, but the difference failed to reach significance . we did not observe a temperament group × face type interaction, as the inhibited group showed enhanced responses to both novel and familiar stimuli, rather than a selective increase in the magnitude of response to novel relative to familiar faces. whole-brain analysis to determine if other brain regions showed a response to the novel faces, we performed exploratory whole brain analyses testing for temperament differences of the novel > familiar contrast. the inhibited participants showed a greater bold response for the novel > familiar contrast in the right cerebellum . the cerebellar cluster included both crus i and lobule vi. there were no brain regions where bold response was greater for the uninhibited participants for the novel > familiar contrast. while overall activation to faces, across subjects, was seen in expected regions, such as fusiform face area, thalamus, and visual cortex, none of these differed significantly by temperament group. discussion the results of our study provide initial evidence for temperamental differences in the temporal dynamics, or timing, of the amygdala's response to faces. the amygdala of inhibited persons responded more quickly to novel relative to familiar faces and had both longer and greater magnitude of amygdala response to both novel and familiar faces. these results extend previous reports of temperament-based differences in magnitude of amygdala response <cit> by demonstrating temperament-related differences in the amygdala's latency to respond to novel faces. our observation of shorter response latency in inhibited temperament is consistent with a previous study showing amygdala latency differences in spider phobics viewing spider versus neutral pictures <cit> . both studies found the latency difference in the entire amygdala region of interest. group differences in the amygdala response were only detectable because latency differences were specifically modeled and examined, demonstrating the importance of measuring temporal dynamics. faster amygdala responses may reflect a bias for detecting novelty and potential threat <cit> . this bias could result from either a higher saliency evaluation , or through a more generally lowered threshold . in either case, the more rapid engagement of the amygdala processing may lead to faster triggering of limbic mediated or modulated processes, including heightened orienting responses and vigilance for potential threat. persons with inhibited temperament had longer amygdala responses to both novel and familiar faces suggesting a general difference in temporal dynamics that was not specific to novelty. this finding stands in contrast to modeling of spider phobic responses, in which larson et al. <cit> observed shorter duration responses. the shortened duration in that study may have been caused by a visual avoidance of the spider pictures by the spider phobics, whereas in this study, the pictures of neutral faces were unlikely to elicit a strong avoidance response, even for people with social anxiety. the longer duration in the present study suggests a prolonged engagement of the amygdala. given the ambiguous nature of novel social stimuli, a longer amygdala response could reflect a prolonged appraisal period. alternatively, the prolonged activity may also reflect an extended influence of other brain regions, such as the visual cortex, or less effective inhibition of the amygdala by prefrontal cortical regions involved in regulating limbic responses. future effective connectivity analysis might advance our understanding of temperamental differences in the relationships between visual cortex, prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala. inhibited participants had a greater magnitude of amygdala response to both familiar and novel faces suggesting a generalized response to faces. beaton and colleagues <cit> reported a similar finding in their study of amygdala responses to faces of strangers compared to friends in people classified as shy or bold . however, this general response to faces is not consistent with the selectively increased response to novel versus familiar faces initially reported by schwartz and colleagues <cit> . differences in either study design or samples may account for the discrepancy. first, schwartz used a block design whereas both beaton and we used an event-related design. the alternating novel-familiar block design used by schwartz and colleagues inherently provides paradigmatic familiarity: once a participant sees the first stimulus in a block, they know they will see that same stimuli repeatedly and for alternating blocks, they also know what the next block will be. in contrast, studies with random presentation of the conditions prevent participants from knowing what they will see next . this may increase uncertainty about, and therefore amygdala response to, even the familiar faces. also, because block designs provide greater statistical power to detect changes in bold signal, the failure to find the novelty effect may be a type ii error. second, schwartz selected adult participants based on behavioral observations made during childhood. beaton used a current self-report measure in adults, and we used both current and retrospective self-report in adults. the identification of inhibited temperament in childhood may have contributed to the greater amygdala response to novelty as the early assessments may more closely reflect the underlying biology, prior to the influence of environment. moreover, the childhood assessment in the schwartz et al. study was based on a direct assessment of behavioral responses to multiple types of novelty, which may further heighten the ability to observe differential biological responses to novelty in their sample. increased activation to novel faces in inhibited persons was evident in the right cerebellum. the cerebellum has traditionally been viewed as controlling motor function; however, evidence is accumulating for a broader preparatory function in multiple neural systems, including sensory, attention, and memory systems . temperamental differences in the novelty responses of the cerebellum may reflect heightened preparatory responses to sensory stimuli, particularly potentially salient visual stimuli such as novel human faces. several caveats are warranted in interpreting the findings from the present study. first, we used self-report measures to assess both childhood and current inhibited temperament. researchers in the field of inhibited temperament have traditionally relied on behavioral assessments of temperament during infancy or early childhood. early behavioral assessments may be ideal for identifying biological-based differences which are yet to be significantly impacted by environment. however, these longitudinal, prospective studies are not practical for most researchers. the self-report instruments used here were developed for consistency with the infant and toddler behavioral assessments, have good reliability and validity, and have been associated with expected outcomes like social anxiety <cit> . second, the sample size for the study was relatively small. however, amygdala responses have been consistently demonstrated with samples of this size, including the study by schwartz and colleagues <cit> , and were large enough to see differences in temporal dynamics and overall duration and magnitude. post-hoc power analysis suggest that a sample size twice as large may have detected additional main effects of temperament, but no other novelty effects. still, given the reduced statistical power afforded by small sample sizes, these results should be interpreted with appropriate caution. finally, there was a trend for ethnicity to differ between the two temperament groups. to ensure that ethnicity did not confound the temperament results presented, we performed post-hoc tests for ethnicity effects within the inhibited group and found no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS although fmri studies have increasingly explored potential neural correlates of personality, the timing of the brain's response has been almost completely ignored. findings from this study provide initial evidence for temperamental differences in the temporal dynamics of the amygdala's response to novel and familiar faces. extending our knowledge to individual differences in how the brain responds to stimuli may provide new avenues for identifying underlying mechanisms of temperamental risk for the development of anxiety and depressive disorders.",

    "prompt": "Give a brief textual summary of the input content. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND during the last decade, the bat p. discolor has been used increasingly for psychophysical and neurophysiological studies of echolocation <cit> . p. discolor is medium-sized and forages for fruit, nectar, pollen and insects in a neotropical forest habitat. its vocal emissions are brief , broadband multi-harmonic, downward frequency modulated echolocation pulses with a frequency range of about <dig> to <dig> khz. in contrast, the rich repertoire of communication calls used for species-specific social interaction covers the lower frequency range from <dig> to <dig> khz <cit> . the responses of cortical neurons to complex stimuli relevant for echolocation in p. discolor have been compared to the behavioral performance of the bat <cit> . therefore, it is important to gain knowledge of the detailed organization of the ac with respect to basic response properties. the auditory cortex of mammals is composed of distinct fields, which can be characterized by physiological and cytoarchitectural features and their specific thalamo-cortical connections . the functional organization of the ac in bats has been extensively studied physiologically in several species . among the best studied acs so far are those of the mustached bat p. parnellii and the horseshoe bat, rhinolophus rouxi, both belonging to the group of the so-called cf/fm bats whose echolocation pulses consist of a constant frequency and a frequency modulated component. as common to all mammals studied so far, their acs contain a tonotopically organized primary auditory field with the frequency gradient running from caudal to rostral. however, in both cf/fm bats frequencies of the cf component of the calls are largely overrepresented in ai while frequencies of the fm component are only weakly represented <cit> . the ai is surrounded by cortical regions with neurons that show facilitated responses to specific spectral and temporal combinations of the cf and fm parts of the different harmonics of the echolocation pulses. cf/fm bats are rather specialized echolocators in that they hunt almost exclusively insects on the wings, whereas other bat species display more varied feeding ecology and very commonly use short downward fm echolocation pulses often with several harmonic components. in these bats the functional specialization of the ac is often not so clearly apparent, but still cortical fields can be segregated based on neurophysiological criteria like best frequency representation and response threshold <cit> . in the phyllostomid fm bat carollia perspicillata for example, two dorsal fields containing mainly neurons with bfs in the high-frequency range have been reported in addition to the tonotopically organized fields ai and aaf <cit> . in these high-frequency fields some neurons exhibited pulse-echo delay sensitivity as in cf/fm bats <cit> , but without topographical organization. except for a short autoradiographic labeling study <cit> the topography of the ac of p. discolor has not been studied. in general, the ac of only one other phyllostomid fm bat, c. perspicillata, has been investigated, so far <cit> . therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate neuroanatomical and neurophysiological properties of the ac of p. discolor in order to delineate its subdivisions. RESULTS auditory responses in the cortex of phyllostomus discolor as shown in fig. 1a, units responding to acoustic stimuli are found at parieto-temporal portions of the neocortex of p. discolor. the distribution of neurophysiological recording sites defines the functional location of the bat's ac. external features roughly delineating the ac are the pseudocentral sulcus <cit> , which is located at the rostro-dorsal border and the fissura rhinalis, which is located at the ventral border. the auditory cortical area covers a rostro-caudal distance of about <dig> μm and has a dorso-ventral extension of about <dig> μm in the lateral view as shown in fig. 1a. to obtain a realistic estimate of the cortical surface containing auditory units, the locations of the recorded units were projected on an unrolled and flattened surface projection along the medio-lateral coordinate . in this projection, the lateral extension of the auditory responsive area is roughly <dig> μm. neuroanatomy in the area responsive to acoustic stimuli four major fields are recognized based on cyto- and myeloarchitectural features and zinc staining pattern, i.e. the anterior and posterior dorsal fields , an anterior ventral field and a posterior ventral field . the pvf maybe further subdivided into a dorsal and a ventral part and a border zone , due to minor modifications of the neuroarchitectural characteristics. the topographic position of these fields is depicted in fig. 1c. reliable borders of cortical fields are indicated by solid lines. dashed lines represent the more variable outlines of the ac itself and for pvf possible anatomical subdivisions that are not corroborated by neurophysiological data of the study. frontal sections in fig. <dig> give showcase characteristics at two rostro-caudal levels to get a general idea of field differences. total cortical thickness, relative thickness of the different layers, composition of cell types, cell density, content of myelinated fibers and zinc are considered as parameters for the distinction of the different fields. cut-outs of frontal sections stained for cells , myelinated fibers and for zinc from the centers of the different cortical fields are mounted in fig. <dig> for detailed comparison. total cortical thickness varies between <dig> μm and <dig> μm from dorso-rostral to ventro-caudal locations in the ac. despite the high density of granular elements in layer iii and iv of the dorsal fields, the cortical layers v and vi take more of the total thickness of the cortex. therefore, they are addressed as parietal cortical fields. the ventral fields are thought to belong to the temporal cortex, as layers iii and iv dominate layers v and vi in thickness although granular elements are sparse and the cell density is lower in layers iii/iv compared to the dorsal fields. dorsal and ventral fields also differ with respect to layer i, which is generally thinner in the dorsal than in the ventral fields. the myelinated horizontal fibers in the superficial part of layer i form a narrow dense band in the dorsal fields, but a broader one in the ventral fields, which is paralleled by a nearly zinc-free stripe in the ventral fields. the most characteristic features used for delimitation of cortical fields are described in detail as follows. adf has the greatest cortical width that seems to be caused by a doubled layer v: layer v of the non-auditory cortical area dorsal to the ac seems to continue beneath layer v of adf . in avf, the rostral beginning coincides with the most caudal part of the claustrocortex without a sharp border. the myelin content in avf is comparably low, whereas the stain for zinc is generally intense . even the paler staining band corresponding to layer iv is relatively dark. the posterior fields are more homogeneous. cortical width in pdf is smaller than in adf and characteristic differences to the neighboring pvf are obvious at higher magnification . in the zinc stain, layer iv is narrower and more heavily stained in pdf than in pvf, whereas layer v is thicker and of higher staining intensity. pvf has the most conspicuous wide and pale zinc staining band in layer iv, encompassing deep layer iii. layer v shows three subdivisions in the dorsal part , whereas in the ventral part only two subdivisions are recognizable. layer vb, the most intense staining part of layer v is strikingly darker in pvfv. in pvfbz a gradual change of the characteristic features from pvf toward the ventrally adjacent perirhinal cortex takes place, e.g. the layered organization fades as well in the cell stain as in the zinc stain, and so do the myelinated fibers. layer iv appears as a pale band with the lowest staining intensity in the zinc stain and the staining intensity of layer iv varies characteristically between the fields. it is faint in layer iv of pdf, comparably lighter in adf, relatively dark in avf and faintest in pvf. layer iv contains a high number of granular elements in the dorsal fields, whereas the neuronal somata in the ventral fields are larger and the cell density is lower. layer iv is heavily myelinated in all fields except in the sparsely myelinated avf. basic neuronal response properties because it was not always possible to discriminate the activity of a single neuron, the term 'unit' will be used in the following to describe the activity of one neuron to clusters of three neurons recorded at a distinct recording site. extracellular recordings were derived from a total of <dig> units from both hemispheres of ten bats. the number of units recorded in one bat ranged from <dig> to <dig> with an average of <dig> units per bat . thus, on average two units were recorded per penetration. recording depths of units derived from roughly orthogonal electrode penetrations were in the range of <dig> to <dig> μm from the cortical surface . the first row shows the number of electrode penetrations in the ac of each bat, the total number of recorded units in each of the ten experimental animals is shown in the second row. best frequency and threshold as shown in fig. 4a, bfs of units ranged from five to <dig> khz . seventy nine percent of the units had bfs above <dig> khz, i.e. in the range of the dominant harmonics of the echolocation pulse of p. discolor. the response threshold at bf was determined in <dig> units and varied between zero and <dig> db spl. the frequency distribution of thresholds reaches its maximum around <dig> db spl with roughly symmetric flanks to lower and higher thresholds . latency and response duration the first spike latency was measured in <dig> cortical units and ranged between five and <dig> ms with a bias toward short latencies . median latency of all units was <dig> ms . units often exhibited onset responses to pure tones frequently followed by a sustained response component that generally exhibited a considerable amount of variability. other response types e.g. on-off responses were not observed in the ac of p. discolor. the response duration to a <dig> ms pure tone was determined in <dig> units and ranged from three to <dig> ms . short phasic responses with durations below <dig> ms were found in <dig> % of units, medium response durations between <dig> and <dig> ms were found in <dig> % of units and <dig> % of units had response durations longer than <dig> ms . thus, in <dig> % of units the response duration exceeded the duration of the pure tone stimulus . frequency response areas q10db values covered a range between <dig> and <dig> . the distribution showed a peak around five , indicating that sharp frequency tuning is rare in cortical units of p. discolor. the regression line in fig. 4h shows that q10db values roughly increased with increasing bfs. q30db values covered the range between <dig> and <dig> . the difference between the medians of the q10db and q30db values suggests that in many units the sharpness of frequency tuning was only slightly decreasing with increasing stimulus level. in <dig> units, the fras could be classified into six different types . most units showed a v-shaped fra with equal share of monotonically and non-monotonically responses. sixteen percent of cortical units showed double- or multi-tuned fras two thirds of which displayed monotonic and one third non-monotonic response behavior . in <dig> % of multiple tuned units, threshold minima were roughly harmonically related. in six percent of units, the fras constituted closed areas in the frequency-intensity field with spike rates dropping to zero at all frequencies with increasing stimulus level . the remaining units featured complex-shaped fras . binaural response properties in <dig> units the binaural response properties were measured and units were classified following their contra versus ipsilateral response characteristics . ee responses were measured in <dig> % of units, <dig> % of units were inhibited by the ipsilateral ear and <dig> % of units showed no reaction to ipsilateral stimulation . four percent of units , could not be classified in one of the above classes and were thus named as \"other\". representation of neuronal response properties in cortical fields the local representation of selected response properties on the cortical surface was visualized using the voronoi tessellation method . the tessellation field around the recording site has its limits at halfway distance to the next surrounding recording sites and its color displays the respective response strength of the unit at the center. this forcibly entails large tessellation fields in areas in which recording density is lower or in border regions. as a consequence, there is no proper meaning in the area of single tessellation fields, but rather the clustering or systematic trends of tessellation fields within the ac are important information. response properties of cortical units were analyzed for the four major subfields. possible anatomical subdivisions of pvf were not corroborated by the neurophysiological data, and thus, pvf was analyzed as a whole. representation of best frequency and q10db the organization of bfs within the ac of p. discolor is shown in fig. 6a. units in the dorsal fields had a relatively restricted range of mainly high bfs, which covered frequencies in the range of the dominant harmonics of the echolocation pulse of this species. most units in the adf had bfs above <dig> khz, whereas units in the pdf had mainly bfs above <dig> khz. only at the most rostral positions of the adf units with low bfs were found. no tonotopic arrangement of bfs was found in the dorsal fields. in contrast, fields in the ventral part of the ac showed a tonotopic organization of bfs. the frequency gradient in avf developed along the rostro-lateral to caudo-medial axis with low bfs at rostro-lateral positions, whereas in pvf the bfs decreased from rostral to caudal cortical positions. thus, pvf and avf shared a common high-frequency border. the rough direction of bf gradients in the ventral fields is schematically shown in fig. 6b. as shown in fig. 6d, the median bf in pdf was significantly higher than the median bfs of the other cortical fields . the lowest median bf was found in pvf. q10db values of units were also not uniformly distributed on the cortical surface but showed a tendency to increase from anterior to posterior locations . in both anterior fields, units showed broader frequency tuning with significantly lower q10db values than found in units in the posterior fields . representation of threshold, latency and response duration the distribution of first spike latencies in the ac of p. discolor is shown in fig. 6g. as a general trend, short first spike latencies were preferentially represented in units in the two anterior fields, whereas in units in the posterior fields also long latencies were found. the median latency of pvf was significantly longer than the median latencies of adf , avf and pdf . the representation of response durations within the ac showed the same trend as the representation of first spike latencies: short durations were characteristic for units in the anterior fields, whereas in the posterior fields units with long response durations were found, too. the median response duration of units in adf and avf were significantly shorter than the median response duration of units in pvf but only slightly shorter than the median response duration of units in pdf . in addition, the median response duration in pdf was significantly shorter compared to pvf. representation of fra type and binaural response properties the representation of the different fra-types showed slight differences between anterior and posterior cortical fields . most units of anterior fields had monotonic v-shaped or monotonic double tuned fras , whereas non-monotonic v-shaped and non-monotonic double tuned fras were mainly found in posterior fields . the cortical representation of double tuned fras with harmonically related components did not show a specific clustering within certain subfields. discussion this study investigated the localization, neuroarchitecture and basic physiological response properties of the auditory cortex of the bat p. discolor. the large area of neocortex responsive to acoustic stimulation comprises four anatomically distinguishable fields: a ventral part of the ac with an anterior and a posterior subdivision and a dorsal part of the ac further divided into anterior and posterior subfields, adf and pdf. the anatomical parcellation of the ac was consistent with the differentiated distribution of basic acoustical response properties of units in the cortical subfields. location and extension of the ac of p. discolor as defined by neurophysiological and neuroarchitectural methods in this study roughly corroborated the findings from an earlier 2-dg study in the same species by esser <cit> . comparison with the auditory cortex of other bats the distribution of bfs in the ac of p. discolor showed an overrepresentation of frequencies in the spectral range of the bat's echolocation pulse . this overrepresentation might be due to the fact that the dorsal fields are mainly containing units with bfs in the high-frequency range. thus, a larger amount of cortical surface is devoted to units with high bfs as compared to units with low bfs. in addition, more units were recorded from the dorsal fields and this bias might also be reflected in the distribution of bfs. a similar overrepresentation of bfs in the spectral range of the echolocation pulses has been found in the ac of other microchiropteran bats e.g. e. fuscus <cit> , myotis lucifugus <cit> and c. perspicillata <cit> . in the cf/fm bats p. parnellii <cit> , r. rouxi <cit> and r. ferrumequinum <cit> the overrepresentation of a narrow call-specific spectral range of the cf-part is reflected throughout the ascending auditory pathway <cit> and is based on specializations already implemented on the cochlear level <cit> . in cf/fm bats, a large part of the ac is involved in processing of specific combinations of the different harmonics in the echolocation pulse and echo. in p. parnellii and slightly less distinctive in r. rouxi, several fields can be segregated by virtue of selective responses of neurons to different combinations of fm-parts or cf components of call and echo. neurons are tuned to delays between the components and are topographically ordered <cit> . such a complex representation of pulse and echo delay has generally not been found in fm-bats so far, although pulse-echo delay sensitive neurons exist in the ac of e.g. m. lucifugus <cit> and in the dorsal parts of the ac of the phyllostomid bat c. perspicillata <cit> , which is closely related to p. discolor. in the present study, only pure tones but no echolocation related stimuli were used for acoustic stimulation . consequently, no statements concerning the functional involvement of cortical subfields other than pure tone processing can be made, so far. besides that, the organization and parcellation of the ac of p. discolor is generally in accordance with that of c. perspicillata. the dorsal fields in the ac of carollia were similarly characterized by neurons with bfs in the high-frequency range, and the ventral part of the ac was also composed of two tonotopically organized subfields, which shared a common high-frequency border <cit> . in contrast, the ac of other non-phyllostomid fm bats like m. lucifugus and e. fuscus showed differentiation into subfields to a lesser degree <cit> . in both species tonotopically organized fields with frequency gradients running in opposite directions were found, but no fields with characteristics similar to the dorsal cortical fields in p. discolor were described. a high percentage of units in the ac of p. discolor had first spike latencies below <dig> ms. as other studies in fm-bats reported mean latencies measured at <dig> to <dig> db above threshold around <dig> to <dig> ms already on the level of the ic <cit> , this seems to be unusually short. however, short latencies in the ac of fm-bats were also reported <cit> . in addition, haplea et al. showed that on the level of the ic latencies in e. fuscus still could be as short as about three milliseconds <cit> . although most cortical neurons in r. rouxi had latencies in the range between <dig> to <dig> ms, short latencies below <dig> ms were found in a substantial <dig> % of neurons <cit> . the bias toward short latencies below <dig> ms in p. discolor might be explained by the fact that a large number of recordings in our study were derived from dorsal regions of the ac where short latencies are predominately represented. in contrast to findings in other mammals where the ai has been described to have the shortest latencies <cit> , the lowest median first spike latency in p. discolor was found in the adf, whereas in the pvf, which might be equivalent to the ai, the longest first spike latencies were found. our findings in p. discolor are supported by the fact that in the ac of r. rouxi shortest latencies were also found in the dorsal fields <cit> . in r. rouxi, ventral and dorsal cortical fields are not sequentially connected but rather receive connections from different parts of the auditory thalamus via different projection pathways <cit> . in p. discolor, a similar connection pattern could explain the shorter latencies in the dorsal fields compared to the ventral fields. however, this hypothesis needs to be proved by future tracer studies in this species. influence of anesthesia and multi unit recordings on response patterns a large proportion of units in the p. discolor ac showed onset-type responses. it is known that the response pattern of cortical neurons is influenced by anesthetics. for example, the use of barbiturates like pentobarbital that enhances gabaa-mediated inhibition biased the distribution of response types toward short onset responses in the rat auditory cortex <cit> . the drug midazolam used in our study, like other benzodiazepines, also enhances action of gaba on gabaa receptors. thus, the high abundance of phasic onset-type responses in our study could be a consequence of the use of midazolam. however, a high percentage of onset-type response patterns were also found in neurons in the ac of awake r. rouxi <cit> and awake mustached bats <cit> , indicating that even in the un-anesthetized bat phasic responses are common. this minimizes the potential effect of anesthetics on response types of cortical units in the present study. another point that could have influenced the response pattern is that recordings in our study were not always derived from single units . seshagiri and delgutte <cit> showed that adjacent neurons recorded simultaneously with tetrodes in the inferior colliculus of cats could differ significantly in their temporal discharge pattern although bfs and threshold were highly correlated. therefore, blurring of response pattern is possible in some cases in multi unit recordings, but markedly dependent on the number of contributing neurons with dissimilar response types. as multi unit recordings in this study were generally derived from only up to three neurons , and most units showed phasic responses the pooling of spikes in multi units should not have severely effected the response pattern in most cases. parcellation of the ac in p. discolor one way of defining different fields of ac is by comparing the afferent connections with the auditory thalamus. common to all mammals is a strong tonotopically organized projection from the ventral division of the medial geniculate body to ai <cit> . in contrast to this, non-tonotopically organized non-primary cortical areas receive major projections from the dorsal division of the mgb <cit> . cf/fm bats like horseshoe bats and p. parnellii <cit> follow this connectivity pattern. in both animals, ai contains a tonotopic map where frequencies of the cf-components of the calls are overrepresented while frequencies of the fm-components are largely absent <cit> . in r. rouxi, neurons specialized for the processing of acoustic parameters relevant for echolocation are mainly represented in dorsally located cortical areas that are targeted by projections from the mgbd <cit> . the view of a congeneric projection from mgbv to ai covering the entire frequency range has been challenged by recent findings in the gleaning bat antrozous pallidus. in this bat, the low frequency portion of a coherent frequency representation in the ac is innervated by the mgbv, whereas the high-frequency part received major projections from the supra-geniculate nucleus, a part of mgbd <cit> . neurons in the high-frequency range were moreover of a distinct binaural input type and preferred fm-sweeps, whereas neurons in the low frequency part were classified as ei and responded preferentially to noise. two functionally distinct pathways evidently exist in this bat species: first, a low frequency pathway serving for passive prey location and second, a high-frequency pathway serving for obstacle avoidance during active echolocation <cit> . the approach that part of ai may not receive input from the mgbv challenges one of the traditional definitions for ai via connectivity that, however, does not constitute the only valid criterion. the distribution of binaural response types in p. discolor resembles that in a. pallidus, whereas neuroarchitectonic and neurophysiological features argue for a cortical fields pattern of the ac in p. discolor similar to the arrangement in r. rouxi and other mammals. tracer experiments were not included in the present study in p. discolor, and consequently data on thalamo-cortical connections are not available. however, neuroarchitectonic features provide valuable tools for the definition of subdivisions in ac when combined with neurophysiological outcomes. undoubtedly, the combination of all three approaches would yield optimal possibilities to classify cortical subdivisions. the specific usefulness of different neurohistological stains to determine cortical fields will be discussed in the following: the staining for zinc proved to be specifically helpful, complementing staining for cells and myelinated fibers. the zinc stain reveals horizontal bands in the neocortex that show characteristic variation in width and staining intensity among cortical regions, sharply defining the borders between cortical areas and their subdivisions, and are generally coincident with the limits defined in the nissl stained sections. the banding patterns are stable among the species studied so far, allowing for an interspecies comparison . the pvf shows several features in the zinc stain characterizing primary sensory regions in the mammalian neocortex: conspicuous pale zinc staining of the outer portion of layer i, the differentiation of layer v in sublayers and, most characteristic, a wide, light band corresponding to layer iv encompassing the lower portion of layer iii. in pdf, most distinctive to the pvf is the zinc staining of layer iv, which is narrower and more heavily stained, whereas layer v is thicker and of higher staining intensity. zinc staining in avf is generally intense. these features of pdf and adf have been described to be characteristic for secondary sensory regions . furthermore, the structure of adf seems unique in that it could be an amalgam of auditory and neighboring non-auditory, probably somatosensory areas. mixed auditory-somatosensory fields neighboring the ac rostrally have been reported for several mammalian species . the accordance of response properties of cortical units in avf and pvf with the anatomical partitioning of ventral auditory fields in the cortex is a further strong support, that the pvf might correspond to ai in p. discolor. pvf is tonotopically organized with bfs increasing from caudal to rostral. the avf shows also a tonotopic organization but in contrast to the pvf, bfs increase from rostro-ventral to caudo-dorsal locations. this organization is in accordance to findings in other mammals where tonotopic gradients with roughly opposite directions have also been identified in the ai and the aaf . because of the common high-frequency border of the avf and pvf, high frequencies are represented all the way along the medial border of the pvf down to the most ventral border of this field . in addition, no clear tonotopic gradient can be seen in the pdf that could be a tonotopic continuation of the frequency representation in the ventrally located pvf. thus, it is unlikely that the pdf just represents the high-frequency portion of a contiguous frequency representation starting with low frequencies in the pvf as assumed for the ac of a. pallidus <cit> . it is more likely that the pdf represents a non-tonotopically organized field like the dorsal fields found in other bats before . however, also in c. perspicillata information about the thalamo-cortical connections is lacking. in addition to bf, the distribution of several response properties like duration and first spike latency showed significant differences between the pdf and the pvf. to further test the possibility that high-frequency units in the pdf and pvf belong to a contiguous frequency representation like in a. pallidus <cit> , we additionally tested the differences of latency and response duration only for the high-frequency units of both cortical fields. latency and response duration for high-frequency units alone were still significantly different between pdf and pvf. these findings further strengthen our parcellation of the ac based on the anatomical findings. CONCLUSIONS in this study, four subfields were identified in the ac of the bat p. discolor. these differed in their neuroanatomical attributes and in the response properties of their units to pure tone stimulation. the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological properties of the tonotopically organized pvf reflected common characteristics of ai in the mammalian ac . the avf located rostrally to the pvf showed a tonotopic bf gradient running roughly in opposite direction to the gradient of the pvf. thus, the avf of p. discolor might represent the aaf described in other mammals. the dorsal part of the ac of p. discolor was non-tonotopically organized with bfs mainly in the high-frequency range. as most energy of the echolocation pulse of this bat species is contained in the frequency range between <dig> to <dig> khz, the dorsal region of the ac of p. discolor seems to be particularly important for echolocation. with regard to the relative position of cortical fields and their basic properties of bf representation, the ac of p. discolor seems to follow the organizational pattern seen in other phyllostomid bats. to further compare the parcellation of the ac of p. discolor with those of other bats and mammals, the specific connectivity between subdivisions of the ac and different divisions of the auditory thalamus of p. discolor must be investigated in future studies.",

experimental design of genetic association studies based on the development of biological technology. many variants have been identified to be associated with the quantitative traits. for example, in studying genetic loci in association with various phenotypes, <dig> were reported to be associated with human height <cit> , <dig> were associated with age at menarche <cit> , <dig> were identified to be associated with body mass index <cit> , and the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs <dig> was associated with both diastolic and systolic blood pressure levels <cit> . a standard approach to conduct an association test in a quantitative trait genetic study is to fit a linear model based on the assumption that the original or transformed trait values follow a normal distribution. however, the normal assumption is often violated for many traits even though some transformations such as the log-transformation are carried out. for example, the number of tumors per subject in mouse follows a negative binomial distribution <cit> and the survival time of a person follows a truncated distribution <cit> . a good alternative to address this issue is to use the nonparametric tests. although there are various nonparametric tests in the literature, the most commonly used ones in genetic studies are the kruskal-wallis test <cit> and the jonckheere-tepstra test <cit> . originally, the kw was designed to detect the differences of the response variable in the medians of three groups and it was a nonparametric version of one-way analysis of variance based on ranking. the jt was also a rank-based test for an ordered alternative hypothesis which was particularly sensitive to the genetic mode of inheritance. recently, zhang and li <cit> defined the nonparametric risk and nonparametric odds and proposed a nonparametric trend test that has been shown to be more powerful than kw and jt under a given genetic model. these methods, however, would suffer from loss of power when the underlying genetic model is misspecified. in the present paper, we propose a two-phase robust procedure to test the genetic-phenotypic association. we first construct a test to classify the genetic model in a nonparametric way. we find that the test statistic tends to be positive when the genetic model is dominant, and negative when the model is recessive. then based on the chosen model, the association test is conducted. we derive the correlation coefficient of the test used for choosing the genetic model and that for doing association study and obtain the proper size for a given nominal significance level. extensive simulation studies are conducted to show the new approach to have empirical size less than the nominal level, and to compare this new approach with kw and max <dig> the maximum value of three npts. the results show that the proposed two-phase procedure is more robust than max <dig> and kw in the sense that its minimum power in a set of plausible models is the highest among the tests under consideration. finally, a real data analysis is used for further illustration. methods notations and genetic models consider a biallelic marker whose genotype is coded as <dig> , and <dig> corresponding to the count of a certain candidate risk allele or a minor allele. suppose that there are n subjects that are independently sampled from a source population in a quantitative trait genetic association study. let ,i= <dig> ,⋯,n be the observed sample, where yi is the trait value and gi denotes the genotype value of the ith subject, i= <dig> ,⋯,n. for brevity, let the first n <dig> subjects have genotype <dig> the second n <dig> subjects have genotype <dig> and the last n <dig> subjects possess genotype <dig> denote fij=pr,i,j= <dig> , <dig> where y <dig> y <dig> and y <dig> are the random variables that take values in three sets {y <dig> y <dig> ⋯,yn0}, {yn0+ <dig> yn0+ <dig> ⋯,yn0+n1} and {yn0+n1+ <dig> yn0+n1+ <dig> ⋯,yn}, respectively. the null hypothesis of no association is given by h0:f01=f02=1/ <dig> the alternative hypothesis is h1:f02≥f01≥1/ <dig> and f02>1/ <dig> a genetic model specifies the mode of inheritance. the three genetic models are: recessive model if f01=1/ <dig> and f12=f02>1/ <dig> additive model if f01=f12>1/ <dig> and f02>1/ <dig> and dominant model if f01=f02> <dig> and f12=1/ <dig> model selection denote Δ1=f01−1/ <dig> Δ2=f12−1/ <dig> we find that Δ1−Δ <dig> tends to be negative value under the recessive model and take positive under the dominant model. the signs of under the three genetic models are plotted in fig. <dig> where the line corresponding to the additive model is the straight line with a slope of <dig> at the point c, c=τ and τ denotes the transpose of a vector or a matrix, and the other two lines are

follow the standard normal distribution. two-phase procedure we propose a two-phase procedure for the quantitative trait association study by first determining the underlying genetic model in the first phase, followed by testing the association with the corresponding npt for the selected model in the second phase. in details, the two-phase procedure can be described by the following two steps: step <dig> determine the genetic model using z <dig> if z1<−ξ, the recessive model is used, else if z1>ξ, we use the dominant model, otherwise, the additive model is used. step <dig> we choose the association test statistic based on the chosen model in step <dig> and do the association study. size adjustment to adjust the size of the two-phase procedure for a given overall nominal significance level, we need to derive the joint distribution of z <dig> and zx, x∈{r,a,d}. from the additional file <dig> under the null hypothesis, τ asymptotically follows a bivariate normal distribution with mean and Λx, where Λx=1ρxρx <dig> x∈{r,a,d}. denote the cumulative distribution function of y <dig> y <dig> and y <dig> by f <dig> f <dig> and f <dig> respectively. then ρr, ρa and ρd are functions of f <dig> f <dig> f <dig> and p , which can be estimated empirically based on the observed data. the consistent estimates can be obtained under the situation that the means of the trait values in the groups with different genotypes being equal. the technical details of derivations for ρr, ρa and ρd under the null hypothesis are presented in the additional file <dig> suppose that the null hypothesis is rejected at the level of α∗ in the second phase. then, to control the overall level at a given α, we have α=ph0z1<−ξ,|zr|>z+ph0|z1|<ξ,|za|>z+ph0z1>ξ,|zd|>z, where z is the α quantile of the standard normal distribution. so, this relation can be written as α=∫ΩrΦ−z−ρru1/2+Φ−z+ρru1/2dΦ+∫ΩaΦ−z−ρau1/2+Φ−z+ρau1/2dΦ+∫ΩdΦ−z−ρdu1/2+Φ−z+ρdu1/2dΦ, where Ωr={u:u<−ξ}, Ωa={u:−ξ≤u≤ξ}, Ωd={u:u>ξ}, and Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. under the null hypothesis, we can numerically calculate the adjusted significant level for the association test statistic in the second phase. table <dig> shows the mean and standard error of α∗ with the nominal level of <dig> and <dig> based on <dig> and <dig> replicates, respectively. it indicates that α∗ is more likely to be smaller than α, and also α∗ is less vulnerable to the maf. for example, when maf= <dig> , the adjusted levels for the nominal α= <dig> and α= <dig> are <dig> and <dig> , and the corresponding standard error are <dig> and <dig> , respectively. RESULTS the performance of model selection procedure we conduct simulation studies to explore the performance of the model selection procedure. we generate data considering three genetic models. consider the linear model y=β0+gβ1+ε, where y denotes the phenotype value, g denotes the genotype value at a snp locus, and ε follows a truncated generalized extreme value distribution ) with the shape parameter <dig> the location parameter <dig> the scale parameter d, and the truncated point <dig> here we specify β0= <dig> , β1= <dig> , d= <dig> and the maf p∈{ <dig> , <dig> ,⋯, <dig> }. the total sample size is <dig> . <dig> replicates are conducted to compute the true selection rate under different scenarios. table <dig> shows the results for ξ=Φ−1= <dig> . the other results for ξ=Φ−1= <dig> , ξ=Φ−1= <dig> and Φ−1= <dig> are given in the additional file <dig> from table <dig> we can see that the tsr increases as maf increases. for example, if the recessive model is true, the tsr is <dig> % for maf of <dig> , while it is <dig> % for maf of <dig> . it makes sense since the expected number of subjects with genotype <dig> is increasing with the maf increasing. we also find that the tsr for additive model is satisfactory with the tsr being around <dig> %. for example, the tsr are <dig> % and <dig> % corresponding to maf of <dig> and <dig> , respectively. besides this, we also conduct simulations with covariates considering y=β0+xγ+gβ1+ε, where x is a covariate. the detailed results are available in the additional file <dig> with ξ=Φ − <dig> when the error follows tgev the sample size is n= <dig> and <dig> replicates are conducted the adjusted significant leveltable <dig> the adjusted level α ∗ for the nominal significant level α of <dig> and <dig> <dig> replicates are for the nominal level <dig> and <dig> replicates are for the level <dig> type i error rate we evaluate the empirical type i error rates of five tests: kw, zr, za, max <dig> and tpp. the simulation settings are similar as above. the sample size is <dig> . here we use ξ=Φ− <dig> β0= <dig> , and p∈{ <dig> , <dig> ,⋯, <dig> }. <dig> replicates are conducted for the nominal significant level of <dig> and <dig> replicates are conducted for the nominal significant level of <dig> . table <dig> shows the empirical type i errors of the five tests under the significant level of <dig> and <dig> . the results show that all of the five tests could control the type i error correctly with the empirical values being close to the nominal significance level. for example, when maf = <dig> , the empirical type i error rates of kw, zr, za, max <dig> and tpp test are <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , and <dig> , respectively, under the significant level of <dig> . when maf = <dig> and the nominal significant level is <dig> , the empirical type i error rates of kw, zr, za, max <dig> and tpp test are <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , and <dig> , respectively.r, z a, max <dig> and tpp when the error term follows tgev z r z a z r z a the sample size is <dig> . the left panel is for the significant level α= <dig> and the right panel is for the significant level α= <dig> power we compare the power among kw, zr, za, max <dig> and tpp under the similar settings to those described above. figures <dig> and <dig> report the power results for the nominal level of <dig> and <dig> , respectively, under the recessive, additive, and dominant models. in order to make the power comparable, when the nominal level is <dig> , we specify d= <dig> for β1= <dig> and d= <dig> for β1= <dig> , and when the nominal level is <dig> , we set d= <dig> and β1={ <dig> , <dig> }. the results indicate that, except the npt test under the true genetic model, the proposed tpp is always more powerful than kw and max <dig> this makes sense because that npt under a given model is the most powerful under that model, and the model selection procedure always gives a large probability of tsr. tpp is more powerful than kw, za, and max <dig> under the recessive model and in most scenarios under the dominant model. in some cases, there are <dig> % power increase. for example, when maf is <dig> , β1= <dig> , α= <dig> and the genetic model is recessive, the empirical powers of kw, za, max <dig> and tpp are <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , and <dig> , respectively. the performance of tpp is superior than the other three test kw, zr and max <dig> when the true model is additive or dominant. for example, when maf is <dig> and the genetic model is additive, β1= <dig> , α= <dig> , the empirical powers of kw, zr, max <dig> and tpp are <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , and <dig> , respectively. furthermore, using zr under the additive or dominant model can result in substantial loss of power. the tpp has higher robustness against the genetic model than other four tests. for example, when α= <dig> and β1= <dig> , the minimum value of power for tpp over maf from <dig> to <dig> is <dig> under the recessive, additive and dominant model, which is larger than those of kw , zr , za , and max <dig> . fig. <dig> the powers of kw, z r, z a, max <dig> and tpp with tgev error under three genetic models. the nominal level is <dig> .

application to gene dnah <dig> associated with anti-ccp measure we apply kw, za, max <dig> and tpp to identify the deleterious snps in the gene dnah <dig> <cit> for the association with the anti-ccp measure using the data from genetic workshop <dig> <cit> . the anti-ccp is present in the blood of the majority of patients with rheumatoid arthritis . the data includes <dig> cases and <dig> controls

coordinates <cit> following zhang and li <cit> and take the residuals as the new outcome. there are <dig> snps in gene dnah <dig> on chromosome <dig> we calculate the p-values of these snps using the kw, za, max <dig> and tpp approaches. there are six snps in gene dnah <dig> whose proportions of the missing genotype value are more than <dig> %, so we only show the p-value of the remaining <dig> snps. in the main text, we shows the results of the snps whose p-values are relatively small in table <dig> and the p-values of the other snps are summarized in table s <dig> in the additional file <dig> we find that the snp rs <dig> has the minimum p-value of <dig> ×10− <dig> using the tpp. the corresponding p-values using kw, za, and max <dig> are <dig> ×10− <dig> <dig> ×10− <dig> and <dig> ×10− <dig> respectively. burton et al. <cit> proposed to use the p-value threshold of 5×10− <dig> as the moderate association at the genome-wide level. because the p-values of kw, za and max are all larger than 5×10− <dig> there are no moderate genome-wide associations. however, for the tpp, we calculate the adjusted p-value threshold for 5×10− <dig> and it is <dig> ×10− <dig> this indicates that using the tpp can give the moderate-strong effect. z a α ∗ α ∗ is the adjusted p-value threshold for 5×10− <dig> the sixth column is the selected genetic model using the tpp in the first phase discussion and CONCLUSIONS with the developments of biological technology, more and more data on quantitative traits and genotypes are generated and deposited in public database such as the national center for biotechnology information database. it is urgent to develop new methods to excavate useful information to help understand the etiology of human complex diseases. a nonparametric two-phase procedure is proposed here to test the association between a di-allelic snp and a non-normal distributed quantitative trait when the genetic model is unknown. simulation results show that the proposed tpp is more robust than the existing methods. if there are covariates needed to be adjusted for, we can first regress on the covariates and use the residuals as the new outcome and then employ tpp to conduct the association study. the detailed simulation results are presented in additional file <dig> besides the truncated generalized extreme value distributional error term with the truncation

which occur only in teleosts amongst recent vertebrates, are segmental, serially homologous ossifications in the myosepta <cit> . these small bones make big troubles for edible and surimi product processing, as well as reduce the flesh quality because they are difficult to remove <cit> . the position in the myosepta distinguishes the ibs from ribs, which are found not in myosepta but in the muscle axialis <cit> . meanwhile, ribs develop from cartilage bone, which develop from a mesenchymal cell population derive from the ventral somite. unlike ribs, ibs develop directly from mesenchymal condensation. since 1960s, researchers gradually began to realize the significance of studying ibs in fish . however, these studies primarily focused on morphology, number and distribution of ibs in different fish species. as to the genetic resources of bone tissues for fish species, vieira et al. used the comparative transcriptome analysis to characterize regulation mechanism of the vertebrae and gill arch in the gilthead sea bream <cit> . our previous study has revealed the molecular properties of ibs through microrna transcriptome analysis <cit> . however, until now, the chemical composition of fish ibs and ribs has not been investigated. how many proteins of ibs and ribs may contain as well as which kind of differential expressed proteins existing between ibs and ribs remain unclear. proteomics is a large-scale, high-throughput, systematic study of a certain type of cell, tissue or body fluid composition of all proteins and an emerging discipline for proteins composition <cit> . in post-genomic era, proteomics had been widely applied to various fields. zhang et al. investigated the proteome of the oyster shell by mass spectrometry <cit> . fan et al. applied 2-de proteomics approach to investigate altered proteins in hepatopancreas of white shrimp during cold stress <cit> . as to fish species, lucitt et al. constructed zebrafish embryonic protein expression profiles by 2de lc-ms/ms method <cit> . kültz et al. studied biochemical differences of kidneys between marine and freshwater three spined sticklebacks by lc–ms/ms method <cit> . martyniuk et al. identified hepatic proteins associated with masculinization in female fathead minnow liver by using itraq technology <cit> . those studies involved in diverse biological processes of proteomics in fish species, including embryonic development, masculinization process, environmental adaption, and so on. multiple reaction monitoring was a powerful tool for targeted proteomics and was an emerging field of proteomics, which had high reproducibility across complex samples <cit> . currently, itraq discovery combined with subsequent mrm confirmation has been adopted to determine key protein biomarkers in diseases. muraoka et al. and kaur et al. identified key proteins biomarkers in disease by itraq proteomics combining with mrm assays, respectively <cit> . liu et al. used itraq proteomics combining with mrm assays to study the proteins associated with active immunization of subterranean termite <cit> . in the present study, the itraq proteomics together with mrm analysis could contribute to a better understanding of the development mechanism for ibs and ribs in teleosts. blunt snout bream , belonging to cyprinidae, is a typical aquaculture species with ibs in china. this fish could reach the maturation at 2-year old and the growth of individuals decrease a lot once it gets the maturation. in the present study, we want to construct the first proteomics map for fish bones including ibs and ribs, as well as to identify the differentially expressed proteins between ibs and ribs. moreover, we are also interested to find out which kinds of proteins play the important roles during the growing process of ibs and ribs. in order to obtain these objectives, itraq technology and mrm assays were used for proteomics analysis of ibs and ribs from 1- to 2-year old m. amblycephala. methods all animals and experiments were conducted in accordance with the “guidelines for experimental animals” of the ministry of science and technology . the study was approved by the institutional animal care and use ethics committee of huazhong agricultural university. all efforts were made to minimize suffering. all experimental procedures involving fish were approved by the institution animal care and use committee of the huazhong agricultural university. sample collection all experimental animals were collected from m. amblycephala selective population, which were bred in the tuanfeng fish breeding base of huazhong agricultural university. six 1-year old and six 2-year old m. amblycephala individuals were selected. all specimens were collected on the same day and under the same conditions. the fish were euthanized immediately in well-aerated water containing the 100 mg/l concentration of tricaine methanesulfonate before tissue collection. tissue samples including ibs and ribs were immediately collected, then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c. morphological identification hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the histological structures of ibs and ribs. considering the convenient for the sectioning of bones, the encircled tissues were also collected along with the ibs and ribs. these tissues were fixed in bouin’s liquid for 48 h, and embedded into paraffin blocks according to the routine procedures. subsequently, the specimens were sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. protein preparation and sds-page electrophoresis equal amount of tissues samples from each individual were mixed to grind into powder in liquid nitrogen and then the specific experimental method for protein extracted was referred from the method for protein preparation of liu’s reference <cit> . the concentration of the protein was measured with bradford method. specific experimental operation for bradford method can refer toyama’s operation <cit> . the proteins in the supernatant were kept at −80 °c for further analysis. ibs and ribs from three individuals were collected to extract protein for every stage and each stage possessed two biological replicates. so, we have eight protein samples, including 1-year old ib group and rib group , 2-year old ib group and rib group . sds-page is the most common analytical technique used to separate and characterize proteins, which can detect the integrity of the protein samples <cit> . in this study, sds-page was used to distinguish the generally different biochemical compositions of ibs and ribs as well as identify the integrity of ibs and ribs’ protein samples. aliquots containing 30 μg of each sample were separated on 10% resolving gels and sds-page analysis revealed clearly distinct band patterns for the ibs and ribs of m. amblycephala from the two developmental stages . the samples were suitable for subsequent analysis and then subjected to trypsin digestion and lc–ms/ms analysis. quantitative itraq analysis total protein was taken out from each sample solution to perform the quantitative itraq lc-ms/ms proteomic analysis. details of itraq labeling, strong cation exchange choematography fractionation and lc-esi-ms/ms analysis based on triple tof <dig> during itraq analysis are given in additional file 1: text s <dig> the obtained raw data files were converted into mgf files using proteome discoverer <dig> , <dig> msconverter and the mgf file were searched. proteins identification was performed by using mascot <dig> . <dig> against database containing <dig> sequences. for protein identification, a mass tolerance of 20 da was permitted for intact peptide masses and <dig> da for fragmented ions, with allowance for one missed cleavages in the trypsin digests. gln- > pyro-glu , oxidation , deamidated as the potential variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl , itraq8plex , itraq8plex as fixed modifications. the charge states of peptides were set to + <dig> and + <dig> specifically, an automatic decoy database search was performed in mascot by choosing the decoy checkbox in which a random sequence of database is generated and tested for raw spectra as well as the real database. to reduce the probability of false peptide identification, only peptides with significance scores at the 99% confidence interval by a mascot probability analysis greater than “identity” were counted as identified. each confident protein identification involves at least one unique peptide. functional annotations of the proteins were conducted using blast2go program against the non-redundant protein database and transcriptase data of intermuscular bones for 1-year old m. amblycephala which had been established by us previously . the kegg database and the cog database were used to classify and group these identified proteins. for protein quantization, it was required that a protein contains at least two unique peptides. the quantitative protein ratios were weighted and normalized by the median ratio in mascot. proteins with 2-fold change and p-value of statistical evaluation less than <dig> in the comparison groups of 1-ib-vs-1-rib , 2-ib-vs-2-rib , 1-ib-vs-2-ib and 1-rib-vs-2-rib were determined as differentially abundant proteins. mrm validation of differentially expressed proteins from itraq mrm assays were used to validate the differentially expressed proteins from itraq analysis <cit> . details of the mrm analysis were referred to the liu’s reference as well as described in additional file 1: text s <dig> RESULTS histological structures to understand the histological characteristic of ibs and ribs, tissues were collected from 1- to 2-year old individuals of m. amblycephala. after stained by hematoxylin-eosin , their microstructures were observed and presented in fig. <dig> the three typical types of cells for bone formation, including osteoclasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes, were found in the histological structures of ibs and ribs. however, one bone cavity containing osteoclasts was identified in ribs from 1- to 2-year old individuals, but not in ibs.fig. <dig> he staining results for ibs and ribs of m. amblycephala, a-ribs of fish at 1-year old; b-ibs of fish at 1-year old; c-ribs of fish at 2-year old; d-ibs of fish at 2-year old. a showed osteoblast; b showed osteoclast; c showed osteocyte proteome of ibs and ribs in the present study, to improve the reliability of data, two biological replicates were included in the itraq experiment for ibs and ribs at 1- and 2-year old m. amblycephala. after trypsinization and labeling with eight isobaric tags, the analytical separation and identification of the eight samples were performed. totally <dig> spectrums were generated, with <dig> peptides and <dig> proteins were identified . in all identified proteins, <dig> proteins were composed of only a single unique peptide and

annotated with kegg pathway and <dig> pathways were identified . a large number of proteins were found to be involved in metabolic pathways, dilated cardiomyopathy , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , focal adhesion, regulation of actin cytoskeleton as well as ecm-receptor interaction. there were <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> proteins identified in the mapk signaling, calcium signaling, tgf-β signaling, wnt signaling as well as osteoclast differentiation pathways, respectively . in all identified proteins, proteins associated with specific bone cell types including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes were identified, such as β-catenin and col2a1a protein associated with chondrocytes, osteocalcin and annexin a <dig> related with osteoblasts, matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> and vitronectin b precursor correlated with osteoblasts, osteoglycin and parvalbumin- <dig> associated with osteocytes. moreover, proteins associated with calcium or

cog function classifications. it was found that the proteins for d and e function classifications were just presented in 1-ib-vs-1-rib, not in 2-ib-vs-2-rib; whereas the proteins for f function classification were just presented in 2-ib-vs-2-rib, not in 1-ib-vs-1-rib . in both comparison groups, the proteins for o functions classification accounted the largest proportion.fig. <dig>

hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathway were maximum. noticeably, it was discovered that ras homolog gene family, member ac and thrombospondin- <dig> belonging to tgf-β signaling pathway were found in 2-ib-vs-2-rib, and thrombospondin- <dig> as well as thrombospondin- <dig> belonging to tgf-β signaling pathway were found in 1-ib-vs-1-rib. among the differentially expressed proteins, the two comparison groups shared <dig> proteins, among which only one protein was up-regulated and the rest of proteins were down-regulated . among these proteins, annexin a2a and osteocalcin being associated with osteoblast, parvalbumin isoform 1c being associated with osteocyte, were all down-regulation proteins. the proteins collagen α <dig> chain precursor, collagen α <dig> chain-like, matrilin <dig> precursor biglycan and biglycan precursor associated with ecm were identified to be down-regulated. there were <dig> and <dig> proteins were unique differentially expressed in 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 2-ib-vs-2-rib groups, respectively . for specific differentially expressed proteins in 1-ib-vs-1-rib group, proteins associated with transport, metabolism of amino acid and nucleoside diphosphatase were dominant. nine identified proteins were up-regulated including nidogen- <dig> tenascin-like, cartilage intermediate layer protein <dig> precursor, actin related protein 2/ <dig> complex, et al. parvalbumin isoform 1d, parvalbumin <dig> and calcium-binding protein precursor associated with binding ca2+ were found to be down-regulated. the down-regulated proteins of connective tissue growth factor precursor and insulin-like growth factor <dig> mrna-binding protein <dig> were also identified. for specific differentially expressed proteins in 2-ib-vs-2-rib, a total of <dig> up-regulated proteins and <dig> down-regulated proteins were identified. the mean ratio of myosin heavy chain fast skeletal type <dig> and troponin t3a was <dig> and <dig> . aggrecan core protein-like, matrilin-

osteoclast formation, had significantly higher expression in ribs compared to ibs . functional proteins during the growth of ibs and ribs a total of <dig> and <dig> differentially expressed proteins were identified by itraq proteomics in 1-ib-vs-2-ib and 1-rib-vs-2-rib comparison groups , with <dig> up-regulated and <dig> down-regulated, <dig> up-regulated and <dig> down-regulated, respectively . a total of <dig> and <dig> proteins were annotated in 1-ib-vs-2-ib and 1-rib-vs-2-rib by cog function classifications, respectively. there were just five classification functions in cog annotation identified for 1-ib-vs-2-ib differentially expressed proteins , including e , f , g , o and z , with the most number of proteins in z function. some classification functions was just identified for 1-rib-vs-2-rib group and the number of proteins for g and o function classifications in 1-rib-vs-2-rib group was more than that in 1-ib-vs-2-ib group.fig. <dig> comparison of proteins identified in

2-ib-vs-2-rib among the differentially expressed proteins, the two comparison groups shared <dig> proteins, among which nine proteins were up-regulated and two proteins were down-regulated . parvalbumin <dig> and parvalbumin <dig> associated with calcium were found to be up-regulated. there were <dig> specific differentially expressed proteins in 1-ib-vs-2-ib group , among which titin, fras <dig> related extracellular matrix <dig> precursor, tnc protein as well as tenascin-like correlated with skeletal proteins were identified. some proteins associated with myosin and some proteins played a role in metabolism of amino acid permeases and energy were identified. forty specific differentially expressed proteins were identified in 1-rib-vs-2-rib group . the value of ratio for actin-related protein <dig> and myosin light chain was <dig> and <dig> , respectively. collagen α <dig> chain-like was also identified and its mean ratio was <dig> . moreover, parvalbumin isoform 1d, parvalbumin isoform 4a and insulin-like growth factor <dig> mrna-binding protein <dig> were identified in 1-rib-vs-2-rib group. some proteins correlated with ca2+ metabolism and skeletal development were also identified. among the identified differential expressed proteins in the two comparison groups, there were many proteins associated with calcium or calcium-related, bone formation and growth . in order to better understand how these proteins made an effect on bone development, the proteins annotated with cog function and associated with bone formation were selected to explain the possible mechanism for bone formation. ca2+ may induce cell proliferation and growth by ca2+ combining with calmodulin and concentration of ca2+ also made an effect on cell proliferation and growth. some proteins, such as parvalbumin- <dig> tnc protein, myosin light chain, affect concentration of ca2+ and combining of ca2+ with cam. under the influence of protein-factor, cells can differentiate osteoblasts that can accelerate bone formation. the different expression levels of related proteins were indicated in fig. <dig> which could contribute to a better understanding of the basic information about which kind of proteins may play a more important role in the growth development of ibs and ribs.fig. <dig> distribution of the differentially expressed proteins in 1-ib-vs-2-ib and

protein, tenascin-like etc.) had most abundant expression in ribs tissue at one- <dig> old and four proteins were relatively more abundant in ibs at 1-year old compared with other three tissues. most of the proteins in calcium, mapk and gnrh pathways exhibited high expression in rib tissues. all four pathway proteins exhibited lower expression in ibs at 2-year old excepted filamin-c.fig. <dig>

amblycephala mrm validation for differential expressed proteins mrm analysis was a powerful tool that was used to validate targeted proteins. in the present study, mrm analysis succeeded in validating <dig> and <dig> proteins in comparison group of 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 1-ib-vs-2-ib, respectively . the transition information of two comparison groups of target proteins was showed in additional file 3:

itraq data were consistent with the results from mrm analysis. among them, the three significantly up-regulated proteins and three significantly down-regulated proteins ; ictacalcin) from itraq data were also showed significantly up-regulated and down-regulated in mrm analysis . in comparison group of 1-ib-vs-2-ib, the <dig> up-regulated proteins and two down-regulated proteins from itraq data have coincident expression with these from mrm analysis. among them, the three significantly up-regulated proteins and one significantly down-regulated protein from itraq data were also significantly up-regulated and down-regulated in mrm analysis. discussion the formation of bone includes complex multicellular activities involving various types of cells, with mainly cells being osteoclasts and osteoblasts <cit> . osteoblasts are related to structural bone and work in teams to build new bone <cit> . osteoclasts are the cells that degrade bone to initiate normal bone remodeling as well as conduct the function of bone resorption <cit> . when osteoblasts become trapped in the matrix that they secrete, they become osteocytes. during the bone growth, bone cavity will be enlarged by osteoclasts through bone resorption process. moreover, ikeda et al. reported that osteoclasts activity was regulated with osteoblasts in certain extent <cit> . factors secreted from osteoclasts, such as ephrinb <dig> complement component 3a, collagen triple helix repeat containing <dig> played a role in combining with osteoblasts receptor and osteoblasts differentiation, further affected bone mass and bone formation. in the present study, after he staining for the ibs and the ribs, osteocyte is the most found cell in tissues, which is in accordance with human bone <cit> . the osteoclasts and osteoblasts were both observed in histostructures of ibs and ribs, while bone cavity including osteoclasts was specially identified in ribs. these results indicated that there is less bone remodeling and bone resorption process in fish ibs compared to ribs, which maybe the reason that ibs cannot grow as big as ribs. in this study, the first proteomics data were constructed for fish ibs and ribs in m. amblycephala and a total of <dig> proteins were identified. there was a broad range in the biological functions represented by these proteins, with most represented by proteins included cellular process, metabolic process, single-organism process, biological regulation, developmental process, muleticellular organismal process. there has been great success in characterizing the proteome of fish tissues and the present study contributes to this growing body of literature. lucitt et al. identified an impressive <dig> proteins in zebrafish embryonic development stages at <dig> hpf and <dig> hpf, which revealed representation of protein classes relevant for cell function at both developmental stages, including proteins related to structure, transcription/translation, cell cycle, nucleotide metabolism, ion transport, carbohydrate, energy, and lipid metabolism <cit> . de souza et al. identified <dig> proteins in zebrafish gill that represented acid–base regulation, stress, ion balance, and metabolism <cit> . in the brain of zebrafish, singh et al. identified more than <dig> proteins representing hormones and hormone receptors <cit> . in the female fathead minnows liver, martyniuk et al. reported that 65% of the proteins had a biological role in metabolism and 42% had catalytic activity, which indicated that the female fathead minnows liver proteome is representative of the function of the liver in that it is the major tissue for detoxification and metabolism <cit> . in this study, there were <dig> % proteins had a cellular role and metabolic process in biological process, <dig> % proteins played a role in binding and catalytic activity in molecular function, and <dig> % proteins made an effect on cell and membrane in cellular component in identified proteins of ibs and ribs, respectively, which suggested that proteins identified by this study may mainly made an effect on bone formation. salmon et al. reported that <dig> proteins were identified in human alveolar bone by lc-ms/ms, and most proteins involved in cellular process, biological regulation, and metabolic process <cit> . therefore, proteins function of ibs and ribs were similar with human alveolar bone in terms of go annotation. the identified proteins for ibs and ribs of m. amblycephala were categorized into <dig> pathways, which were most represented by these proteins in metabolic, dcm, hcm pathways, focal adhesion, regulation of actin cytoskeleton as well as ecm-receptor interaction. three pathways for focal adhesion, regulation of actin cytoskeleton as well as ecm-receptor interaction had certain correlation in bone development. focal adhesion mainly affected cell proliferation. actin is one of the important cytoskeleton proteins and made an effected on cell moving. ecm is comprised of basic structural proteins, collagens, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins <cit> . ecm associated skeletal tissue of terrestrial vertebrates had been identified in vertebrae and gill arches of s. auratus <cit> . in the present study, the different types of collagens were identified, such as collagen type ii, collagen α <dig> chain, collagen α <dig> chain precursor and so on. proteins associated with tgf-β signaling pathway, wnt signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway were represented in ibs and ribs. both of tgf-β signaling pathway and wnt signaling pathway played an important role in the growth and differentiation of osteoblast, which was a part of skeletal tissue and involved in bone formation and differentiation <cit> . proteins of calcium signaling pathway associated with ca2+ or calcium-related including s <dig> calcium binding protein v <dig> hemicentin- <dig> calmodulin were identified. it had been reported that ca2+ could be involved in many intracellular processes, including bone homeostasis, and calcium signaling is regulated by specific calcium-binding proteins <cit> . meantime, concentration of ca2+ could urge cell to occur stimulus response, and ca2+ could directly act on osteoblast and affect bone formation . so many bone related proteins identified in this study justifies the enrichment of the proteomics for fish bones. differentially expressed proteins of 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 2-ib-vs-2-rib were analyzed to identify the differentially expressed proteins between ibs and ribs. osteocalcin and annexins a2a protein related with osteoblasts were identified as down-regulated proteins in both 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 2-ib-vs-2-rib groups, which mean they had higher expression in both 1- and 2-year old ribs compared with that of ibs. it had been reported that osteocalcin could induce bone regeneration and have distinct roles in the dentin mineralization process <cit> , so it may play a critical role in the development and growth of ribs. due to localization of annexins in areas of cartilage and bone mineralization, annexins made an important role in mineralization process. kirsch reported that annexins a <dig> a <dig> and a <dig> played a role in physiological mineralization of skeletal tissues <cit> . annexins a2a may affect bone mineralization and make more effect on ribs than ibs. moreover, biglycan, matrilin <dig> precursor, collagen , collagen α2) were found as differentially expressed proteins in two comparison groups, and those proteins were a part of ecm pathway which was associated with bone mineralization. above proteins associated with ecm, all was down-regulated proteins and played an important role in ribs growth compared with ibs development. nidogen- <dig> protein was just identified as differentially expressed proteins in 1-ib-vs-1-rib group with up-regulation level, not in 2-ib-vs-2-rib group. nidogen- <dig> was ubiquitous basement membrane proteins with a similar distribution in various organs during development, which could combine with cell membrane receptor and further promote bone formation <cit> . the up-regulation of nidogen- <dig> proteins in 1-ib-vs-1-rib group indicated it may play a critical role in ibs development compared with ribs. it was reported that vitronectin was characteristic markers for activated osteoclasts in mammals <cit> . mellis et al. reported that matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> could degrade the organic bone matrix <cit> . the resorption of mineralized bone matrix by osteoclasts concurs with deposition of new bone by osteoblasts. our results showed two related proteins were up-regulated in ribs compared with ibs, which was in accordance with the results from histological structures of ribs and ibs as there was no osteoclasts identified in ib internal tissues. the differentially expressed proteins in 1-ib-vs-2-ib and1-rib-vs-2-rib groups were analyzed to identify the proteins for the growth development of ibs and ribs, respectively. parvalbumin- <dig> and parvalbumin- <dig> associated with osteocyte were found being differentially expressed in both 1-ib-vs-2-ib and 1-rib-vs-2-rib groups. these two proteins had been reported to play a role in calcium signaling, through being correlated with calcium-binding protein and affecting relationship of troponin c combining with ca2+ <cit> . therefore, the up-regulation of parvalbumin- <dig> and parvalbumin- <dig> in both groups indicated their important roles in the development of ibs and ribs. tenascin-like, tnc, titin and fras <dig> related extracellular matrix <dig> precursor were identified as specific differentially expressed proteins in 1-ib-vs-2-ib. tenascin c is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein synthesized by osteoblasts during bone growth and morphogenesis, which was reported to affect mineralization of osteoblast-like cells by matrix vesicles . powers et al. study had proved that titin protein made an effect on skeletal muscle sarcomeres <cit> . according to our results, the up-regulation and down-regulation proteins may be the key proteins in regulating the ibs’ development. collagen α <dig> chain-like and myosin light chain were identified as specific differentially expressed proteins for 1-rib-vs-2-rib. collagen is the main composition of fish bone and connective tissue and involved in cell differentiation and multiplication <cit> . there are about <dig> different types of collagen having been identified in mammals, while just types i, ii, v and xi had been reported in fish species <cit> . myosin light chain protein is correlated with ca2+ binding protein and could affect bone formation. lai et al. reported that myosin light chain affected contractility of skeletal muscle in female mice <cit> . in this study, collagen α <dig> chain-like and myosin light chain both were up-regulated protein and they may play important roles in regulating ribs growth and development. demambro et al. reported that insulin-like growth factor-binding protein- <dig> is required for osteoclast differentiation and was related with the skeleton in mammals <cit> . the up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor <dig> mrna-binding protein <dig> identified in 1-rib-vs-2-rib may be similar with role of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein- <dig> and could regulate bone growth. these results suggest that there are different key proteins involved in development mechanisms of ibs and ribs. in addition, we screened out four pathways proteins related to bone development and cluster analysis indicated their different expression levels in ibs and ribs. calcium act as important second messengers for many intracellular processes including bone homeostasis <cit> . extracellular matrix , such as collagen, fibronectin, involved in bone mineralization and is critically important for cell growth, survival, differentiation and morphogenesis <cit> . mapk pathway is crucial for osteoclasts formation and differentiation and made an effect on bone mass <cit> . gnrh can stimulate the expression of annexin a <dig> <cit> , which had been reported to express in vertebrae of s. auratus and involved in bone mineralization <cit> . in the present study, different expression levels of the proteins from these four pathways indicated their possible important functions in the development of ibs and ribs. in two comparison groups, mrm analysis was successfully used to validate differentially expressed proteins in each group. among the validated proteins, collagens, fibronectin and osteomodulin are component of extracellular matrix and form tissue structure <cit> . ohara et al. reported that fish collagen can promote the synthesis of proteoglycans in guinea pig tibial epiphysis <cit> , and therefore it may affect the treatment of osteoarthritis. fibronectin and osteomodulin both were associated with collagen fibrils to contribute tissue strength <cit> . tanaka et al. found that osteoglycin could affect osteoblasts type and made an effect on expression of runx <dig> and osterix <cit> . in the present study, collagen, fibronectin precursor and osteomodulin as well as osteoglycin precursor from itraq data were analyzed by mrm in the two comparison groups. in 1-ib-vs-1-rib, the up-regulation of osteoglycin precursor and osteomodulin protein may play a more important role in ibs than ribs growth. collagen α <dig> and collagen α <dig> chain and collagen α <dig> chain were down-regulated proteins, suggesting that these three proteins may make a more effect on development of ribs than that of ibs. in 1-ib-vs-2-ib, the up-regulation of osteoglycin precursor, osteomodulin, collagen α <dig> and collagen α <dig> chain validated by mrm may be key proteins in ibs growth. in addition, laminin and tnc protein from itraq date that were associated with ca2+ were further validated by mrm, and these two proteins were up-regulated in two comparison groups may affect cell differentiation and further make an effect on bone formation. quantitative proteome is a powerful technology for large scare of differential proteins between different samples. among the different methodologies, stable isotopes labeling by amino acids in cell culture <cit> , isotope-code affinity tags <cit> as well as itraq used in the present study are commonly employed. although itraq analysis allows identification of more proteins than previous 2-de proteomics and more reliable quantification of the proteins, a large number of proteins can also not be detected by mass spectrometry. therefore, the proportionally large number of proteins classified in this study is not necessarily an accurate representation of the protein composition related to fish ib and rib. moreover, the performance of a concomitant proteomic and gene expression by throughput sequencing analyses would be expected to offer more reliable results. CONCLUSIONS in conclusion, this study utilized itraq methodology to construct the first proteomics map for fish bones including ibs and ribs, which increase knowledge about the proteins functioned in fish tissues. the identified <dig> proteins represent the most comprehensive fish bone proteomes to date. moreover, a total of <dig> and <dig> differentially expressed proteins were identified in comparison groups of 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 2-ib-vs-2-rib, as well as <dig> and <dig> differentially expressed proteins were identified in comparison groups of 1-ib-vs-2-ib and 1-rib-vs-2-rib. some proteins were identified to have more important functions for the development of ibs or ribs, such as myosin-7-like, tnc protein, tenascin-like, fras <dig> related extracellular matrix <dig> precursor as well as myosin heavy chain fast skeletal type <dig> for ibs, and actin-related protein <dig> collagen α <dig> chain-like as well as parvalbumin isoform 1d for ribs. the obtained protein data from present study will contribute to a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ibs and ribs development and the roles of proteins playing in regulating diverse biological processes in fish. additional files additional file 1: text s <dig> detailed experimental protocols for itraq analysis and mrm validation. additional file 2: figure s <dig> separation of ibs and ribs of m. amblycephala from <dig> to <dig> year old by sds-page. figure s <dig> the basic information statistics of proteome in this study. figure s <dig> the repeatability analysis of data obtained from itraq in different comparison groups based on cv analysis. figure s <dig> functional classification of identified proteins. additional file 3: table s <dig> functional annotation information for the <dig> identified proteins in ibs and ribs of m. amblycephala. table s <dig> proteins information annotated with go functions in ibs and ribs of m. amblycephala. table s <dig> kegg pathway analysis of identified proteins in ibs and ribs of m. amblycephala. table s <dig> detailed information for five pathways proteins of m. amblycephala. table s <dig> detailed information for proteins associated with bone cell of m. amblycephala. table s <dig> differential expressed proteins information in 1-ib-vs-1-rib and 2-ib-vs-2-rib. table s <dig> differential expressed proteins information in 1-ib-vs-1-ib and 1-rib-vs-1-rib. table s <dig> the transition information of two comparison group of target proteins. this work was financially supported by national natural science foundation of china , modern agriculture industry technology system construction projects of china titled as-staple freshwater fishes industry technology system , fundamental research funds for the central universities and wuhan youth science and technology plan . availability of data and materials all the data mentioned in the text are available in additional files. authors’ contributions zxg conceived and designed the experiments. chn and smw performed the experiments. chn, smw, tto, ttr and wmw contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools. zxg and chn analyzed the data and wrote the paper. cdh and wmw critically revised the manuscript. all authors read and approved the final version of the manuscript. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. consent for publication not applicable. ethics approval and consent to participate not applicable.",

RESULTS creation and selection of somatic embryo lines expressing transgenes agrobacterium inoculated embryos that remained alive during seven weeks of selection on kanamycin-containing media were tested further to confirm transformation. their transgenic nature was confirmed using gus assay and pcr. some j <dig> and rr <dig> co-transformed lines were positive for both nptii and pv <dig> the 1: <dig> cg:pv <dig> ratio produced a higher co-transformation efficiency than the 1: <dig> ratio. when only one bacterial strain was used for transformation, 72% of the embryos were positive for the pv <dig> gene and 92% were positive for the pv <dig> gene . j <dig> and rr <dig> transgenic lines and their genotypes determined by pcr are listed in table <dig> 1co-transformed percentage. 2the only transgenic line that survived was positive for both pv <dig> and nptii. 3single-vector transformed percentage. these samples only tested with pv <dig> primers. 4single-vector transformed percentage. these samples only tested with pv <dig> primers. 1one vector used for transformation. transgenic plant challenge with root lesion nematodes a rapid screening method was used to test for nematode resistance in both co-transformed and single-vector transformed transgenic lines. the nematode population supported by each transgenic line was compared to untransformed and transgenic controls. results of these trials are shown in the figures below . the two controls and line 66-1- <dig> were not significantly different in number of nematodes per root. transgenic line 68-3- <dig> supported up to 79% fewer nematodes per root following in vitro co-culture than untransformed controls. invitro grown roots of this line showed no visible damage due to nematode feeding after two months . lines 33-3- <dig> and 73-2- <dig> supported ~32% and ~36% fewer nematodes than the control nematode population, respectively. the least effective line, 66-1- <dig> still had ~10% fewer nematodes than the control nematode population . roots tips of line <dig> showed damage from nematode feeding and had less growth . rr <dig> transgenic lines had 79-84% fewer nematodes per root than the untransformed rr <dig> control . out of the five single-vector transformed lines tested, three lines controlled the nematode population completely . two other lines had ~64% and ~91% fewer nematodes relative to the untransformed control and no visible damage was observed in these roots while untransformed roots had damaged, undeveloped, and blackened roots . these results show that independent of the rolabc genes inserted into the co-transformed lines, the pv <dig> gene effectively controlled nematodes up to 79% in co-transformed lines and 100% in single-vector transformed lines. rolabc genes were introduced into the embryos by the resident t-dna in the a. rhizogenes ri-plasmid used as a vector for plant transformation. in the single-vector transformed lines, there were no rolabc genes inserted with the plasmid as a. tumefaciens does not carry them. crown gall challenge bioassay oncogene silencing was screened phenotypically following in vitro application of a. tumefaciens to sixteen microshoots generated from transformed line 33-3- <dig> or untransformed controls. the amount of undifferentiated callus forming on these tissues after inoculation with virulent a. tumefaciens strain 20w-5a was assayed five weeks post-inoculation . untransformed controls formed galls on <dig> of <dig> microshoots inoculated whereas no galls were formed on shoots of the transformed line <dig> control lines developed green callus at inoculation sites after five weeks. to confirm that this callus was crown gall tissue, small pieces were cultured further on hormone-free dkw medium. while most walnut tissues will not proliferate on this medium, crown gall tissue is capable of rapid hormone-independent growth. callus excised from controls displayed vigorous hormone-independent expansion while callus excised from line <dig> displayed only minimal growth . these results indicate crown gall initiation and proliferation is suppressed in transgenic line <dig> plant genotype and morphological changes co-transformation resulted in <dig> stable transgenic lines stacked with gus, nptii, pv <dig> iaam and ipt, and rolabc in walnut rootstock backgrounds j <dig> and rr <dig> the plants transformed with only pv <dig> and pv <dig> genes did not obtain rol genes but gus, nptii, pv <dig> or pv <dig> in rootstock backgrounds j <dig> . to see whether co-transformation changed the phenotype of transformants, the morphology of in vitro-grown microshoots of transgenic lines was compared to untransformed microshoots. shoot height, internode length, leaf size, and leaf appearance were assessed. major morphological differences were observed in shoots generated using the a. rhizogenes vector, including stunted growth, shorter internode length, and dark green, small, wrinkled leaves. this was especially apparent in line 33-3- <dig> . similarly, root growth patterns and root length of transgenic and untransformed in vitro-grown plantlets were compared. all co-transformed roots had 2– <dig> times greater root diameters than untransformed lines. shoots and roots obtained from single-vector transformation were similar in phenotype to untransformed plants . discussion “gene stacking” was used to generate transgenic walnut lines resistant to both nematodes and crown gall infection. crown gall resistance has been achieved previously in walnut using the self-complementary pde <dig> expression cassette and somatic embryos as explants <cit> . we used the same vector in co-transformations to produce transgenic line 33-3- <dig> which exhibited both complete suppression of crown gall and 32% fewer nematodes than untransformed control. co-transformations were designed to suppress expression of both the oncogenes iaam and ipt and the p. vulnus gene pv <dig> through rna interference. stacking crown gall rnai genes in combination with a nematode rnai gene proved a promising way to obtain resistance to both pathogens in walnut. several co-transformed transgenic j <dig> and rr <dig> lines were recovered that showed resistance to both crown gall and nematodes. a similar inhibition by gene-silencing was observed recently in rlns p. thornei and p. zeae grown in carrot mini discs and exposed to double-stranded rna via soaking. silencing of the pat- <dig> and unc- <dig> genes of p. thornei reduced reproduction by 77–81% <cit> . our results suggest a 1: <dig> concentration ratio is optimal for co-transforming walnut somatic embryos. when we employed conventional transformation using only one vector, we obtained much higher transformation efficiency. absence of competition during transformation likely accounts for this elevated efficiency. this research represents the first rnai experiments involving a migratory plant parasitic nematode, p. vulnus, by artificial feeding on transgenic walnut roots. in the experiments described here, nematodes were isolated after two months of feeding on the transformed walnut roots. several co-transformed and single-vector transformed walnut roots were used for feeding experiments. in co-transformed lines only, rolabc genes were introduced by the resident t-dna in the a. rhizogenes ri-plasmid used as a vector for plant transformation but not in the single-vector transformed lines with only pv <dig> in this research, rnai was used as a tool to suppress specific p. vulnus genes. the pv <dig> gene sequence was chosen for these rnai experiments based on its similarity to a c. elegans gene whose expression has been successfully suppressed in multiple experiments, resulting in reduced fecundity relative to untreated nematodes <cit> . pv <dig> gene was chosen for its potential to act as a negative control because rnai silencing of its c. elegans ortholog has resulted in wild-type phenotype. in migratory nematodes such as p. vulnus, the major observable phenotype is population growth, which is related to the nematodes’ fecundity and ability to feed. all motile stages feed on plant cells. although juvenile stages may feed ectoparasitically on root hairs, once the nematode has penetrated the root, feeding is restricted almost entirely to the root cortex <cit> . any paralysis or immobility will affect their feeding ability and subsequent survival or reproduction in a host. interestingly, the c. elegans ortholog of pv <dig> is a spliceosome subunit with rnai phenotypes including sterility and embryo/larval lethality <cit> . after observing similar phenotypes in p. vulnus, we can infer that this function is conserved across nematode taxa. however, the prp- <dig> sequence is sufficiently dissimilar to that of plant splicing factors that no detrimental phenotype was observed in the transformed walnut roots. more work is needed to determine whether the expressed rna has interfered with juvenile development or with egg production. independent of the transformation method, when dsrna was present we obtained successful nematode control in some transgenic lines, suggesting that silencing the pv <dig> gene orthologous to c. elegans prp- <dig> is very effective in controlling root lesion nematodes. when the pv <dig> rnai construct alone was transformed into walnut, at least three transgenic lines showed even higher pv <dig> gene expression than line <dig> and equal or better control of nematodes. all virulent a. rhizogenes strains possess a large root-inducing plasmid <cit> which introduces rol genes when used for transformation. pcr confirmed the insertion of rol genes into co-transformed embryos lines. our nematode assay results show that, independent of the rolabc genes inserted into co-transformed lines, we obtained up to 79% nematode reduction in co-transformed lines and up to 100% reduction in three single-vector transformed lines. even though rolabc genes are present in the roots of co-transformed lines and changed root morphology, these rol genes do not affect nematode feeding. while there is some evidence of altered rooting characteristics in transgenic fruit trees expressing rolabc genes <cit> , there is no evidence that rol genes affect rln control in walnuts. this is demonstrated by having a higher nematode population in line 66-1- <dig> which is a co-transformed j <dig> transgenic line possessing iaam, ipt, pv <dig> and rolabc genes. line 66-1- <dig> had only 10% nematode control. line 68-3- <dig> also has the same inserted genes as line 66-1- <dig> and had nematode control up to 79%. the single-vector transformed lines without rol genes reduced nematode population by 64-100%, depending on line. this shows that, independent of the rolabc genes, the pv <dig> rnai construct has the ability to control nematode population in walnuts. based on the c. elegans ortholog ttr- <dig> rnai phenotype , it was predicted that pv <dig> rnai should not reduce nematode populations and there was no significant difference in nematode numbers per root between lines transformed with pv <dig> and untransformed controls, showing that neither the transformation procedure itself nor silencing this putative gene affected nematode survival. our results suggest that c. elegans rnai phenotypes may be good predictors of p. vulnus rnai efficiency. this would simplify choosing other targets for suppression of p. vulnus. the <dig> bp pv <dig> rnai fragment inserted into walnut successfully interfered with nematode reproduction in some transgenic lines, leading to as much as 79% nematode control in co-transformed and 100% in some single-vector transformed roots with this fragment. similar results were obtained when four different rnai gene silencing constructs were used to transform soybean roots <cit> . all four constructs decreased the number of mature soybean cyst nematodes at <dig> days after infection by over 75%. in planta delivery of the rnai fragment to the nematode provides continued exposure of the nematode to the rnai fragments as the nematode feeds <cit> . two meloidogyne incognita genes were successfully silenced in nematodes feeding on rnai-transformed tobacco roots <cit> . the galls that formed on the rnai-transformed roots were significantly smaller in size and number than those in untransformed control plants. silencing of the m. incognita gene encoding cathepsin l-cysteine, mi-cpl- <dig> using an <dig> bp fragment reduced the number of females that could produce eggs by 60% when the nematodes were soaked in an octopamine solution <dig> days after infection <cit> . the dsrna may be ingested by the feeding nematodes through the feeding tubes. alternatively, dsrna molecules are processed by the plant rnai machinery and sirna are ingested <cit> . thus, it was reasonable to assume that the gene fragments we used could also be taken up by the nematode. we observed phenotypic differences in walnut plants transformed with rolabc genes. while our constructs had no rolabc genes in the t-dna, those three genes were inserted when we used a. rhizogenes for co-transformation. shoot and root phenotypes were consistent with the expected effects of inserted rolabc genes <cit> . rola induces wrinkled, slightly curled leaves and dense, bushy foliage in transgenic walnut plants. rolb is considered the most important rol gene for root induction. rolb increases rooting potential. in many plants, introducing rolb alone efficiently induced fast-growing, highly branched, and plagiotropic roots. the thicker, well-developed root system observed in transgenic in vitro plantlets is due to rolb, which increases tissue auxin sensitivity and alters leaf morphology <cit> . our transformed plants also had shorter internodes in shoots and increased branching in roots due to the insertion of rolc. similar results were obtained in walnut shoots <cit> . the root phenotypic characters reported here conflict with a previous report of few, fibrous roots in walnut plants transformed with rolabc <cit> . our in vitro walnut plantlets had abundant healthy, long, thick roots. we have demonstrated here that similar to other plant parasitic nematodes studied, the rln p. vulnus is amenable to dsrna-mediated rnai via feeding on transgenic plant materials containing dsrna. therefore, rlns, which are migratory endoparasites, can potentially be controlled using this technique. this result agrees with the recently published p. thornei and p. zeae results using double stranded rna-induced gene silencing via soaking <cit> and transcriptomes analysis of p. thornei and p. coffeae to confirm the presence of an efficient exogenous rnai pathway and mechanism <cit> . CONCLUSIONS silencing the genes encoding iaam, ipt, and pv <dig> can greatly decrease crown gall formation and simultaneously reduce root lesion nematode infestations in walnuts. the most efficient co-transformation was achieved when bacterial mixtures were combined in similar concentrations. a transformation system using only one vector was more effective than co-transformation in achieving higher control of rlns. the c. elegans ortholog of pv <dig> is a spliceosome subunit whose rnai phenotype includes sterility or juvenile lethality in c. elegans; our results suggest pv <dig> suppression has a similar effect on p. vulnus. pv <dig> as predicted based on knowledge of its c. elegans ortholog, did not adversely affect p. vulnus populations. these results suggest c. elegans rnai phenotypes may be good predictors for p. vulnus rnai results, which would help greatly in choosing other targets for p. vulnus suppression. viable resistance to root lesion nematodes in crop plants may be achieved in the future using rnai technology. more research is still needed to determine if the construct used in this work has interfered with juvenile development or egg production. p. vulnus feeding experiments and crown gall testing of the transformed rr <dig> and additional transformed j <dig> embryo lines are underway. after successful characterization of those lines, they will be micropropagated as walnut shoots, rooted, and the in vitro results will be confirmed in greenhouse and field tests. studying nematode population dynamics and gene expression following digestion of dsrna will provide additional information for successful control of root lesion nematodes in walnuts.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the clinical significance of the findings below. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND madagascar periwinkle has become a model plant for secondary metabolism studies <cit> . the medicinal plant c. roseus possesses a large number of terpenoid indole alkaloids among which over <dig> compounds have been isolated and identified <cit> . the production of the most valuable dimeric alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine are extremely low in wild-type c. roseus plant <cit> , and hard to be improved using cell suspension and hairy root cultures systems <cit> . in addition, it is also difficult to synthesize tias by chemical methods due to their complicated structures <cit> . until now, the tias metabolic pathway of c. roseus has become clearer. vinblastine and vincristine are the most important antitumor bisindole alkaloids, which are derived from the coupling of vindoline and catharanthine monomers. the biochemical synthesis of the six-step enzymatic conversion of tabersonine to vindoline has been studied extensively <cit> . the terminal step of vindoline biosynthesis is catalyzed by deacetylvindoline-4-o-acetyltransferase . the recent development of metabolic engineering strategy offers a promising solution to improve the tias production in c. roseus. therefore, the establishment of effective regeneration and transformation system for c. roseus is required. to date, genetic transformation of c. roseus has been mostly confined to hairy roots and suspension cells. agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation involving productions of hairy roots in c. roseus had been reported <cit> . however, the phenotypes of transgenic c. roseus plants transformed by a. rhizogenes are abnormal, such as shortened internodes, wrinkled leaves and abundant root mass <cit> . thus this kind of transgenic c. roseus plants is not suitable for the production of tias. transgenic c. roseus cell suspension cultures transformed by either agrobacterium infection or by particle bombardment had been established and studied intensively <cit> . but these transgenic cells lines do not produce alkaloids in a stable manner and their ability to accumulate tias is gradually declined by long-term subculture <cit> . recently a. tumefaciens-mediated transformation was employed in c. roseus, the transgenic callus and plants were obtained respectively <cit> . however, these transformation systems were not confirmed with other biochemical assays such as southern blot and high performance liquid chromatography . to address these issues, in the present study we developed an a. tumfaciens mediated transformation and regeneration system of c. roseus. the stable regeneration plants were successfully acquired. to demonstrate this transformation system, dat, an essential gene in tias biosynthetic pathway was overexpressed and the accumulation of vindoline was analyzed using hplc in transformants. RESULTS optimization of transformation conditions for c. roseus to develop an efficient system for producing transgenic c. roseus plants using a. tumefaciens, the association parameters were systemically investigated and optimized, including the concentration of agrobacterium and acetosyringone, co-cultivation duration, and sonication condition. the detection was performed using the a. tumefaciens-mediated gus gene transient expression. the transformation frequency was calculated as the number of kanamycin resistance plants/number of explants × <dig> firstly, we assessed the a. tumefaciens density and duration during infection. the density of a. tumefaciens culture corresponding to od600 = <dig> , <dig> and <dig> were chosen. these a. tumefaciens cultures were re-suspended to od600 = <dig> with liquid ms supplied with 100 μm acetosyringone. then the hypocotyls were treated for <dig> <dig> and 45 min respectively. the results showed that the highest gus transient expression and the relatively lower death rate for the explants were achieved using the od <dig> = <dig> of a. tumefaciens and the explants infection of 30 min . transient expression of gus gene was examined after co-culture. the data of death rates were collected after <dig> d of co-culture. hypocotyls were placed on mscp <dig> medium. a transient expression rate = number of gus+ explants/number of explants × <dig> b death rate = number of died explants/number of explants × <dig> c values represent means for <dig> explants per treatment, replicated three times. mean ± se in each column followed by the same letter are not significantly different according to tukey’s multiple comparison test . secondly, the effects of co-cultivation duration and acetosyringone concentration on transformation frequency were optimized separately. the co-cultivation with a. tumefaciens between <dig> to <dig> d and the acetosyringone concentration on t-dna delivery were tested. the results showed that the highest frequency of gus transient expression and the relatively lower death rate were obtained for the explants with <dig> d co-cultivation and 100 μm of acetosyringone in co-culture medium in dark . thirdly, the effects of sonication power and time on transformation frequency were investigated. agrobacterium provides one of the main vehicles for introducing foreign dna into plants based on its ti-plasmid. however, one disadvantage of agrobacterium transformation is the host’s specificity, which results in low efficiency in certain species <cit> . sonication-assisted agrobacterium-mediated transformation offers an option to enhance agrobacterium transient or stable transformation efficiency in different plant tissues <cit> . the explanation might be the micro wounding formed by sonication on the surface and sub-surface layers of targeted tissue, which secrets more phenolic compounds and enhances the efficiency of transformation <cit> . up to now, the saat has been successfully employed to enhance transformation efficiency in several plant species, including kidney bean <cit> , radish <cit> , flax <cit> and chickpea <cit> . however, sonication alone has its negative effects on survival rate of the explants. so in this work the intensity and period of sonication were evaluated in order to seek the optimization of sonication application on c. roseus transformation. before a. tumefaciens infection, c. roseus hypocotyls were transferred into liquid ms medium with 100 μm acetosyringone, and then sonicated with different power and time , respectively. the results are shown as figure <dig> after <dig> d co-cultivation, we found that the transient expression of gus stain was enhanced with the increase of sonication time and power . this result indicated that the transient transformation efficiency can be improved with the sonication treatment, which is accord with previous reports <cit> . the growth of explants was further observed by transferring them to the mscp <dig> culture medium . the sonication power of 0 ~ 60 w and 0 ~ 15 min had no influence on the survival rate of these explants . however, the survival rate was decreased to 45% when the ultrasound treatment increased to 80 w and 15 min. furthermore, when the sonication power arrived at 100 w, the survival rate of explants was decreased remarkably. altogether, the sonication treatment of 80 w and 10 min can improve the transformation efficiency of c. roseus while keeping relatively high surviving rate . fourthly, the influence of kanamycin concentration on plant regeneration was assessed. the types of selectable markers and the selection pressure are very important factors for successful transformation <cit> . the neomycin phosphotransferase gene which confers on the plant resistance to kanamycin is used in this protocol. selection during callus induction and shoot initiation encourages regeneration of putative transgenic plants <cit> . in the present study, three media supplied with different concentrations of kanamycin were prepared and used in sequence. considering the growth of plant itself may strengthen resistance to kanamycin, the relatively higher kanamycin concentration was used in the media from mscp <dig> to mscp <dig> from figure 3a, the regeneration frequency of transformed and non-transformed explants was declined with the increase of kanamycin concentration. with the kanamycin concentration of 40 mg/l in mscp <dig> and 50 mg/l in mscp <dig> , the differentiation of non-transformed explants was inhibited comparing to transformed explants. but the regeneration frequency of non-transformed explants is still from 13% to 23%. when the kanamycin concentration higher than 70 mg/l in mscp <dig> and 90 mg/l in mscp <dig> , the regeneration of non-transformed explants was almost completed inhibited. the representative images are shown as in figure 3b, which exhibit the contrast of growth state between non-transformed and transformed explants. at last, 40 mg/l in mscp <dig> 70 mg/l in mscp <dig> and 90 mg/l in mscp <dig> kanamycin were used for selecting transformed plants due to the relatively high regeneration efficiency of transformed explants and low regeneration efficiency of non-transformed explants . regeneration of transgenic c. roseus using hypocotyls as explants, callus induction, shoot initiation and root initiation media containing kanamycin were employed in sequence. after agrobacterium-mediated transformation and <dig> d co-cultivation in dark, transgenic calli were induced by growing the hypocotyl explants for <dig> d in selective medium with kanamycin. then the induced transgenic calli were subjected to additional two rounds of selection on medium containing higher levels of kanamycin , which helps to eliminate false-positive plants. in this experiment, we found most explants became brown gradually and died except the putative transformants. the green shoots of putative transformants that appeared in <dig> d were transferred onto roots induction medium . at last, the rooted plants grew normally after transplanted to soil in the green house . it took 3 ~ 4 months using hypocotyls as starting materials from inoculation with a. tumefaciens to transplant to soil. the procedures of c. roseus transformation were showed in figure <dig> molecular characterization of transgenic c. roseus plants with gus to confirm the transformation events, histochemical analysis of gus activity was carried out in putative kanamycin resistant transgenic lines. gus positive blue coloration was visibly detected in all transgenic tissues stained with x-gluc reagent . however the gus staining was not detected in the wild type plants which were neither sonicated nor transformed with agrobacterium . to determine the presence and the integration of transgene in kanamycin resistant plants, pcr and dna blot hybridization were performed with genomic dna. first the putative transgenic plants were screened by pcr using gus gene-specific primers to detect the presence of target gene in host. the representative results are shown as in figure 6e. it indicates the 400 bp fragments of gus genes in kanamycin-resistant transformed plants were amplified, which is the same as positive control. no specific amplification product was detected in non-transgenic control plants. the transgenic plant integrated with foreign gene was further verified by southern blot with the fragment of gus as probe. the genomic dna was obtained from two independent pcr-positive and gus-positive transgenic c. roseus plants. the southern results indicate that the t-dna was inserted into genome of both transgenic plants. one transgenic plant has a single copy and another has two copies, while no signal is detected in the untransformed control . altogether, the results of molecular analyses confirm that these regenerated plants are stably integrated with gus gene. in this study we obtained <dig> putatively transformed plants by transformed the explants three times using same method. the percentage of explants producing regenerates was 19% and the frequency of explants producing independent transgenic plants was established at 11%. analysis of transgenic c. roseus plants with overexpressed dat in order to validate the established transformation system, the dat was over expressed in catharanthus plants using the same transformation procedure. <dig> independent transgenic plants were confirmed by southern blot and/or pcr analyses . with the fragment of dat as probe, the result of southern blot show that the transformants contained <dig> to <dig> more copies of dat gene than the negative control. the dat mrna level was analyzed using real-time pcr in <dig> independently dat transformed c. roseus plants. the results reveal that the expression level of dat was increased in all the transgenic plants . especially for d <dig> d <dig> and d <dig> transgenic plants, the expression of dat was significantly increased by <dig> , <dig> and <dig> -fold respectively. at last, the yield of vindoline was determined by hplc in dat overexpressed transgenic plants. the pcambia <dig> transgenic and wild type plants were served as negative controls. with dat overexpression, the results show that the production of vindoline was increased in all transformants . the amount of vindoline was <dig> ~ <dig> μg/mg in transgenic plants with over-expressed dat, and about <dig> μg/mg in both pcambia <dig> and wild-type plants. especially for the d <dig> the accumulated vindoline was <dig> μg/mg , <dig> -folds than that of controls. this finding is consistent with the real-time pcr results, which suggests that dat expression is associated with the accumulation of vindoline. however, further investigations will be needed involving more number of transformed plants to decipher the precise role of dat genes in the regulation of tias pathway in c. roseus. because the transformation of c. roseus at whole plant level had no report before, the functions of genes in tias were investigated using hair root or suspension cell transformation so far. here the established transformation system provides a potential possibility to investigate the effect of gene expression upon the alkaloids yields on c. roseus whole plant, and would contribute to the successful modification of the medicinal plants for higher natural product yields. CONCLUSIONS here we report an agrobacterium-mediated transformation and regeneration system for c. roseus. the parameters influencing the transformation frequency are systematically investigated, including the concentration of agrobacterium and acetosyringone, co-cultivation duration, sonication condition and selection pressure of kanamycin. the results show that the transformation frequency arrived at 11%. in order to validate the established transformation system, the key gene, dat, in tias biosynthetic pathway was overexpressed. the hplc results reveal that the production of vindoline was enhanced in transgenic plants with dat overexpression. in conclusion, all the results obtained show that the c. roseus transformation protocols developed in this work has great potential to be used in the discovery of genes function in tias biosynthetic pathway, in addition to improve the productions of tias.",

    "prompt": "Outline the prominent clinical observations in a short summary. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND l-ornithine, a non-essential amino acid and an important constituent of the urea cycle, is the precursor of other amino acids, such as citrulline and arginine. it is effective for the treatment and prophylaxis of liver diseases <cit> , and has also been applied to wound healing <cit> . recently, it was demonstrated that l-ornithine supplementation increased serum levels of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor- <dig> after heavy-resistance exercise in strength-trained athletes <cit> . many studies have reported that high yields of l-ornithine can be produced from a citrulline- or arginine-requiring mutant of a coryneform bacterium obtained by classical mutagenesis <cit> . although this mutant can produce a high yield of l-ornithine, its culture is unstable owing to reversion of the auxotrophic phenotype, which causes the production of l-ornithine to drop markedly. several recent reports have described progress in metabolic engineering of microorganisms for l-ornithine production. lee and cho reported that an engineered escherichia coli produced <dig> mg l-ornithine per gram of dry cell weight , and that addition of glutamate to the culture favoured l-ornithine production in the engineered e. coli <cit> . hwang et al. reported that co-overexpression of argcjbd in a triple-gene knockout strain c. glutamicum atcc <dig> resulted in a cellular l-ornithine content of <dig> mg/g dcw and a concentration of l-ornithine in the culture medium of <dig> mg/l <cit> . proline can be converted into l-ornithine by ornithine cyclodeaminase, which is a key enzyme responsible for enhancing l-ornithine production by c. glutamicum in proline-supplemented media <cit> . huang and cho reported that over-expression of the ncgl <dig> open reading frame, exhibiting n-acetylglutamate synthase activity, increased l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum by 39% <cit> . recently, the same workers deleted the gluconate kinase gene gntk of c. glutamicum atcc <dig> to obtain c. glutamicum sjc <dig> which produced <dig> g/l of l-ornithine <cit> . the l-ornithine producing strain c. glutamicum atcc <dig> named orn <dig> was constructed and shown to produce l-ornithine from arabinose when arabad from e. coli was expressed <cit> . recently, this group also constructed an engineered c. glutamicum orn <dig> to effectively produce l-ornithine from xylose <cit> . in our previous paper <cit> , we constructed a strain of c. glutamicum in which three genes had been deleted. this strain, named atcc <dig> , produced l-ornithine of <dig> g/l in the optimal medium <cit> . adaptive evolution strategies have been proven a feasible and efficient technique to achieve improved cellular properties without requiring metabolic or regulatory details of the strain <cit> . the defining feature of adaptive evolution involves applying a selection pressure that favours the growth of mutants with the traits of interest. growth-coupled adaptive evolution can significantly increase yields <cit> . when combined with metabolic engineering, adaptive evolution is known as metabolic evolution engineering. the evolved strains can be further optimised by metabolic engineering. metabolic evolution has been successfully employed for the improved production of succinate <cit> , l-alanine <cit> , and dihydroxyacetone <cit> . however, to our knowledge, metabolic evolution engineering has never been reported to boost the production of l-ornithine. in this study, we first deleted the spee gene of c. glutamicum atcc <dig> to obtain c. glutamicum atcc <dig> , which was then modified using growth-coupled adaptive evolution to improve l-ornithine production. after comparing the transcriptional levels of select genes of the evolved strain with those of the parent strain, additional genetic modifications were introduced to the evolved strain to further improve l-ornithine production. the mechanism of l-ornithine production by the metabolic evolved strain was also investigated by analysing transcriptional levels of genes of interest, as well as nadph concentrations. RESULTS construction of the triple gene deletion c. glutamicum for adaptive evolution in our previous paper <cit> , proteomic analysis demonstrated that the spermidine synthase encoded by the spee gene was more abundant in c. glutamicum engineered to overproduce l-ornithine than in wild-type c. glutamicum. the upregulation might result in the degradation of l-ornithine. thus, we deleted the spee gene of c. glutamicum to obtain c. glutamicum Δape. as expected, the deletion of the spee gene enhanced l-ornithine production. the c. glutamicum Δape strain produced <dig> ± <dig> g/l of l-ornithine, which is higher than that of c. glutamicum . thus, c. glutamicum Δape was used as the parent strain for adaptive evolution. *significantly different from the parent strain. #significantly different from Δape <dig> adaptive evolution to improve l-ornithine production, c. glutamicum Δape was subjected to adaptive evolution driven by growth-based selection. this process comprised two stages . first, glucose and l-ornithine were added into the fermentation medium to overcome their inhibitions for growth and overproduction of metabolite. screening a mutant resistant to substrate and end product is one common strategy for strain improvement by classical mutagenesis. at the later stage, only glucose was added at gradually increasing levels, and no l-ornithine was needed. after <dig> days of adaptive evolution, one of the clones, referred to as c. glutamicum Δape <dig> was chosen for further study. the c. glutamicum Δape <dig> strain produced <dig> ± <dig> g/l of l-ornithine. the yield was about 20% higher than that of the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape . however, the l-ornithine content of the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape <dig> was similar to that of the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape. this suggests that the increased l-ornithine level of the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape <dig> is caused by the increased cell density. characterisation of the evolved strain using qrt-pcr and sequence analysis in order to understand the mechanism of the increased l-ornithine level in the evolved strain, we analysed the transcriptional levels of genes that encode enzymes involved in l-ornithine biosynthesis in the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape <dig> these genes comprise pgi , pfka , gap , pyk , pyc , glta , gdh , argb and argj . and then we compared the data with that obtained in the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape. the results are presented in figure 2a. all of these genes in the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape <dig> are upregulated, with the smallest degree of upregulation seen for the argb gene. in an attempt to identify mutations that confer the high-yield phenotype, we sequenced the above genes of the evolved strain Δape <dig> and compared the results with sequences of the same genes from c. glutamicum atcc <dig> analysis of the sequences of the pgi, pfka, gapa, pyk, pyc, glta, gdh, argb, and argj genes in the evolved strain failed to identify any mutations relative to the parent strain. genetic modification of the evolved strain the results shown in figure 2a suggest that expression of the argb gene may be the bottleneck for l-ornithine production by the evolved strain. thus, we first over-expressed either of the c. glutamicum or e. coli argb genes in the evolved strain. over-expression of either of the two argb genes indeed enhanced l-ornithine concentration and content, with over-expression of c. glutamicum argb increasing levels of l-ornithine concentration to a greater degree than that achieved by the over-expression of e. coli argb . the expression of the arg operon for control of the l-ornithine biosynthesis pathway is regulated by the arginine repressor argr. in addition, the dna-binding affinity of argr to the upstream of argb gene was suggested to play an important role in l-ornithine biosynthesis in c. glutamicum <cit> . deletion of the argr gene is another strategy for enhancing the level of expression of the arg operon. thus, we deleted the argr gene of the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape <dig> to generate c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> as expected, c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> produced <dig> ± <dig> g/l of l-ornithine . the concentration of l-ornithine was 27% higher than that of c. glutamicum Δape <dig> to investigate the mechanism of l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> we analysed the transcriptional levels of the genes that encode enzymes involved in l-ornithine biosynthesis in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> by using qrt-pcr, and compared the data with that obtained in c. glutamicum Δape . deletion of the argr gene promoted the upregulations of the transcript levels of the pgi, pfka, argb, and argj genes. the respective transcriptional levels of the pgi, pfka, argb, and argj genes in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> are about <dig> -, <dig> -, <dig> -, and <dig> -fold higher than those in the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape. in contrast, the respective levels of the same transcripts in c. glutamicum Δape <dig> are only about <dig> -, <dig> -, <dig> -, and <dig> -fold higher than those in the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape . three reactions in the l-ornithine biosynthesis pathway involve nadph. these are the reactions catalysed by nadp-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, nadp-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase, and nadp-dependent n-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase. to analyse the effect of nadph availability on l-ornithine accumulation, we deleted the argr gene of the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape to obtain c. glutamicum Δaper, and then analysed the nadph contents of the two strains. as expected, c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> produced more nadph and l-ornithine than c. glutamicum Δaper . to better understand the effect of nadph, we compared the transcript levels of the genes involved in nadph synthesis in the c. glutamicum strains Δape6937r <dig> and Δaper. the results are presented in figure <dig> in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> the genes involved in nadph synthesis were upregulated by <dig> -, <dig> - and <dig> -fold, respectively . the ppnk gene was also upregulated by <dig> -fold . therefore, we examined whether the increased nadph levels are caused by the upregulations of the transcriptional levels of these genes in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> we over-expressed these genes in c. glutamicum Δaper. the results are presented in table <dig> over-expression of the zwf, gnd and ppnk genes indeed increased the concentration of nadph in c. glutamicum Δaper. however, only over-expression of the ppnk gene promoted l-ornithine production. it suggests that only the increased nadph level caused by the elevated transcriptional level of the ppnk gene promoted l-ornithine production. *significantly different from the control strain. fermentation of the strain generated by metabolic evolution for a more detailed view on l-ornithine production, c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> was cultured in a 5-l bioreactor , and was found to grow in a diauxic manner. the maximum l-ornithine concentration and yield was obtained at <dig> h, at which time all glucose in the medium had been consumed. discussion in this study, we first deleted the spee gene to enhance l-ornithine production . spermidine synthase encoded by spee catalyzes the formation of spermidine from putrescine. although the genes involved in the biosynthesis of putrescine remain unknown, cells of c. glutamicum contain putrescine and polyaminies <cit> . the deletion of the spee gene blocked putrescine to be converted into spermidine and might alleviate the degradation of l-ornithine. however, the real reason of promoting l-ornithine production by the deletion of the spee gene should be further investigated. sequence data of the nine genes of c. glutamicum Δape <dig> we characterised at the transcript level failed to uncover any mutations in the evolved strain. it is possible that mutations in other genes may have conferred the observed phenotypes. these might include other genes that encode enzymes responsible for l-ornithine biosynthesis or transcription factors that regulate the expression of the sequenced genes. kutyna et al. also reported that there were no apparent mutations in the saccharomyces cerevisiae b2-c <dig> they evolved to generate elevated yields of glycerol <cit> . further work will be required to identify the genetic determinants of these traits. in c. glutamicum Δape <dig> and Δape6937r <dig> elevated transcriptional levels of the genes involved in the upstream pathway of glutamate biosynthesis indicated increased availability of endogenous glutamate compared with the parental strain. pyruvate kinase is a major bottleneck for glutamate production, and over-expression of the pyc gene improved glutamate production in c. glutamicum atcc <dig> <cit> . shirai et al. reported that the fluxes of the reactions catalysed by pgi, pfka, gap, pyk, pyc, glta, and gdh were increased with glutamate production in c. glutamicum <cit> . in our previous paper <cit> , these enzymes were more abundant in c. glutamicum engineered to overproduce l-ornithine than in wild-type c. glutamicum. it is thought that increasing the availability of endogenous glutamate might increase l-ornithine production. lee and cho reported that the availability of glutamate was a rate-limiting factor in l-ornithine accumulation, and that addition of glutamate in the media increased l-ornithine production in engineered e. coli <cit> . however, the same group reported that the intracellular concentration and supply of glutamate is not a rate-limiting step for l-ornithine production in an l-ornithine-producer c. glutamicum sj <dig> owing to the presence of rate limiting steps in l-ornithine biosynthesis downstream of glutamate synthesis in c. glutamicum sj <dig> <cit> . they also reported that the increased availability of glutamate might increase l-ornithine accumulation in certain genetic backgrounds <cit> . the transcriptional levels of the argb and argj genes were much higher than those of the genes that encode enzymes that act upstream of glutamate in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> . this indicates that there is no rate-limiting step in l-ornithine synthesis downstream of the synthesis of glutamate in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> thus, the elevated transcriptional levels of the genes involved in the upstream pathway of glutamate biosynthesis may be one reason of the increased l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> this study demonstrated that nadph availability and l-ornithine production are strongly correlated. production of l-ornithine requires <dig> mol of nadph per mole of l-ornithine produced by c. glutamicum. increases in the levels of zwf, gnd, and icd transcripts can increase nadph availability in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> however, increased levels of zwf and gnd transcripts can drive the carbon metabolic flux from the embden–meyerhof–parnas pathway to the pentose phosphate pathway. moreover, given that the pp pathway is coupled with co <dig> production, direct enhancement of the pp pathway may result in release of co <dig> thereby decreasing the yield of l-ornithine. thus, enhanced carbon flux through the pp pathway, caused by the upregulation of zwf and gnd at the transcriptional level, inhibits l-ornithine production. our results also demonstrated this point. over-expression of the zwf and gnd genes could not increase l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δaper although it could enhance nadph concentration . these suggest that the increased level of l-ornithine production in the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> was not caused by the increased levels of zwf and gnd transcripts. atp-dependent nad kinase encoded by ppnk catalyzes the phosphorylation of nad to nadp. increased transcriptional levels of ppnk increased the size of the nadp pool, thus potentially increasing the abundance of nadph. our results demonstrated that the increased level of ppnk transcript indeed enhanced the abundance of nadph in the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> . lindner et al. reported that over-expression of ppnk improved l-lysine production in c. glutamicum by 12% <cit> . overexpression of nadk, which encodes nad kinase, increased the nadph/nadp ratio, which in turn enhanced thymidine biosynthesis in e. coli <cit> . our result also demonstrated that over-expression of the ppnk gene enhanced l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δaper. thus, the elevated level of ppnk transcript that increase the availability of nadph may be another reason of increased l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> other strategies have been developed to improve nadph availability. over-expression of e. coli pntab genes, which encode a membrane-bound transhydrogenase enhanced nadph availability, and thus increased l-lysine levels in c. glutamicum <cit> . in this study, over-expression of e. coli pntab genes enhanced nadph availability , and thus increased l-ornithine levels in c. glutamicumΔaper . simultaneous chromosomal overexpression of transhydrogenase and nad kinase genes had a effect on increasing nadph supply and improving anaerobic isobutanol production <cit> . replacement of the endogenous nad-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase with the nadp-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans also increased both nadph availability and l-lysine production in c. glutamicum <cit> . the inactivation of the gluconate kinase gene led to a <dig> % increase in intracellular nadph concentration and a <dig> % increase in l-ornithine production <cit> . these strategies may be useful for further improving l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of metabolic evolution engineering to increase production of l-ornithine by c. glutamicum. the yield of our engineered stain is unprecedented in any engineered c. glutamicum strain of which we are aware, including that described in our previous paper <cit> and that reported by hwang and cho <cit> . to date, the highest titre of l-ornithine reported in the literature was <dig> g/l, as reported by lee et al. <cit> . those researchers achieved this yield by using a 7-l fed-batch fermentation process with a glucose-feeding strategy and an l-arginine auxotrophic mutant of brevibacterium ketoglutamicum atcc <dig> the titre of this auxotrophic mutant, which was generated using classical mutagenesis, was only <dig> g/l in batch culture <cit> . this suggests that the yield of the new strains described in this study may be enhanced by growth using fed-batch fermentation technology. CONCLUSIONS we first deleted the spee gene of c. glutamicum atcc <dig> , then evolved by a growth-based selection process for <dig> passages to generate c. glutamicum Δape <dig> and finally deleted the argr gene of the evolved strain to obtain c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> the c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> strain produced <dig> g/l of l-ornithine in a 5-l bioreactor, a level unprecedented in any engineered strain. it has been demonstrated that the increased l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> is dependent on the increased availabilities of glutamate caused by the elevated levels of transcripts involved in the upstream pathway of glutamate biosynthesis and the increased availabilities of nadph caused by the elevated level of ppnk transcript. the availability of nadph plays an important role in l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum.",

    "prompt": "Produce a summary emphasizing changes from baseline values. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND accurate descriptions of protein function usually arise through repeated cycles of laboratory experiments and publication, followed by expert annotation by database curators . this is, of course, a time consuming process. computational sequence comparison methods are then typically applied to extend these annotations to related proteins from the same or a different organism. if adequate precautions are taken <cit> , this annotation transfer rapidly brings added value to what would otherwise be a large collection of unannotated sequences. unfortunately, a substantial proportion of proteins from fully sequenced organisms remain unannotated after the application of manual and automated annotation methods; for the human proteome this fraction is approximately 40% . furthermore, many of the existing annotations are only partial, and one must also remember that proteins can have more than one function. high-throughput technologies are helping to provide additional sources of information that can be used to predict protein function, typically through the detection of physical protein-protein interactions, or the analysis of gene expression patterns. ultimately, however, a protein's amino acid sequence dictates its behaviour once it has been synthesised, and so methods for deducing function directly from sequence are needed. alignment-based sequence comparison methods have already been mentioned as a suitable approach, but these have limited use at large evolutionary distances where annotation transfer can be unreliable. it should also be noted that alignment techniques generally require the conservation of whole domains and are tuned for optimal performance on water-soluble globular proteins. structure-based function prediction also places an emphasis on whole globular domains. many aspects of protein function have been attributed to sequence features that are generally found outside globular domains, including signals for subcellular targeting, degradation, calmodulin binding and post-translational modifications <cit> . recently, disordered regions of proteins have been receiving more attention and are no longer considered functionally inert <cit> . these observations highlight the need for computational techniques that can link short regions of sequence and/or the global properties of proteins directly to function, without recourse to alignments or domain family databases. so far, only a few researchers have begun to address this problem <cit> . both used a set of precalculated sequence features to describe each protein in their dataset. these features were then used to predict membership, or otherwise, to predefined functional classes. in king et al. <cit> , the features included single amino acid and dipeptide frequencies, protein molecular weight, aliphatic index, hydropathicity and predicted secondary structure. annotation keywords for a protein and its homologues were also incoporated into the classification scheme. the target functional classes were taken from a hierarchical scheme used at that time for genome annotation by the sanger centre. jensen et al. omitted the amino acid frequency and keyword information but additionally included predictions of various post-translational modifications, transmembrane helices and protein targeting <cit> . the initial study by jensen et al. <cit> attempted to predict a set of <dig> general functional classes proposed by tigr and the six enzyme classes of the ec scheme. their subsequent study <cit> used <dig> categories from the gene ontology <cit> as targets, and found that reasonable predictions could be made for <dig> of them. it is important to note that neither of these studies involved the discovery of novel sequence motifs/features more extensive than adjacent amino acid pairs. in this study we address the issues of sequence feature/motif discovery and functional categorisation simultaneously. this is achieved using a co-evolutionary algorithm which produces two types of protein classifiers. the first classifier is fed with a single amino acid sequence and predicts membership of a functional category which has been assigned by the second classifier on the basis of swiss-prot annotation words. the sequence classifier makes use of one or more evolved regular expressions which are used to detect the presence or absence of sequence motifs. the annotation classifier simply uses boolean logic to combine the presence or absence of certain words in the annotation. we call this a \"self-supervised\" data mining approach in which a moving target is used to train the sequence classifiers. this is in contrast to standard supervised learning approaches where the target is fixed and predetermined, and unsupervised learning where no targets are involved. the results we obtain reinforce the widely held view that sequences hold intrinsic information about subcellar localisation <cit> since we find the strongest correlations between sequence features and annotation words that describe subcellar compartments. we also find that sequence features can be linked to some general functions, such as biosynthesis and transcription, which cannot be completely explained by large overlaps with the cellular compartments in which they occur . the behaviour of the predictors we obtain can be analysed and the sequence features associated with various functions are presented. finally, future development and applications of this new approach are discussed. RESULTS discovery of sequence-to-function relationships briefly , a non-redundant set of <dig> proteins was generated such that no two sequences share more than 10% sequence identity. each protein is tagged with one or more words from its uniprot/swiss-prot annotation, hereafter referred to as \"annotation words\". the data is split into training and testing sets of <dig> and <dig> proteins respectively. our \"self-supervised\" evolutionary learning approach is then applied to find sequence-to-function relationships. it does this by simultaneously searching for sequence- and annotation-based classification rules which overlap as far as possible on the training set proteins, as illustrated in figure <dig> figure <dig> shows the outcome and progress of a few hand-picked runs. an example of an evolved sequence-to-function predictor is given in figure <dig> this predictor has found a correlation between the annotation of a protein with the words \"rna\" or \"nuclear\" and an arithmetic inequality based on sequence pattern frequencies . the evolved predictor shown in figure <dig> has \"chosen\" a single annotation word target , and the sequence classifier again uses several sequence patterns, including one three-residue pattern . the plots in figure <dig> show the progression of the correlation between the functional class predicted from sequence and the functional class assigned based on annotation words as the evolutionary search proceeds. the performance on the test set proteins tends to lag behind the training set performance, however it does usually follow an upward trend. the averaged results from <dig> independent runs are shown in the upper part of table <dig> the mean correlation coefficient between predicted and real functional class for the test set proteins is only <dig> but this is significantly greater than the correlations obtained from two control experiments . in one control, sequences are shuffled with respect to their annotation words . in the second control, each amino acid sequence is shuffled in a residue-wise manner prior to training . in our previous work <cit> , where we used a similar approach to discover sequence features associated with the nuclear localisation of proteins, the mean correlation coefficient obtained from single predictors was <dig> . why is the performance with the new self-supervised method so much worse? in this work, we made two major changes to the approach, which are described below. firstly, during dataset construction, there are no special quality controls imposed on negative examples . in our previous work, the non-nuclear proteins in our training and testing sets had to have some positive annotation for another cellular compartment, which helps eliminate proteins whose nuclear localisation status is unknown. this is standard practice in protein function prediction . therefore the datasets used in this study have a lower contrast between positive and negative examples, and lower prediction accuracies are expected. indeed, when the methods used in this work are applied to the higher-contrast dataset in ref. <cit> , the mean correlation coefficient rises to <dig> . the second change in our approach is that the search algorithm is encouraged to find sequence-order dependent features . this actually decreases the performance of the evolved predictors, but we are prepared to accept this in order to find potentially interesting sequence motifs. when the mechanism encouraging sequence-order dependent feature discovery is switched off, the mean correlation coefficient rises to <dig> when using the higher-contrast training data as described above. this is close to the <dig> correlation obtained in ref. <cit> , indicating that the two methodological changes account for the lower prediction performances presented here. function predictors obtained directly from our self-supervised approach unfortunately do not have either the specificity or sensitivity to be useful to biologists. however, the value of our approach lies in the discovery of potentially novel sequence-to-function relationships. at a later stage, more accurate predictors can be obtained by removing the sequence-order dependency, by the use of jury predictors, and by constructing higher contrast datasets with the help of expert biological knowledge to define both positive and negative examples. so which sequence-to-function relationships are discovered with this technique? the most common annotation words used to form functional categories are also shown in the upper half of table <dig> the cellular compartments dominate this list, as would be expected from previous studies which have explored the relationship between sequence and subcellular localisation <cit> . beyond cellular compartments to explore the relationship between sequence and more specific functions we performed another <dig> runs where the major cellular compartment words had been removed from the vocabulary used to generate annotation classifiers. two other small changes were made to the protocol as detailed in methods. one hand-picked predictor is shown in figure <dig> one of the longer and perhaps more interesting regular expressions is { <dig> } , which can be interpreted as \"matches between <dig> and <dig> q's followed by e, f, m, q or w followed by a, d, e, i, m, n, p or w\". patterns similar to this will be discussed in the context of transcription later in this paper. the corresponding performance plot in figure <dig> shows the test set correlation rising as the run progresses. the mean correlations for these experiments are shown in the lower half of table <dig> there is a larger gap between the training and testing correlations which indicates more overfitting but, as with the first set of <dig> runs, the mean test set correlation is significantly greater than either of the two controls . the results indicate that some aspects of function are encoded in sequence features that are detectable and generalisable with this approach. the <dig> most common annotation words used to define functional categories are listed in the lower half of table <dig> the relationship between the top three words: \"inhibits\", \"biosynthesis\" and \"transcription\" and the compartments \"secreted\", \"cytoplasmic\" and \"nuclear\" will be discussed in a following section. intra-family motifs if our training and testing datasets are constructed with a less strict sequence identity cutoff, our algorithm is able to discover motifs that are present across multiple sequence family members. for example, using a 50% cutoff we find that the h-r-d motif is frequently associated with the term \"kinase\" . encouragingly, the kinase h-r-d motif has been mentioned several times in the literature <cit> . however, intra-family motifs are not the subject of this study, and a strict 10% sequence identity cutoff is used throughout. the predictor map we next analyse the behaviour of all <dig> self-supervised predictors by comparing the binary outputs of their evolved sequence_classifier subroutines on the <dig> test set sequences. thus each predictor is represented by a <dig> element binary vector, and these are clustered using kohonen's self-organizing map <cit> . the som is a competitive spatial clustering technique which effectively \"flattens\" high-dimensional data onto the low-dimensional grid, preserving relationships in the input data as far as possible. the aim of the clustering is to group together predictors which produce positive predictions for similar subsets of the test set. figure <dig> shows the <dig> predictors projected onto an <dig> × <dig> som. the number of \"a-\" and \"b-type\" predictors which cluster to each grid node are shown in black text. below this, the frequently occuring annotation words in the annotation_classifier subroutines are shown in coloured text . the non-random distribution of the annotation words is clear, for example many \"secreted\" predictors map to the upper left corner of the map, \"inhibits\" predictors to the upper right corner, and so on. while this clustering conveniently summarises the different predictor behaviours, it is actually more informative to study the frequencies of the annotation words belonging to the test set sequences which are positively predicted by the predictors in each cluster. therefore figure <dig> also shows shaded inset boxes which list the annotation words whose observed frequency in positively predicted proteins is three or more times the expected background frequency . we now discuss an example to aid the interpretation of figure <dig> the grid node located in row two, column seven has <dig> predictors allocated to it. a majority use the word \"transcription\" in their annotation_classifier subroutine, and six of the <dig> use the word \"development\". these two words are usually present in the same logical expression \"transcription or development\" . the corresponding over-represented test set words include \"repressor\", \"repression\" and several other dna-related words. transcription is well known to involve activator and repressor proteins/domains and the development of multicellular organisms is largely controlled at the level of transcription. therefore the over-representation of \"repressor\" and \"repression\" indicates that these <dig> predictors are correctly predicting involvement in transcription or development for some of the previously unseen test set proteins. interestingly, \"ubiquitin\" is also over-represented in the positive test set sequences. we have since found evidence in the literature that ubiquitination is indeed important in transcription <cit> . note that although the more common annotation words do not appear in the shaded inset boxes of figure <dig> there is still generally good agreement between target annotation words and over-represented test set annotation words for each cluster of predictors. prediction of function vs. compartment distinct positioning on predictor map do our self-supervised function predictors actually predict specific functions ? or are they simply predicting targetting to a subcellular compartment in which a particular function is predominant ? this question can in part be answered by studying figure <dig> for instance, there is a cluster of \"transcription\" predictors at row two, columns 6– <dig> which is distinct from the large group of \"nuclear\" predictors at the bottom of the map. this indicates that a different set of proteins are positively predicted by these two different clusters of predictors. likewise, there is a separation between the \"secreted\" predictors and the \"inhibits\" predictors . on the whole we see separation between the \"a-type\" runs and the \"b-type\" runs , but this could be a consequence of the minor differences in the protocols of these runs . therefore we chose to produce a set of fixed-target function predictors under identical conditions so that fair comparisons can be made. fixed-target function predictors a fixed-target predictor is produced with the standard supervised learning approach and is implemented simply by hard-coding the annotation_classifier subroutine with one or more chosen annotation words. to illustrate this, the hard-coded subroutine for a \"secreted\" predictor would look identical to the evolved subroutine shown in figure <dig> the targets were chosen manually by examining the predictor map for the functions most commonly used by the self-supervised approach . for each target function, a combined jury predictor is made using the outputs of <dig> independently evolved classifiers. the consensus prediction score for a given sequence is simply the fraction of the classifiers which \"voted positive\". the performance of these fixed-target predictors is summarised in figure <dig> with accuracy vs. coverage shown at different score thresholds. for most target functions, the accuracy increases as the threshold increases, with a corresponding decrease in coverage. this plot shows that the accuracy of prediction to cellular compartments is generally higher than the accuracy of function predictions . correlations between function predictors there are three ways to analyse the overlap between function and compartment. first we can look at consensus prediction scores produced by different predictors on the same set of proteins. table <dig> shows the correlation coefficients between the prediction scores of various pairs of predictors over the <dig> test set proteins. to give an idea what the maximum expected correlation might be we have included three additional jury predictors which are copies of three selected cellular compartment predictors . these three copies give the highest correlations as expected. the next-highest correlation comes from the \"nuclear\" vs. \"transcription\" comparison; the actual distribution of scores is shown in figure <dig> from this we can conclude that proteins with a good \"transcription\" score generally also have a good \"nuclear\" score, but proteins with good \"nuclear\" scores do not always have good \"transcription\" scores. this agrees with the commonsense dictum that \"a protein can be nuclear without being transcription-related but it can't be transcription-related without being nuclear\". these results suggest that the predictors have some ability to differentiate between transcription-related function and nuclear localisation. clearly though there is also considerable overlap between the behaviour of the predictors. the correlation between prediction scores for \"inhibits\" and \"secreted\" is also quite strong ). again it seems that a high score for the function is usually accompanied by a high score for the compartment. the scores for \"cytoplasmic\" and \"biosynthesis\" also correlate well , but the distribution in figure <dig> indicates that biosynthetic proteins are not simply a subset of cytoplasmic proteins . swapped training and testing targets the second approach to determine if predictors can distinguish between function and compartment is to compare the performance of predictors trained on function but tested on compartment and vice versa. this is shown for the \"nuclear\" & \"transcription\" pair in figure <dig> again using accuracy vs. coverage plots . the plot shows that the \"nuclear\" prediction performance is roughly the same, regardless of the target used during training . this could be expected, again from the common knowledge that \"all transcription proteins are nuclear\". when tested on \"transcription\" prediction performance, however, the predictors trained specifically for this function perform better, suggesting that sequence features specific to \"transcription\" have been learnt. when comparing predictors trained and tested on the different combinations of \"secreted\" and \"inhibits\" ), we see that the function-trained predictor is better at predicting the compartment than the compartment-trained predictor when the coverage is between <dig> and <dig> . this is surprising, but could be explained by a large overlap between the function and compartment and the presence of more specific sequence features associated with the function. when tested on the ability to predict the function \"inhibits\", the function-trained predictor performs better than the compartment-trained predictor at low coverage . however, we have to be cautious in this region of the plot because of the small number of predictions used to calculate the accuracy. in figure <dig> the only predictor which has a gradually increasing accuracy curve is the one which is trained and tested on \"biosynthesis\" . this suggests that, with the current approach and dataset, \"cytoplasmic\" cannot really be predicted at all. we should stress, however, that the test set prediction accuracy for the \"biosynthesis\" predictor is poor . reasons for the comparatively poor performance of our approach have already been discussed. the key observation here is that there is a detectable seqeunce-to-function signal for proteins annotated with the word \"biosynthesis\", which is independent from the signals correlated to cytoplasmic localisation. sequence features the third approach is to look in more detail at the sequence features discovered/used by the predictors. the initial step in this analysis is to determine which are the positively and negatively influencing regular expressions in an evolved sequence_classifier subroutine. in some cases this would be easy to do by eye ), but often genetic programming produces complex expressions that are difficult to read and may behave in a non-linear fashion ), for example). as described in the methods, we estimate local derivatives for each of the regular expression terms in the evolved subroutine with respect to its output over the training set proteins. then all the evolved regular expressions belonging to a predictor are scanned against the test set sequences. each residue in the test set is initially assigned a zero score, but each time a regular expression matches a residue, its score is updated by a positive or negative amount . finally we extract the highest and lowest scoring sequence fragments from the sequences for further analysis. we should point out that the sequence feature analysis does no more than summarise the correlation of sequence features to annotations in the training data. we know that our algorithm overfits the data to some extent, therefore we checked all four cuts of the training/testing data for evidence of over-fitting. only the \"stable\" sequence features, discovered in all four training sets are presented below. the fixed-target predictors of \"nuclear\", \"transcription\" and \"dna\" annotations make use of an interesting repertoire of sequence features. as expected from our knowledge of nuclear import signals <cit> , all three predictor types look for tracts of lysine and/or arginine typically <dig> to <dig> residues in length. these k/r features seem to be most important for the \"dna\" predictor ), representing around 30% of the highest scoring sequence fragments. we also observe a dependence on tracts of negatively charged glutamate and aspartate residues for predictors of \"nuclear\" and \"dna\" ). acidic domains similar to this have been associated with protein-protein interactions in the nucleus <cit> , in addition to various non-nuclear roles <cit> . the most clear-cut distribution can be seen for polyglutamine-containing features. these are most important in the \"transcription\" predictor , moderately important in the \"nuclear\" predictor and not at all important for the \"dna\" predictor ). poly-q tracts are known to be involved in transcriptional activation . transcriptional activation domains are generally involved in stabilising/assembling the transcriptional machinery . the molecular details of polyq interactions are unclear, despite considerable interest in neurodegenerative diseases, such as huntington's disease, in which mutant polyq-expanded proteins are associated with late-onset neuronal death. closer manual inspection of the high scoring sequence fragments from the \"transcription\" predictor showed that the polyglutamine tract tends to be flanked by the following residues : d, r, h, a, n, k, s, l, e, p, t. the flanked polyglutamine feature is very strongly associated with the \"transcription\" predictor ). these flanking residues tend to have either small or charged sidechains, with the exception of leucine which is bulky and hydrophobic. the biological significance of the flanking amino acids is not yet clear. an interesting n-terminal sequence feature also appears to be important for just the \"nuclear\" and \"dna\" predictors ). this feature is characterised by a negatively charged amino acid following the n-terminal methionine. the predictors of \"secreted\", \"inhibits\" or \"antibacterial\" do not exhibit clear differences in terms of the positively influencing features. a possible positive feature associated with all three predictors is the presence of a cys, gly or pro and a lys or arg ; this feature constitutes 20% of the high scoring fragments . there are clear differences in the negatively influencing sequence features. lysine and glutamate have a strong negative influence on \"secreted\" predictors , but not on predictors for \"inhibits\". predictors for \"antibacterial\" show that glutamate and aspartate are negatively influencing , but there is no such role for lysine. negative sequence signals are difficult to explain, however, and are not discussed further. the sequence features having a positive influence on the predictors for \"cytoplasmic\", \"biosynthesis\" and \"catalyzes\" are summarised in figure <dig> no obvious alignable motif could be identified from the high-scoring fragments, but this was not expected because most protein families have distinct 3d structures and the active sites of enzymes tend to be formed from non-contiguous residues. however, short high-scoring fragments identified by the \"biosynthesis\" and \"catalyzes\" predictors typically contained one or more aromatic residue ). histidine is well known as an active site residue due to its ability to reversibly accept hydrogen ions and to coordinate with metal ions. phenylalanine and tryptophan have been shown to be important in maintaining the geometry of the active site through stacking interactions with other aromatic moieties, including catalytic histidines <cit> acidic residues , which are also well known to participate in catalysis, are important for all three predictor types, but most prominent in the \"cytoplasmic\" predictor. proline is linked to \"biosynthesis\" and \"catalyzes\", but is not well known as an active site constituent. in fact, according to the the imb jena image library site database <cit> , proline is ranked 19th out of the <dig> amino acids according to the number of times it occurs in active sites . interestingly however, proline ranks 7th according to its occurrence in the environment surrounding known active site residues . the general agreement between our sequence-based analysis and the structure-based survey leads us to suggest that proline has an important accessory role in maintaining the geometry of active sites. are sequence-to-function relationships discovered? we conclude that at least two functions, \"transcription\" and \"biosynthesis\", are associated with specific sequence features that are not simply a consequence of overlapping subcellular localisation. the most compelling evidence comes from the accuracy vs. coverage plots in figure <dig> where the training and testing targets were swapped, and figure <dig> where different contributing sequence features were found for each type of predictor. we draw further encouragement from the previously documented functions of some of the sequence features found automatically by our method . CONCLUSIONS existing function prediction methods are forced to take a simplified view of protein sequences, for example by considering amino acid composition, secondary structure predictions and the presence of known motifs. the preparation of input data for these methods is therefore heavily dependent on human knowledge and expertise. in this study we show how an open-ended evolutionary algorithm can automatically discover features in unprocessed amino acid sequences that correlate with protein function. our algorithm is also unique in the way it self-selects target functions while it learns these sequence features. the most complex feature discovered so far is the \"flanked polyglutamine tract\" associated with transcription, but many other features are much less specific, for example the \"containing proline\" feature associated with catalysis. our algorithm is designed so that every sequence-to-function predictor makes use of at least one sequence order-dependent feature. however, this feature can either be positively or negatively associated with the function, and may escape our attention if it is not clearly represented in the high scoring sequence fragments. sometimes the sequence order-dependent features are a consequence of overfitting to the training data. there is clearly room for improvement so that more numerous and higher quality sequence features can be discovered for a variety of functions. feature discovery is currently limited by two interrelated factors: the size of the non-redundant protein dataset and the completeness of their annotations. our dataset is relatively small because we have only accepted sequences with high-quality human annotations which contain at least one of the <dig> most frequent words. we could increase the amount of annotated training data by including homology-based electronic annotations, as used by both king et al. <cit> and jensen et al. <cit> . we also estimate that a less stringent sequence identity cutoff of 30% would increase the dataset size by around 25%, although at this level, some \"pollution\" by family-related functions would be introduced <cit> . however, in order to make the biggest impact on dataset size and quality one might use the gene ontology <cit> to describe protein function. firstly, the combined coverage manual and electronic go annotations is quite good . secondly, the hierarchical structure of go provides a more consistent description of protein structure at many different levels. the word-based approach we have used is easy to follow, but it is of course limited because words are often ambiguous out of context. in contrast, the go annotations benefit from the correct judgements of expert annotators. the free-text uniprot/swiss-prot annotations we used may have one advantage, however. they contain information about ligands, cofactors, modifications and interaction partners that is not available in go. for example, proteins targeted by ubiquitination may not be flagged as such in go, but these are certainly suitable targets for sequence feature discovery. further information about interaction partners could be drawn from databases such as kegg <cit> or the full-text literature. it is also interesting to look at the evolved annotation word combinations which define the target functions. in the original set of <dig> \"a-type\" predictors we saw <dig> instances of the combination \"nuclear or dna\" and <dig> instances of \"nuclear or rna\". the association of \"nuclear\" with \"dna\" and \"rna\" is perhaps not surprising. our algorithm has presumably learnt that if proteins are not annotated with the word \"nuclear\" then the word \"dna\" is also a good indication of nuclear localisation. likewise, most rna processing takes place in the nucleus. interestingly, \"ubiquitin\" also co-occurs with \"nuclear\" quite frequently . compared to the co-occurrence of these two terms in the training set annotations this seems quite high, and we suggest that from the sequence perspective there is a stronger functional linkage between the two terms than was previously known. recent experimental studies have indeed shown that ubiquitination has an important role in transcription <cit> . we have not presented a detailed analysis of the annotation word combinations because it is difficult to factor out the overfitting to the training data , and because we would need to run many more experiments to estimate the co-occurrence frequencies accurately. however, the rudimentary analysis presented above does clearly illustrate the knowledge discovery potential of our method. as discussed earlier, the low prediction accuracy of the evolved function predictors can be explained partly by the low-contrast training data we used. another equally plausible explanation is that there might not always be a simple one-to-one relationship between sequence features and annotated protein functions. however, given training data of sufficient quality and quantity, we believe that novel biology can be discovered from amino acid sequences with a method such as this. we do not doubt the importance of three-dimensional structure in protein function, rather we suggest that linear motifs and features may be responsible for more biology than is currently thought. parallels can be drawn with the recently discovered role of micrornas in gene regulation; it is reasonable to suggest that all biological systems have evolved to use low information content components wherever possible. our artificial evolutionary approach for sequence feature discovery is a kind of in silico combinatorial screening experiment. the current implementation is non-physical and is based on regular expression matching. although the evolution of the regular expressions is highly flexible, effective pattern discovery depends on the stepwise improvement and expansion of an initial simple pattern, with each step providing an increase in fitness. certain patterns may therefore not be reachable unless the representation is changed , larger populations are used, or some prior information is incorporated . these are therefore considerations for future work. finally, we briefly discuss a future application of self-supervised function predictors. our recent unpublished results show that the clustering of proteins using amino acid frequency vectors can be improved significantly by appending the binary outputs of <dig> different evolved function predictors to the vectors. most of the clusters obtained are enriched in one or more biological functions, therefore it is possible to assign/suggest functions for novel or uncharacterised proteins which fall into these clusters.",

RESULTS inps affect chlamydia development post entry in our previous study, we used the small molecule inp <dig> a derivative of salicylidene acylhydrazide identified as a specific inhibitor of y. pseudotuberculosis t3s. we found that inp <dig> progressively inhibited c. trachomatis l <dig> replication in doses from <dig> to <dig> μm <cit> . in the present study we included another derivative of salicylidene acylhydrazide, inp <dig> dose response studies on chlamydial inclusion size showed that inp <dig> was even more potent than inp <dig> in inhibiting c. trachomatis l <dig> replication, as <dig> μm inp <dig> was already sufficient to strongly inhibit bacterial multiplication . we also tested the effect of these two inps on the development of another strain of chlamydia, c. caviae gpic. at equivalent concentrations of inps, the effect on inclusion size was always more pronounced on c. trachomatis than on c. caviae inclusions, suggesting that the latter strain is less susceptible to the drug . treatment with <dig> μm inp <dig> resulted in a <dig> % reduction in the yield of infectious c. caviae eb particles. this reduction in infectivity is much greater than the decrease in inclusion size. it is consistent with the greater decrease in infectivity than inclusion size that we saw previously with inp <dig> on c. trachomatis l <dig> <cit> . in subsequent experiments we decided to use <dig> μm of inps, which fully inhibited development of c. trachomatis l <dig> and had a very strong effect on c. caviae multiplication. in order to quantify the efficiency of chlamydia entry in the presence of inps, hela cells were infected with c. trachomatis l <dig> or c. caviae gpic in the presence or absence of inp <dig> or inp <dig> at <dig> h p.i. extracellular and intracellular bacteria in mock-treated or <dig> μm inp-treated cultures were measured as previously described <cit> . the efficiency of entry was quantified. inps had no significant effect on c. trachomatis l <dig> and c. caviae gpic invasion, when present during infection . identical observations were made when the cells and/or the bacteria were preincubated for <dig> minutes in the presence of inps prior to infection or when bacteria were left to adhere on the cells at 4°c before allowing internalization to proceed at 37°c in the continuous presence of the drug . recruitment of actin and small gtpases to chlamydia entry sites during infection in the presence of inps although the overall efficiency of entry was not affected by inps over a <dig> h period of infection, a possibility remained that the bacteria used an alternative route of entry in the presence of the drug. to rule out this possibility, we observed some of the molecular events that accompany chlamydia entry. upon contact with host cells, chlamydia activate small gtpases and induce actin polymerization <cit> . these events are more pronounced in cells infected with c. caviae gpic <cit> than in cells infected with c. trachomatis l <dig> <cit> ; therefore we used the former. to synchronize infection, bacteria were centrifuged onto the cells and fixed <dig> minutes after contact. c. caviae gpic entry sites showed characteristic local actin rearrangements in control cells. similar actin aggregates were observed in cells treated with inp <dig> or inp <dig> . the number of actin aggregates per cell was identical in treated and untreated samples . the small gtpases rac, cdc <dig> and arf <dig> are recruited to the sites of c. caviae gpic entry, and their activity is needed for bacterial invasion <cit> . hela cells were transfected with either rac-gfp, cdc42-gfp or ha-tagged arf <dig> for <dig> h before being infected with c. caviae gpic. at <dig> minutes p.i. cells were fixed and labelled for actin. rac and cdc <dig> were localized by the gfp signal; arf <dig> was labelled with anti-ha antibodies. rac-gfp , arf <dig> and cdc42-gfp were found to be localized to the actin aggregates to the same extent in cells infected in the presence of inps as in control cells. therefore, inps do not interfere with the recruitment of small gtpases to c. caviae gpic entry sites, which strongly support the other observations that chlamydia entry proceeds normally in drug treated cells. discussion our data show that inps do not inhibit the entry of chlamydia into host cells. the efficiency of bacterial invasion has been investigated with two chlamydia species, c. trachomatis l <dig> and c. caviae gpic, and it was not modified in the presence of the drug. the normal recruitment of rac, cdc <dig> and arf <dig> to c. caviae gpic entry sites in the presence of inps further indicates that inps do not interfere with the mechanism of chlamydia invasion. previously, we had reported a partial effect on chlamydia trachomatis l <dig> entry in the presence of inp <dig> <cit> . this was based on the observation that treatment of the cells with <dig> μm inp <dig> for the first <dig> hours of infection, resulted in a 40% reduction in the percentage of infected cells, compared to non-treated cells. we interpreted these data as a partial effect of the drug on bacterial entry. however, since we demonstrate here that chlamydia invasion is not impaired by treatment with inps, a more likely explanation is that other early events, following chlamydia entry, are required for the onset of infection and are susceptible to the drugs. indeed, chlamydia genes expressed early in infection are needed to create a permissive environment for successful bacterial replication <cit> . in particular, some of the inc proteins, which are t3s substrates, are transcribed very early during infection and can be detected in the inclusion as early as 2– <dig> h p.i. <cit> . in support of our results, wolf et al. and slepenkin et al. had reported that they were unable to inhibit c. trachomatis l <dig> entry in presence of inps <cit> . in the study of wolf et al. the effect of drug on the eb translocated protein tarp, which probably plays a central role in the internalization process of c. trachomatis was examined. upon host cell attachment, tarp is secreted in a type iii dependent manner by chlamydia trachomatis and becomes rapidly phosphorylated. wolf et al., were unable to inhibit this early tyrosine phosphorylation of tarp in cells treated with another compound of the same family of inps <cit> . the lack of effect of inps, which have been identified and described as type iii secretion inhibitors, on chlamydia entry is therefore surprising. recent reports on the mode of action of inps which we would like to discuss here, raise the question whether these drugs interfere with the actual translocation process of t3s substrates or rather inhibit at the level of transcription of t3s associated genes or assembly of the t3s machinery. earlier studies suggested that inps might affect the translocation of type iii substrates per se, and indeed, in yersinia, careful analyses suggest that it is the case <cit> . so far, the efficiency of inps at blocking t3s in chlamydia has been shown only for substrates secreted by rbs, and their target might be missing in ebs. in favour of this hypothesis is the observation that chlamydiae genomes encode two homologues for the yersinia lcrh chaperone for t3s system structural components, lcrh- <dig> and lcrh- <dig> <cit> . these genes are in clusters that are differentially expressed during the developmental cycle. it was recently shown that transcription of lcrh- <dig> which is expressed late in the cycle, when ebs are forming, was inhibited by inp <dig> while transcription of lcrh- <dig> which is expressed earlier in the cycle, was not <cit> . functional differences in the t3s apparatuses of ebs and rbs might therefore explain a difference in sensitivity to the type iii secretion inhibitors. this would be consistent with our results and could explain the lack of effect of inps on chlamydia entry. as an alternative, it is possible that inps have a different mode of action on chlamydia development than they have on yersinia, and do not block the translocation of effectors per se. importantly, the effect of inps on chlamydial development is fully reversed by the addition of iron <cit> , while their inhibitory effect on yersinia t3s is not . in this case, inps might affect one of two requirements for effector protein secretion: the assembly of functional secretion apparatuses or the synthesis of the substrates recognized by the secretion machinery. by acting on the formation of type iii secretion apparatuses, inps would only be effective when introduced while the apparatuses are being made, i.e. in the intracellular multiplication phase of chlamydia development. in support of this hypothesis, recent data strongly suggest that, in the case of shigella, inps block assembly of the type iii secreton <cit> . in shigella, inps were only effective at inhibiting host cell invasion when added during growth, rather than during the infection step. if, on the other hand, inps inhibited the synthesis of type iii secretion substrates, they would not affect entry either, because the effectors needed for this step are not newly synthesized during entry. inp <dig> has been shown to inhibit the secretion of inca and incg proteins, which are produced during rb proliferation, and are rapidly translocated upon synthesis, as they are only weakly detected in rbs <cit> . in contrast, tarp and other potential t3s effectors participating in the entry event are at least partially stored in the rbs to be released by the eb form upon infection. recent data show that the expression of some of the t3s genes is down-regulated by inp <dig> <cit> . similarly, the yersinia t3s system is down-regulated upon bacterial exposure to inps <cit> and it has also been shown in salmonella that these compounds cause transcriptional silencing of the salmonella pathogenicity island <dig> <cit> . it should be noted that if inps act at a transcriptional level in chlamydia, they might not affect the secretion of all effectors to the same extent. therefore, at this stage inps should only be used cautiously to assess the mechanism of secretion of a given chlamydial protein. down-regulation of transcription could perhaps also be due to feedback inhibition resulting from blocking t3s activity <cit> . if, in chlamydia, either the transcription of t3s associated genes or the assembly of the t3s machinery are inhibited, addition of the drugs at the end of one cycle of infection is expected to affect the next round of infection. this is exactly what was observed when looking at the progeny of c. trachomatis infected cells treated with inp <dig> <dig> hours post infection <cit> . in this experiment, although the inclusions formed upon late inp <dig> treatment were as abundant as in control cells, there was a decrease in the infectious progeny, suggesting that ebs formed in the presence of inps might be defective in their ability to secrete type iii effectors. however, due to the asynchronicity of the chlamydia developmental cycle, we can not definitively rule out that the decrease in the formation of infectious ebs when the drug is added late in the cycle is not due to the now well documented reduction of rb multiplication upon inp treatment. CONCLUSIONS in the present study we demonstrate that small molecule inhibitors of yersinia t3s have a strong inhibitory effect on chlamydia growth but fail to inhibit chlamydia invasion. inps had no significant effect on c. trachomatis l <dig> and c. caviae gpic entry into epithelial cells. moreover, recruitment of actin and small gtpases to bacterial entry sites was not altered. these results suggest that in the presence of inps pivotal events in early chlamydia biogenesis following entry must be affected which could account for the observed inhibition of chlamydia growth. the inability of inps to interfere with the entry mechanism suggest that the drug might not affect the translocation process per se. we believe that the identification of the mode of action of inps on type iii secretion in genetically tractable bacteria will clarify this issue.",

    "prompt": "Offer a summary of the most critical clinical findings. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND cotton is one of the most important economic crops in the world. male sterility is a simple and efficient pollination control system that has been widely used in hybrid cotton breeding. in cotton breeding, two major male sterile systems are used to produce hybrid seeds, namely cytoplasmic male sterility and genetic male sterility . both systems have a maternally or nuclear inherited trait that renders them inability to produce or release functional pollen, so they can be used as maternal plants to produce hybrid seeds. the molecular mechanism of male sterility is currently a research hotspot in plant science. many studies have demonstrated that cms is often associated with unusual open reading frames found in mitochondrial genomes. for example, accumulation of the cytotoxic peptide orf <dig> in boro-taichung -type cytoplasmic male sterile rice with chinsurah boro ii cytoplasm causes cms. the orf <dig> protein is expressed by a dicistronic gene, atp6-orf <dig> which exists in addition to the normal atp <dig> gene in the bt-type mitochondrial genome <cit> . nuclear-encoded-fertility restorer genes can suppress cms-inducing orfs and restore male fertility <cit> . gms has been also extensively studied at the gene and protein expression levels with an exclusive focus on protein coding genes. up to now, very few studies have been on the relationship between male sterility and protein non-coding genes. as a class of non-coding genes, small non-coding rnas play an essential role in regulating the molecular machinery of eukaryotic cells by controlling transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms <cit> . these processes include chromatin formation and maintenance, defense against selfish and parasitic entities such as transposable elements and viruses, as well as native protein coding gene expression <cit> . regulatory ncrna in plants can be divided into two primary categories, i.e., micrornas and short interfering rnas . while sirnas result primarily from exogenous sources, mirnas are a class of endogenous small regulatory ncrnas with lengths ranging from 20– <dig> nucleotides that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through perfect or near-perfect complementarity with target mrnas for cleavage or inhibition of translation <cit> . some known mirna loci form clusters in the genome and these mirna clusters are probably produced by gene duplication and the mirnas in a given cluster are often related to one another <cit> . mirnas are key post transcriptional regulators that control various biological and metabolic processes in eukaryotes, many of which are conserved and have more recently evolved species-specific diversity <cit> . mirnas also have important regulatory functions in specific biological processes during the life cycle of plants, such as controlling tissue differentiation and development, the phase switch from vegetative to reproductive growth, and responses to different biotic and abiotic stresses <cit> . a growing number of new plant mirnas have been identified in recent years. to date, more than <dig> mirnas have been annotated in arabidopsis, rice, and other plant species <cit> . however, the number of mirnas in plants is apparently not saturated because new mirnas are continually identified in different species. in upland cotton , only <dig> mirnas have been reported. anthers are highly specialized organs for nutrient storage and reproductive development. their maturation and development involves meticulous gene regulation at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels <cit> . in anthers, small ncrnas are essential for sporophyte development in the somatic diploid phase of flowering plants and small rna pathways are present and functional in angiosperm male gametophytes <cit> . in arabidopsis, over-expression of mir <dig> leads to male sterility <cit> . even though there is no direct evidence that any mirnas are causative genes for male sterility in plants, we hypothesize that differential expression of some mirna genes are involved in regulation of male sterility. as the first step towards the understanding of their regulatory mechanisms and networks of target genes in male sterility in plants, expression of mirnas between a cotton gms mutant and its fertile wild type was compared using a deep sequencing approach developed by solexa in the present study. the male sterility of the gms mutant ‘dong a’ is controlled by one pair of recessive genes <cit> , and it has the same genetic background with its wild type . therefore, they are ideal genetic materials for studying cotton anther development and male sterility. in the present work, the expression patterns of mirnas and the critical small rna pathways of the gms ‘dong a’ and its wt were analyzed and compared at three different stages of male gametophyte development, followed by an integrated bioinformatics analysis to identify novel and candidate mirnas. furthermore, the expression profiles of mirnas were analyzed by mirna clustering, which has been widely used to study mirna expression levels in various species <cit> . by further comparing the expression patterns between selected mirnas and their corresponding target genes, we have gained a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of mirnas in anther development and genetic male sterility of cotton. RESULTS phenotypic analysis of impaired anthers in the cotton male-sterile mutant to determine the morphological defects of the cotton gms mutant, we compared the anthers of the mutant and its fertile wild type . at <dig> day post anthesis , the mutant showed an abnormal floral phenotype with no pollen grains and smaller anthers than the wt . the pollen grains in the wt and the mutant were stained with 2% i2-ki to detect starch activity during the flowering period. there were many viable pollen grains in the wt, while there was no viable pollen in the mutant observed . therefore, the mutant is completely sterile. distribution of small rnas during cotton anther development based on previous studies that the peak of male sterility mainly occurs in the uninucleate microspore stage of anthers in ‘dong a’ gms mutant <cit> , early anther development stages were chosen to identify possible mirnas that may be involved in events leading to male sterility. in this study, anthers were selected from two earlier stages, i.e., meiosis stage and tetrad stage , together with the uninucleate microspore stage from the gms ‘dong a’ mutant and its fertile wild type to construct six small rna libraries . the datasets from the six libraries were used to query the ncrna sequences deposited in the national center for biotechnology information gene bank and the rfam <dig> database to separate the small rnas that matched non-coding sequences, such as ribosomal rna , transfer rna , small nuclear rna , and small nucleolar rna . the distribution of these fragments is listed in table <dig> almost <dig> million small rna sequences with lengths ranging from 18– <dig> nt were obtained in these six small rna libraries. the majority of the small rnas in both the wt and mutant libraries were 21– <dig> nt , which is within the typical size range for dicer-derived products and in agreement with most previously reported results. of these, <dig> nt small rnas were the most abundant. variations in small rna expression in the wt and gms mutant during anther development the total numbers of mirnas and sirnas in the three wt libraries were greater than those of the three corresponding gms mutant libraries . the number of unique mirnas in the three wt libraries was different from that in the three gms mutant libraries. moreover, the number of unique mirnas in the mar-f- <dig> library was twice that of the mar-s- <dig> library and the number of unique sirnas in the mar-f- <dig> library was also significantly greater than that in the mar-s- <dig> library . analyzing mirna variations in the three anther developmental stages between the wt and its gms mutant, we found that the mar-s- <dig> and the mar-f- <dig> libraries comprised <dig> % and <dig> % of the unique mirnas, respectively; the mar-s- <dig> and the mar-f- <dig> libraries comprised <dig> % and <dig> %, respectively; and the mar-s- <dig> and the mar-f- <dig> libraries comprised <dig> % and <dig> %, respectively. only <dig> %, <dig> % and <dig> % of the unique mirnas were shared between the wt and its gms mutant during the same three anther developmental stages, respectively . therefore, most of the unique mirnas found in the gms mutant anthers were different from those in the wt anthers at the corresponding stage. the above results indicated that various small rna regulations were already present during the anther development of the ‘dong a’ gms mutant, as compared to its fertile wild type. these different small rna varieties and diverse small rna regulations may target different genes that influence the anther development and therefore male sterility. identification of conserved cotton mirnas aligning the small rna sequences to known cotton mirnas resulted in <dig> and <dig> matches for the mar-f- <dig> and mar-s- <dig> libraries, respectively. in the mar-f- <dig> and mar-s- <dig> libraries, there were <dig> and <dig> matches for the wt and the mutant, respectively. in the mar-f- <dig> and mar-s- <dig> libraries, there were <dig> , <dig> and <dig> matches for the wt and the mutant, respectively . sixteen conserved cotton mirna families comprising <dig> , <dig> individual candidate mirna reads were identified in the six small rna libraries, with the gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> families being the most abundant, followed by the gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> families . of all the conserved cotton mirna reads, gh-mir <dig> dominated the wt and the mutant libraries, accounting for <dig> % and <dig> % , respectively . next is gh-mir <dig> which accounted for <dig> % and <dig> % in the wt and mutant libraries, respectively. in contrast, some other mirna families showed very low expression abundance in the anthers, with very lower read counts. the varied abundance of these mirna families suggests that the mirna genes are differentially transcribed during anther development. analyzing mirna expression between wt and its gms mutant anthers revealed that gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> were differentially expressed during the meiosis stage, three of which were also differentially expressed during the tetrad stage and two of which together with gh-mir <dig> were differentially expressed during the uninucleate microspore stage . thus, gh-mir <dig> was in common in all the three stages and gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> were each differentially expressed between the ‘dong a’ wt and the gms mutant during two anther developmental stages. degradome library construction and validation of conserved mirna targets in cotton, conserved mirna targets were previously identified mainly via bioinformatics prediction <cit> and only a few conserved mirna targets have been experimentally validated <cit> . in this study, in order to identify mirna targets, a degradome library derived from anthers of the wt and gms mutant representing three stages of development was constructed and sequenced, resulting in the generation of <dig> million raw reads. after removal of low quality sequences and adapter sequences, <dig> million clean reads were obtained and 98% were <dig> or <dig> nt in length as expected in that normally length distribution peak of degradome fragment is between <dig> and <dig> nt <cit> . of unique signatures, <dig> million distinct reads of <dig> and <dig> nt in length were obtained and <dig> million signatures were perfectly mapped to reference sequences in the cotton transcript assemblies database , which represented <dig> % of the annotated unique cotton sequences. these data indicate that the degradome library was of high quality with good genome coverage in identifying degraded mrna targets that should contain the sequence profile resulting from mirna directed cleavage. by sequence alignments, a total of <dig> distinct transcripts targeted by <dig> unique mirnas were detected in our degradome library . gene ontology categories based on biological processes revealed that these mirna-target genes were related to <dig> biological processes ; the five most frequent terms are regulation of cellular process, metabolic process, response to stimulus, macromolecule metabolic process, and primary metabolic process, indicating the importance of these mirnas in gene regulations during cotton anther development. as shown above, many targets of conserved mirnas were captured by the degradome analysis, which provided experimental evidence to support previous predictions. the results of degradome analysis revealed that gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> directed cleavages of sbp-box , class iii hd-zip like protein , auxin response factor <dig> , ap <dig> , acc oxidase <dig> , and cu/zn superoxide dismutase genes, respectively, which are key genes involved in hormone signals, cell patterning, and anti-oxidant metabolism. these identified mirna targets using degradome sequencing are present in the form of target plots that plot the abundance of the signatures relative to their position in the transcripts <cit> . in each of these t-plots, a clear peak for the absolute number of tags is found at the predicted cleavage site for gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> or gh-mir <dig> , indicated that there are correspondences between the cleavage positions and significant sites on the t-plots. validation of mirna and target expression through taqman microrna assays to examine mirna expression during three stages of anther development as well as validate the sequencing results, gh-mir156a, gh-mir166a, gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> gh-mir396a and gh-mir <dig> were assayed to validate if these mirnas had significant differences in expressions between the wt and gms mutant anthers . the mirna expression patterns were similar to the sequencing results, indicating that the small rna sequencing results were reliable. to test if any correlation between mirnas and their targets existed, the expression patterns of identified mirna targets based on quantitative rt-pcr were compared . if a mirna degraded its target mrna transcripts, their expression levels could be negatively correlated. as expected, the expression levels of most mirna were inversely correlated with these of the corresponding mrnas. during the three anther developmental stages, gh-mir <dig> expressed at a relatively higher level in the gms mutant than in the wt, while its target gene encoding a sbp-box expressed in the reverse way, as expected . unexpectedly, as compared with the gms mutant, this target gene expressed at a proportionally higher level at the uninucleate stage of the wt anthers, during which stage the gh-mir <dig> level was relatively lower . the relationship between gh-mir <dig> and its target encoding an auxin response factor 4and between gh-mir <dig> and its target encoding cu/zn superoxide dismutase followed a similar trend in the first and third stages . as compared with the wt, the gms mutant anthers had higher expression levels of the two mirnas and lower expression of their target genes at the meiosis and uninucleate stages. on the contrary, the gms mutant anthers at the tetrad stage had similar or lower expression levels of the mirnas, but their target genes had significantly higher expression levels, as compared with the wt . similarly to gh-mir <dig> gh-mir <dig> was up-regulated in the uninucleate microspore stage of the gms mutant anthers as compared with the wt, while its target gene encoding for arf <dig> expressed at a much lower level . a reverse trend was noted between gh-mir <dig> and its target gene coding for class iii hd-zip like protein and between gh-mir <dig> and its target gene coding for ap <dig> in the gms mutant as compared to the wt. the expression levels of gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> in the gms mutant were significantly lower than in the wt during the three stages of the anther development, while the reverse was true for their target genes . it should be pointed out that, the negative correlation in expression levels between mirnas and their target genes existed except for gh-mir <dig> but the linear correlation coefficients were not statistically significant due in part to only three anther developmental stages sampled. the non-linear relationship of expression levels between mirnas and their target genes may also indicate that there are other mechanisms regulating expression of the target genes. analysis of novel mirna candidates given the fact that the sequencing of the upland cotton genome is incomplete, and information on genomewide cotton small rna population is unknown, accurate identification of non-conserved mirna in cotton is a difficult task. following a blastn search and hairpin structure prediction , <dig> putative unique g. hirsutum mirnas were detected in the six small rna libraries , including <dig> in the mar-f- <dig> library, <dig> in the mar-f- <dig> library, <dig> in the mar-f- <dig> library, <dig> in the mar-s- <dig> library, <dig> in the mar-s- <dig> library, and <dig> in the mar-s- <dig> library . all of these newly identified mirnas met the criteria for mirna annotation <cit> . comparing the expression of these novel mirnas between wt and gms mutant anthers, <dig> <dig> and <dig> novel mirnas were significantly differentially expressed in the meiosis, the tetrad and the uninucleate microspore stages, respectively . identification of target genes for these novel mirnas suggests that they may participate in various aspects of anther development. for example, novel mirna mar-f-1-m <dig> was identified to target gene encoding a transport inhibitor response <dig> , which can directly bind to auxin through the formation of the scftir <dig> complex and is the key protein in the aux/iaa degradation pathway of the 26s proteasome <cit> . discussion small rnas regulate many aspects of anther development. however, no existing studies have reported the relationship between mirnas and male sterility in cotton. to understand the underlying molecular basis resulting in the male sterility of the cotton gms mutant, six small rna libraries were constructed during the anther development of ‘dong a’ wt and its gms mutant in the current work. to the best of our knowledge, the present study represents one of the first such attempts. millions of unique small rna sequences of 18– <dig> nt in length were detected, including <dig> novel mirnas, thus enriching the number of known unique small rnas in cotton. sixteen conserved mirna families were detected in this study. many canonical mirnas are conserved among mosses, eudicots, and monocots, and some have conserved functions among land plants <cit> . for example, the mature canonical gh-mir <dig> in cotton is identical to those in poplar and arabidopsis. these conserved mirnas may play an important role in cotton anther development, as many of their targets mediate biological pathways, such as auxin responses and cell patterning, as implicated in the regulation of anther development, based on previous studies <cit> . both gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> were predominantly expressed during anther development in ‘dong a’ wt and its gms mutant , an indication of important roles in regulating cotton anther development. in this study, gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> were identified to target arf <dig> and class iii hd-zip like protein, respectively. as compared with the wild type, gh-mir <dig> was expressed at a relatively higher level in the uninucleate microspore stage, which led to down-regulation of arf <dig> by ten-fold in the gms mutant anthers . the much lower expression level of arf <dig> may affect the auxin response pathway in the gms mutant, which was consistent with the lower content of iaa in the uninucleate microspore stage of the gms mutant anthers . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> is thought to target mrnas that encode a class iii hd-zip-like protein that plays a critical role in shoot apical meristem initiation and leaf polarity and pattern formation <cit> . however, the relationship between male sterility and the lower level of gh-mir <dig> in the gms mutant anthers relative to wt anthers is currently unknown and needs further studies. mir <dig> and mir <dig> target squamosa promoter binding protein transcription factors and apetala <dig> , respectively, which have been predicted to play important roles in anther development <cit> . mir <dig> directly represses the expression of sbp-box transcription factors that play an important role in juvenile-to-adult transition throughout the plant kingdom <cit> . it has been shown that mir <dig> directly promotes the transcription of mir <dig> via sbp-box, and mir <dig> acts downstream of mir <dig> to promote adult epidermal identity <cit> . furthermore, the mir156-regulated sbp-box is a direct upstream activator of leafy, fruitfull, and apetala <dig> <cit> . in this study, gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> were moderately expressed in ‘dong a’ wt and its gms mutant . compared to these of the wt, the anthers from the three anther developmental stages of the gms mutant had higher expression levels of gh-mir <dig> and lower expression of its target sbp-box. in contrast to the fact that over-expression of mir <dig> resulted in male sterility in arabidopsis and rice <cit> , we detected lower level of expression of gh-mir <dig> and higher level of expression of its target ap <dig> in the gms mutant anthers at the three anther developmental stages . therefore, the relationship between mir156/mir <dig> and male sterility in the gms mutant is likely different and needs further studies. gh-mir <dig> was identified to target acc oxidase <dig> , a key branch-point enzyme involved in ethylene biosynthetic process <cit> . in anther development, ethylene is important for male gametophyte germination and anther dehiscence <cit> and it has been reported that fertile male gametophyte development is accompanied by two peaks of ethylene production in anther tissues and the mature pollen is characterized by a high content of ethylene <cit> . in the current study, gh-mir <dig> was differentially expressed between ‘dong a’ wt and its gms mutant anthers in the meiosis stage, and it had a higher level of expression in the gms mutant anthers in the uninucleate microspore stage. this is consistent with the relatively lower level of expression of its target gene acc oxidase <dig> . however, whether the opposite expressions of gh-mir <dig> and its target gene in the gms mutant anthers leading to a significant reduction in ethylene synthesis remains to be studied. gh-mir <dig> targets mrna that encodes cu/zn superoxide dismutase , which plays an important role in plant antioxidant metabolism <cit> . in plants, the prominent role of reactive oxygen species has been revealed in induction, signaling, and execution of programmed cell death <cit> . ros can trigger release of cytochrome c, which is a ros-derived pcd feature shared among mammalian, plant and yeast mitochondria <cit> . previous studies revealed that excessive accumulation of o2- <dig> and h2o <dig> and a significant reduction in ros-scavenging enzyme activity coincide with male cell death in cytoplasmic male sterile of cotton <cit> . budar and pelletier reasoned that the difference in sod gene expression between the cotton male sterile line and its maintainer may result in an imbalance in ros metabolism and male sterility <cit> . in the present study, we showed the existence of different underlying mirna pathways that may regulate enzymatic activities in the wt and its gms mutant. surprisingly, gh-mirna <dig> was up-regulated by twenty-fold and its target gene cu/zn sod was reversely much lower expressed in the uninucleate microspore stage of gms mutant anthers, as compared to the wt anthers . up-regulation of cytochrome c by threefold was observed in the corresponding stage of the gms mutant anthers . the decreased cu/zn sod activity and elevated expression level of cytochrome c in the gms mutant anthers may lead to a transient oxidative burst and significant ros accumulation. however, more studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to male sterility in the gms mutant. CONCLUSIONS using a deep sequencing strategy, a number of mirnas expressed during three anther development stages of cotton were identified. the differential expression of the mirnas between the gms mutant and its wt indicates that mirnas are distinctly involved in cotton anther development and male sterility. further studies of these differentially expressed mirnas and their targets in the anthers will provide a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying male sterility in cotton.",

    "prompt": "Write a brief summary of the study design and endpoints. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND co-conservation, a measure of the degree to which proteins are gained and lost together through evolution , has demonstrated utility as a protein function prediction method <cit> , particularly in bacteria. pairwise co-conservation scores can be aggregated into networks <cit> , and assessments of connectivity within the resulting graph can further improve the quality of function prediction. function prediction methods based on biological networks is an active area of research <cit> . topological analysis of other types of biological networks, including protein-protein interactions, regulatory interactions, and metabolic networks, has demonstrated that structural features of network subgraphs can provide quantitative insight into biological function <cit> . for example, maslov and sneppen analyzed the stability of interaction networks by comparing patterns in average connectivity of interaction and regulatory networks <cit> . characterizations of the structural features of metabolite networks <cit> demonstrate a correlation between topologically defined subnetworks and biochemical function. topological characterizations also illuminate evolutionary issues. for example, fraser et al. observed that the effect of an individual protein on cell fitness correlates with the number of its interaction partners <cit> . jeong et al. showed that most highly connected proteins in protein-protein interaction networks are crucial to cell viability <cit> . due to the availability of genome-wide data, nearly all previous investigations of network topology have been in yeast, and the majority has been based on high-throughput assays of protein-protein interactions . in contrast, this paper examines co-conservation networks in bacteria using different reference genomes, the first in-depth study to our knowledge, of the topological characteristics of such networks. this characterization can be used for current and future comparison to like studies in other organism and network types. co-conservation networks are distinct from physical interaction networks as they capture putative functional relationships which are not necessarily dependent on direct protein binding. we find that bacterial co-conservation networks show both biologically important similarities and differences with yeast ppi networks. for example, similar to reports of significance in yeast ppi networks <cit> , node degree in bacterial co-conservation networks is predictive of broad functional categories, such as essentiality. unlike yeast ppi networks <cit> , the bacterial co-conservation network using all bacteria as the reference set does not demonstrate high connectivity among proteins that form complexes. such differences call into question the broad applicability of the yeast methods for predicting function based on network topology. here, the topological properties of bacterial co-conservation networks and their relationship to function are examined. based on this assessment, we demonstrate the use of co-conservation network topological properties to predict the function of uncharacterized proteins. RESULTS the bacterial co-conservation network constructed from e. coli k <dig> and <dig> other completely sequenced bacteria is shown in figure 1a. this network captures, for each e. coli k <dig> protein, which other proteins it is co-conserved with in a large reference group. we have previously described how such interaction networks can vary with the selection of reference group <cit> and that networks conserved across multiple species can provide insight into the function of proteins that act in coherent biological processes <cit> . here, we assessed the topological characteristics of bacterial co-conservation networks for the purpose of using such characteristics to improve protein function prediction. though most results are reported using the all genomes reference set, we also provide comparison to using motile, proteobacteria and aerobic reference sets. topological features of e. coli k <dig> networks the e. coli k <dig> co-conservation network using all genomes as reference contained <dig> interactions, among <dig> proteins, forming <dig> disconnected subgraphs, called clusters . the remaining <dig> e. coli k <dig> proteins were not co-conserved with any others, and would be singletons if they had been included in the graph. three large clusters were apparent, containing <dig> proteins , <dig> proteins and <dig> proteins . surprisingly, networks constructed from the other reference sets contained roughly the same number of proteins as the all network, yet the number of interactions varied widely . the clustering coefficient was defined as the edge density in the neighbors of a protein. the average clustering coefficient of the all network was high , indicating that proteins tend to be co-conserved in highly connected groups. the average shortest path indicated that there was a short path between any two proteins in a cluster. the average clustering coefficient remained high for motile, proteobacteria, and aerobic networks. though the connectivity average increased as the number of interactions increased, the average shortest path appeared to be large in the motile network, relative to the others. moreover, the diameter of the motile network was disproportionately large. this occurred because the motile network consisted of two large densely connected clusters bridged by only a few edges and there existed many smaller clusters extending by long paths from the two dense cores . the connectivity distribution p, the probability that a protein interacts with k other proteins, shown in figure 1b for the all network, had a heterogeneous, skewed shape, and indicated that most proteins were linked to only a few proteins, but a few proteins had a large number of connections. p in this graph was consistent with a power law distribution p ~ k-γ, with γ = <dig> , indicating a scale free network. in the log-log plot of figure 1c, there was a high correlation between connectivity and connectivity distribution ) for a large range of k. however the correlation broke down for highly connected nodes. topological analysis is summarized in table <dig> using different reference sets. like many other biological networks <cit> , the bacterial co-conservation networks using difference reference sets were all scale-free . hubs in scale free networks distinguish essentiality and complexes scale-free networks share a number of properties, including sensitivity to disruptions of highly connected \"hub\" nodes and robustness to interference with non-hub nodes, among others. therefore, this result suggests that the collection of hub nodes in bacterial co-conservation networks should include a higher proportion of essential proteins than the collection of non-hub nodes. indeed, essential proteins in our bacterial co-conservation network had significantly more interactions than non-essential proteins , validating earlier findings in yeast using other types of interactions <cit> . for example, the average degree of essential proteins in the all network was <dig> , while that of non-essential proteins was <dig> . note that the disparity of mean connectivity between essential and non-essential proteins suggests that connectivity alone can be used as a proxy for essentiality. in the proteobacteria network, the essentiality is not predictable . in that essentiality is not evenly distributed among functional categories, these results suggest that connectivity, and possibly other measures of network topology, might also be useful for improving function prediction. unlike yeast ppi networks <cit> , high connectivity in bacteria co-conservation networks does not allow identification of protein complexes. we noted that when the reference genome was all, there was no significant difference between the connectivity of complex proteins vs. non-complex proteins . the small difference between mean connectivity in the aerobic network is statistically significant due to low overall standard deviation of connectivity . interestingly, high connectivity in the motile and proteobacteria networks corresponds to non-complex proteins. this is in contrast to yeast ppi networks where high connectivity corresponds to protein complexes. relationship between protein-protein interaction and co-conservation networks the co-conservation network was compared to the e. coli k <dig> protein-protein interaction network, obtained from the database of interacting proteins <cit> , which contained <dig> interactions over <dig> proteins. the ppi network had no interactions for <dig> proteins that had at least one interaction in the co-conservation network . of these <dig> proteins in the co-conservation network, <dig> were unclassified using kegg , <dig> were unclassified using cog and <dig> were unclassified using tigr . these proteins represent examples where the co-conservation network allowed the assignment of function to proteins which could not be annotated using the ppi network. relationships among topological characteristics and protein function function annotation homogeneity within clusters the co-conservation protein clusters in the all network ranged in size from <dig> to <dig> proteins. considering clusters with at least two annotated proteins, the proteins in all but the largest clusters tended to have identical function annotations, regardless of the source of annotation . for clusters of size less than <dig> the majority are homogeneous for all different sources. though some medium and large clusters contained proteins with different function annotations, these proteins are often involved in inter-dependent processes that contribute to a common phenomenon <cit> . for example, many clusters contain proteins annotated to some specific function and also to \"regulation,\" where the regulation activity turns out to be regulating the process in which the other proteins participate. the proteins that underlie a function and its regulation were co-conserved. this was not an indication of functional heterogeneity, but was an artifact of the annotation scheme. function and connectivity different functional classes displayed different average connectivity . since the definition of a functional class varied among different annotation databases, figure <dig> shows the connectivity of each protein versus kegg <cit> , cog <cit> , and tigr <cit> functional categories. for kegg and cog, regardless of the reference set, proteins with high connectivity were generally involved in cellular processes , which was interesting given that there were few cellular process proteins in each network. in contrast, metabolism proteins were abundant and generally had the lowest average connectivity. using cog, cell division and chromosome partitioning in figure <dig> had high average connectivity using all reference sets except aerobic. in the proteobacteria network, the most highly connected protein were intracellular trafficking and secretion while the most highly connected proteins in the aerobic network were motility proteins . tigr classification showed proteins involved in motility had high average connectivity, while central intermediary metabolism and cofactors were the least connected . translation is one of the most ancient processes in the cell and previous studies have shown that these proteins have a high average connectivity <cit> . the average connectivity of these nodes in our networks was low ; this was because most of these proteins appeared in more than 90% of organisms and were removed in the preprocessing step as described in the methods section. additional file <dig> <dig> <dig> show the presence of high connectivity among these proteins in networks when proteins that appear in more than 90% or less than 10% of the genomes in a reference set were not removed. interestingly, przulj et al. have earlier observed that in the yeast protein-protein interaction network, stress and defense and transport proteins are less connected than transcription and translation proteins <cit> . though the annotation sources for e. coli are completely different, the average connectivity in tigr for transporter and transcription were similar . it is interesting that dna metabolism is most connected in all, followed by dna/protein/amino acid in motile, followed by protein in proetobacteria, and finally amino acid in aerobic. function and hub proteins power law networks have a few nodes with many connections while the majority of nodes have few links. the nodes with many connections are shown to be particularly interesting in a biological context as they can have important roles for drug targets and are crucial in cell viability, among other traits <cit> . intriguingly, in the all network, many of the hubs had no functional classification in any annotation source . maslov and sneppen argue that hub proteins tend not to interact with other hub proteins in yeast, but rather prefer to interact with sparsely connected proteins <cit> . this assertion was not true in the bacterial co-conservation networks. in bacterial co-conservation networks, hubs tended to interact with other hubs. for example in the all network, of <dig> interactions where at least one partner was a hub, only 24% were between a hub and a non-hub while 76% were between two hubs. hubs were defined as the top 10% of highly connected proteins; the same pattern holds when the hubs were defined to be the top 20% of highly connected proteins . for hubs defined as the top 10%, hub-hub connectivity was high in the motile , proteobacteria and aerobic networks. although beyond the scope of this work, it would be interesting to better understand why bacterial hub nodes are highly interconnected and what effect on network properties such interconnectedness confers. our interest is how connectivity information improves function prediction. using topological features to assign function to uncharacterized proteins based on the above observations, we hypothesized that specific aspects of network topology could be used to improve function prediction of uncharacterized proteins. a popular approach to function prediction is to use the most frequently occurring function among the neighbors of an uncharacterized protein <cit> . one problem with this approach is that many neighbors of unclassified proteins tend to also be unclassified. for example, combining functional information from kegg <cit> , cog <cit> and tigr <cit> , 41% of the total number of interactions contained at least one unclassified protein in the all network. in 67% of the <dig> interactions, one partner was unclassified , while in the remaining 33% both proteins in the pair were unclassified . importantly, the majority of neighbors of the unclassified proteins were also unclassified using kegg. based on our observations regarding the topology of the co-conservation network described above, we hypothesized that extending the function prediction strategy to include the majority function assignment of a cluster, rather than just the neighbors of a protein, would improve prediction. the accuracy of this prediction strategy was validated by determining the average percentage of proteins which were assigned the majority function within their cluster. the percentage value that defines the majority was calculated for each cluster and averaged over all clusters that had at least three proteins and at least two were classified. on average, 93% of classified proteins in a cluster were assigned the kegg function which was the majority assignment in the cluster. this means taking the majority vote of the cluster had an average prediction error of 7%. figure <dig> further indicates how the prediction accuracy is influenced by cluster size. although 16% of the clusters have no characterized proteins at all, using the entire cluster to predict function of unclassified proteins is a large improvement over using immediate neighbors since 60% of those were unclassified using kegg. the distribution of functional assignment of neighbors of an unclassified protein also varied based on the connectivity of the protein . there was a higher probability that an unknown protein connected to an environmental or metabolism protein if the connectivity was low whereas it was improbable to connect to an environmental protein for connectivities of 22– <dig> in fact, the distributions suggested the unknown proteins of degree <dig> and <dig> might be metabolism proteins, as only that category appeared among their notated neighbors. for connectivity <dig> there were <dig> classified proteins; <dig> are metabolism proteins and <dig> was involved in genetic information processing. for the <dig> classified proteins of connectivity <dig> all of them were metabolism proteins. predicting function based on the majority assignment of immediate neighbors or entire cluster both rely on the assumption that like interacts with like. however, it is interesting to note that this may not be valid, as suggested by the distributions of functional assignments of neighbors of characterized proteins . though the accuracy of the distributions was confounded by the strong presence of unclassified proteins, they suggested cellular process proteins preferentially interacted with genetic information processing proteins. moreover, genetic proteins slightly preferred to partner with metabolism proteins, with a small bias against interacting with environmental proteins. for environmental information processing and metabolism proteins, we see the expected behavior of interactions between proteins of the same function. this suggests that function prediction based on majority function will be more accurate for proteins whose true function is either of the latter and less accurate for the two former categories. this claim is investigated below. evaluating predictions based on topological properties of the <dig> unclassified proteins in the all co-conservation network, <dig> proteins had no annotated neighbors, while <dig> proteins were contained in a cluster containing no annotated neighbors. this means that in the former case, a function prediction algorithm based on immediate neighbors would fail, while in the latter case, a prediction algorithm which uses the entire cluster would fail. for cases such as these in which nearby annotations are not available, the distributions of figure <dig> suggest ways in which topological information might instead be exploited in function prediction algorithms. based on the observations detailed above, new predictions strategies were created to incorporate the connectivity of the protein and the differential preference of interaction based on the functions assigned to a protein pair. the contribution of each type and the combination of topological information was evaluated using a cross validation scheme where 10% of the <dig> classified proteins in the all network with at least one classified neighbor were taken at random as the test set, their functions hidden and predicted from quantities computed on the remaining 90% of classified proteins . from this training set, distributions of node connectivity, function within a cluster, and function among immediate neighbors in a cluster were calculated. results in figure <dig> show that the two baseline prediction methods, 1-sampleunif and 2-sampleglobal, which do not incorporate topological information had the poorest performances regardless of the annotation source used. a significant improvement over these baseline algorithms was seen using connectivity information alone . using kegg, nearly 44% of the proteins were classified correctly using just connectivity information. these results on classified proteins argue that despite being a simple topological characterization, connectivity could be particularly useful for unclassified proteins residing in clusters with no functional information, since majority-based methods can not be applied. methods which can incorporate functional information of the cluster in any form show substantial improvement over the baselines. though the 3-majorityneigh method outperformed the 4-majorityclust method, the prediction task was made easier in the evaluation than would be the case for true unclassified proteins; the requirement that each test protein be connected to at least one other classified protein ensured that there were likely labeled proteins in the immediate neighborhood from which to predict . the combination of connectivity information and preference bias for non-like pairs showed a significant improvement over preference bias alone for cog and kegg . moreover, 7-neighconnect showed no statistically significant difference in performance from 4-majorityclust for kegg and cog . these results indicated that choosing the majority function of the cluster or immediate neighborhood were better methods on average. however, when the set of proteins was divided into those whose function was predicted correctly or incorrectly using 4-majorityclust, most incorrect predictions were for proteins from clusters with a heterogeneous, almost uniform, distribution of function within the cluster. of the proteins whose function was predicted correctly by 4- majorityclust, only 30% resided in clusters with more than one function, compared to 100% for the set of incorrectly predicted proteins. methods 8– <dig> show the value of using connectivity information or preference bias of interaction when the function of the protein is not the majority function of the cluster. the results show the benefit of using connectivity and preference bias information, allowing up to 44% correct prediction for the set of proteins completely missed by one of the best methods, 4-majorityclust. though the average value was similar for 2-sampleglobal and 5-sampleconnect on all proteins, sampleglobal performed much worse than sampleconnect on this set of proteins . interestingly, the average connectivity of this set of incorrectly predicted proteins was high , suggesting that using topological information in predictions might be most useful for hub proteins. methods 11– <dig> test the prediction accuracy on the hub proteins, showing dramatic drops in performance for majorityneigh and majorityclust . in contrast, using connectivity information within sampleconnect showed a sharp increase in performance for the set of hubs. the sampleneigh method , based on neighbor information, suffered from noise introduced from the high connectivity, yet when combined with connectivity information allowed further improvement over connectivity information alone, even for the hubs. moreover, for the highly connected proteins, the topological based methods sampleconnect and neighconnect outperformed the majority based methods, majorityneigh and majorityclust. together these results suggest an improved function prediction algorithm for truly unclassified proteins, based on the topological properties examined here. when there is a single function assigned to the classified proteins in the cluster, use the majority function of the cluster for the uncharacterized protein. homogeneous neighbors and clusters are generally found for low connectivity proteins. when there is more than one function represented by classified proteins in the cluster, use a combination of connectivity and preference bias information for prediction. this situation generally occurs for highly connected proteins. overall, our results show connectivity is particularly useful for characterization of unclassified proteins residing in clusters where majority based methods either cannot be applied or would likely fail . function predictions in the artificial situation represented by our cross validation study, results showed that the majority based methods were effective for proteins whose immediate neighbors or cluster members were generally assigned a single function. for the true unclassified proteins, additional file <dig> shows the majority cluster method applied to the smaller clusters containing at least one unclassified protein and at least one classified protein using any annotation source. of the <dig> proteins in these <dig> clusters, <dig> proteins were unclassified by any annotation source. comparing our predictions to a later release of the cog database which provided new annotations for <dig> of the <dig> proteins, we predicted <dig> out of the <dig> correctly using the majority cluster method. CONCLUSIONS bacterial co-conservation networks share some topological properties with yeast protein-protein interaction and other biological networks, but differ in important aspects. like in yeast ppi networks, highly connected nodes are related to essential functions, and the co-conserved protein-protein interaction network appears to be scale free. it is unclear if the lack of variation observed in the remaining classes represents a true biological phenomenon or a limitation of resolution. there is no difference between the connectivity distributions of complexed and non-complexed proteins in our data to justify the use of connectivity for complex prediction. in this respect, co-conservation networks appear to be distinct from physical interaction networks. however connectivity in our networks does appear to be a reliable predictor for essentiality, in congruence with previous findings <cit> . we took advantage of several properties of the network to infer function for several of the uncharacterized proteins in e. coli k <dig> . the analysis of functional assignment for individual proteins and all protein pairs showed that the frequency of interaction between proteins depended on the function of each partner and on connectivity. an interesting future direction would be to incorporate these global observations within a function prediction algorithm and test the accuracy of using connectivity and neighbor function assignment information together to refine the likelihood of assigning a given function to an unknown protein.",

during mating are known to reduce pathogen transmission, to form mating plugs or spermatophores, and to be important in sperm competition. in addition, they trigger fundamental changes in female physiology, behavior, and reproduction <cit> . the major biologically active components of mag secretions are carbohydrates, lipids, and in particular accessory gland proteins <cit> . in drosophila melanogaster, more than <dig> acps have been identified <cit> . they play roles in the regulation of female receptivity <cit> , defense against bacteria <cit> , the activation of the female immune system <cit> , the efficiency of sperm storage <cit> , and the stimulation of ovulation and egg maturation <cit> . they are also decisive for the fertilization of eggs, as shown in experiments in which the activity of sperm of infertile mutant males lacking mags could be restored by subsequently re-mating females with males that provided acps but no sperm <cit> . in addition to stimulating immediate female fertility, mag products appear to negatively affect female lifespan <cit> . this reflects inter-sexual conflict <cit> : the reproductive interests of males and females concerning the consequences of a mating act may differ, in particular when females later re-mate with other partners. males prefer the female to maximize short-term investment into the offspring resulting from the present copulation, while females may benefit more from saving resources for later reproduction with other males. sexual conflict may result in sexually antagonistic co-evolution and acps indeed appear to evolve very rapidly, as predicted from the ensuing arms race <cit> . compared to the wealth of information on accessory gland products of drosophilids, studies on other insect species are seriously lagging behind <cit> . this is particularly the case for eusocial hymenoptera, despite the special implications that their life style and evolutionary history have on sexual conflict. in contrast to drosophila and other non-social insects, eusocial hymenoptera are characterized by life-long pair-bonding, even though the males frequently die after mating <cit> . investigations have shown that monogamy is the ancestral state of all truly eusocial organisms <cit> , and lifetime monogamy seems to be a universal precondition for the evolution of obligate eusociality <cit> . the queens of ants, eusocial bees, and wasps indeed mate only once or a few times early in their adult lives without ever re-mating again. sperm received during these matings is stored for months, years, or even decades, and utilized to fertilize eggs throughout the queens' lives. furthermore, queens first rear large numbers of sterile workers from fertilized eggs before switching to the production of female sexuals. hence, in contrast to males of non-social insects, eusocial insect males are expected to avoid harming the female, as this would reduce the total amount of female sexuals produced and, consequently, male reproductive success. instead, males should have evolved mechanisms that promote female performance. even where multiple mating has evolved after the monogamy window has been passed, competition among ejaculates <cit> is not expected to negatively affect female life span and future fecundity. inter-sexual conflict might thus be replaced by \"inter-sexual cooperation\", though intra-sexual conflict might still evolve. indeed, ant males appear to positively affect queen life span: regardless of being mated with a fertile or sterilized male, mated queens of cardiocondyla obscurior lived considerably longer than virgin queens <cit> . like in other insects, mag products of eusocial hymenoptera are involved in the formation of mating plugs <cit> and ejaculate competition <cit> . in addition, they presumably elicit rapid changes in the physiology and behavior of freshly mated queens, e.g., the shedding of wings, reluctance of mating again, and changes in cuticular hydrocarbons <cit> . it is likely that mag products, and in particular acps, are also involved in the life-prolonging effects of mating <cit> . nevertheless, very little is known about acps in eusocial hymenoptera other than the honey bee, apis mellifera <cit> . we therefore examined, which genes are differentially expressed in the male accessory glands of the ant leptothorax gredleri. virgin queens of l. gredleri attract males through \"female calling\", i.e., they climb up grass stems or similar, elevated positions near their maternal nests and release droplets of a sex pheromone from their poison glands <cit> . during mating, sperm is transferred within a gelatinous substance, functionally similar to a spermatophore. the latter stays inside the female's genital tract for several hours, while the sperm is slowly transferred into the spermatheca <cit> . females have been observed to copulate with multiple males but it is unclear whether ejaculate is transferred during all these matings. genetic analyses document single paternity of their offspring <cit> . in order to obtain information on gene products specifically produced by the accessory glands of l. gredleri males we generated a suppression subtractive library for transcripts using a representational difference analysis protocol. such an approach enriches tissue-specific transcripts by removing from the library sequences that are shared with control tissue . RESULTS rda library characteristics and bioinformatic analyses to detect differentially expressed genes in l. gredleri mags, we sequenced <dig> clones from the subtracted gland library, resulting in <dig> sequencing reads, of which <dig> reads representing <dig> different clones were of appropriate quality . after quality analysis and following cap <dig> assembly we obtained <dig> contigs and <dig> singlets as unique sequences . the sequences were submitted to genbank . blastx analyses of the uss revealed significant matches for <dig> uss. the remaining <dig> uss showed no significant matches to genes of other species. shown are the predicted gene, the number of ests assembled to each us, us size in bp, the respective organism, followed by the respective similarity index and corresponding gene ontology terms obtained from flybase http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/. most of the ests clustered to a sequence corresponding to an apis mellifera predicted gene similar to cg1486-pa. based on domain predictions, the fly ortholog of this gene is annotated in flybase as being involved in carboxylic acid metabolism. another us represented by <dig> ests showed similarity to a heat shock factor binding protein 1-like from apis mellifera, with the corresponding cg5446-pa in drosophila melanogaster. further uss were also formed by clustering considerable numbers of ests , such as us <dig> consisting of <dig> ests, and us <dig> composed of <dig> ests. none of these transcripts, however, presented matches when submitted to blastx analysis. in functional terms, the searches for orthologs revealed that, seven of the l. gredleri uss corresponded to functionally defined genes , with best hits to predicted a. mellifera proteins. by judging from gene ontology attributes, two are expected to be involved in energy-dependent transport processes, such as the atp synthase gamma chain and nervana <dig> a sodium/potassium-transporting atpase subunit. the leukocyte-antigen-related-like protein may function as a protein tyrosine phosphatase, while the kokopelli gene has a cyclin-dependent protein kinase regulator activity and is involved in male germ-line stem cell division. the final two sequences with predicted molecular functions are cg6910-pa, with inositol oxygenase activity, and an apis mellifera ribosomal protein lp <dig> given as being a structural constituent of ribosomes. still unknown are biological processes or molecular functions for the five remaining sequences with blastx matches. sjchgc <dig> and loc <dig> are both predicted proteins of the parasitic wasp nasonia vitripennis, and ciao- <dig> and cg32432-pa and heat shock factor binding protein 1-like are predicted proteins for a. mellifera. neither of these had matches with drosophila genes. quantitative rt-pcr analysis of rda library genes the rda method is applicable to systems where genomic information is either completely lacking or still in an incipient stage. rdas are able to detect both known and so far unknown transcripts, including regulatory rnas. however, being a high throughput approach, transcripts indicated by rda as differentially expressed should be further analyzed by specific gene-expression analyses, such as quantitative rt-pcr . thus, we designed gene-specific primers for <dig> of the <dig> rda products. one product contained repeats, and so it was not considered suitable for primer design. for six of the <dig> products we obtained primers, shown in table <dig> that reliably amplified specific products and, thus, were suitable for qrt-pcr. these were primers for the genes leukocyte-antigen-related-like and cg <dig> representing two genes with blastx matches and predicted functions, for ciao- <dig> and cg <dig> being genes with matches but of unknown function, and the final two being for us <dig> and us <dig> representing no-match sequences. for five of the six genes we could show that their mean transcript levels are at least two-times higher in the l. gredleri mags relative to body carcasses, this holding for all three of the analyzed male life cycle stages, except for ciao- <dig> in the males running outside the nest that were sexually mature samples . for the sixth gene, us <dig> overexpression was not validated. this may, thus, represent false positive rda identification, represented by a single sequencing read . when testing for statistical significance of differential expression by randomization tests built into rest software we could show significant overexpression in two genes. cg <dig> a gene with predicted carboxy-lyase activity, was not only represented by the highest number of ests , but was also confirmed as significantly overexpressed in mags of dark-pigmented male pupae and sexually mature males . the other gene, cg <dig> was shown to be significantly overexpressed in sexually mature males . for all of these five genes biological variation in expression levels was considerable, a problem frequently encountered in qrt-pcr analyses, even with highly controlled cell cultures <cit> . discussion and CONCLUSIONS using the rda method we successfully identified a set of <dig> genes as being differentially expressed in mags of the ant l. gredleri. unfortunately, a fully sequenced ant genome is not yet available, so an annotation against a genome was not feasible. such an annotation would be needed to identify proteins that are secreted into the lumen of l. gredleri mags, as their rnas should have hydrophobic amino-terminal signal sequences <cit> . for example, swanson et al. <cit> found that 24% of the <dig> identified genes in their study of drosophila male reproductive proteins have such a putative signal sequence. all best hit matches were against a. mellifera or n. vitripennis predicted genes, emphasizing the importance of these hymenopteran reference genomes in future gene expression studies in eusocial insects. nevertheless, most of our ests represented functionally undefined genes or ones without matches to known genes. at first sight, this might indicate rapid evolution and species specificity in mag secretion products, similar to what has been shown for mags of drosophila <cit> , where about 50% of the drosophila acps have no homologs outside the drosophilid species complex. when comparing the genes predicted to be differentially expressed in mags of l. gredleri with those identified in a proteome analysis of honey bee seminal fluid <cit> we did not find any matching gene products for the set with geneontology functional attributes. this finding would also be in favor of a rapid evolution hypothesis for mag products. queens of leptothorax are predominantly singly-mated <cit> , but occasional multiple mating might introduce intra-sexual conflict and thus increase the evolutionary tempo of seminal fluid proteins. in eusocial species with multiple mating, the beneficial effect of seminal fluid on sperm survival is reduced when seminal fluid is mixed with alien sperm <cit> . however, this may actually serve the interests of the queen rather than inflicting damage. furthermore, the queen appears to be in control of ejaculate competition, since the negative impact of seminal fluid on foreign sperm can be neutralized by secretions from the queen sperm-storage organ <cit> . in this case, intra-sexual conflict seems to be controlled by inter-sexual cooperation. concerning our studies, nothing is as yet known on the molecular nature of mag secretions of other ant species, and with apis mellifera and nasonia vitripennis being the closest species for genomic comparisons, the percentage of functionally undefined genes and of no-match ests might simply reflect the large phylogenetic distance separating ants, bees, and parasitic wasps. speculating about the speed of the evolution of l. gredleri acps would, at this point, be premature, especially since, 2d-electrophoreses of acps suggest that they are conserved in l. gredleri and related taxa relative to, e.g., muscle proteins . furthermore, not all seminal fluid genes can be subject to rapid evolution, because successful reproduction must be assured. in a cross-species comparison of drosophila mag protein encoding genes, mueller et al. <cit> found not only rapidly evolving but also conserved genes, and functionally similar proteins may be represented and relevant in the seminal fluid of other animals <cit> . members of protein classes conserved across organisms in seminal fluids may reflect their general importance in reproductive physiology <cit> and might therefore be beneficial for both males and females. in this context, immune defense proteins are of special interest. mags secrete proteins of antimicrobial activity <cit> and proteins, which regulate the expression of genes with antimicrobial activity in females after sperm transfer <cit> . such acps might successively protect sperm from microbial attack in the reproductive tracts of both sexes, as well as coat eggs when they are laid. a l. gredleri est, whose ortholog cg <dig> is known to be upregulated in d. melanogaster females after mating <cit> , might play such a role. the drosophila gene is annotated as possibly showing oxidoreductase activity and being downregulated after bacterial infection. for the elucidation of its function in ants, it should be of interest to see whether the gene similar to cg <dig> is also differentially expressed in virgin and mated l. gredleri queens. females are not 'silent partners' when it comes to seminal fluids and it is always an interplay of male and female factors that coordinates the gametes for fertilization <cit> . the cg <dig> protein predicted in the honey bee genome as a drosophila ortholog with undefined function was found to be significantly overexpressed in sexually mature l. gredleri males, and one gene similar to cg1486-pa was found to be overexpressed in two male life cycle stages. this latter protein is predicted to have a carboxy-lyase activity and might be involved in carboxylic acid metabolism, catalyzing the non-hydrolytic addition or removal of a carboxyl group to or from a compound. carboxylic acids are widespread in nature, giving rise to fatty acids. fatty acids, such as palmitic-, linoleic-, oleic-, and stearic-acids, have been described as components of the mating plug in the bumblebee bombus terrestris, which form a physical barrier <cit> and prevent re-mating <cit> . mating plugs were also found in fire ants <cit> , queenless dinoponera ants <cit> , attine ants <cit> , stingless bees <cit> , and in the honey bee. in the latter, however, they do not play a function as a plug, but rather as a mating sign that may even promote multiple matings <cit> . in l. gredleri, the existence of a spermatophore that could be comparable to a mating plug was already shown <cit> . the overexpression of a gene with carboxy-lyase activity in the late pupal stage, when the accessory glands are already formed, and in sexually mature males found outside the nest supports the idea that accessory gland products are crucial for spermatophore formation in this species. taken together, our current study represents a first step addressing at a molecular level the reproductive interplay between l. gredleri males and their mates. mag products identified in this study may play different roles, either as conserved or as species-specific proteins. understanding the molecular underpinnings of differences in reproductive strategies among non-social and eusocial species, and in the latter among monogamous and polygamous ones will still require sequencing of mag products in a range of species. nevertheless, we believe that at this interface of \"molecular communication\" between the sexes, much can be gained towards comprehending the evolution of eusociality at the passage through the monogamy window <cit> , with inter-sexual conflict being replaced by inter-sexual cooperation.",

RESULTS genotyping of <dig> rad panel and rh map construction the bovine <dig> rad panel was constructed to complement an existing <dig> rad panel and increase the mapping resolution <cit> . we used snp markers for rh mapping because of their availability from the bovine genome sequencing project, their abundance throughout the genome <cit> and the ease and low cost of large scale snp genotyping <cit> . correct snp marker order is also essential for a variety of gene discovery approaches such as interval mapping or linkage disequilibrium based methods. the snp markers were chosen from the bovine build <dig> and typed on the <dig> k wg-rh panel using the illumina beadstation genotyping system <cit> . this genotyping system produces reproducible and robust data due to its <dig> fold redundancy at each locus. there is an average of <dig> representatives of each bead type present on every array which allows for <dig> independent genotypes of each snp locus. three positive and three negative controls were used in the experiment. all markers observed with even a small amount of amplification in any of the three negative controls were discarded. also, any markers which did not exhibit clear cluster separation between positive and negative controls were discarded. the remaining markers were scored as described previously <cit> . a total of <dig> % loci on bta <dig> and <dig> % loci on bta <dig> were successfully amplified and scored. markers were selected from the bovine build <dig> which had a significant number of snps misassigned to the wrong chromosomes. hence, out of <dig> and <dig> successfully amplified loci on bta <dig> and <dig> we mapped <dig> and <dig> markers on bta <dig> and bta <dig> respectively. the details of the snp markers mapped on bta <dig> and <dig> are provided in additional file <dig> rh maps were constructed using the comparative mapping approach of carthagène software <cit> which allows us to simultaneously exploit the rh data and the knowledge of a known related order. rh likelihood is sensitive to large scale ordering discrepancies, as produced by the assembly errors, but has difficulties to order closely related markers reliably. the assembly itself, despite possible assembly errors, is very informative at low scale . because it exploits more data than pure rh mapping, it cannot be related to framework mapping. however, as shown earlier <cit> , integrating these two types of information produces high resolution maps of better quality. in this case, it also pinpoints likely assembly errors. on bta <dig> we observed <dig> different retention patterns, <dig> unique retention patterns and <dig> shared compatible retention patterns, out of <dig> loci tested. the loci sharing compatible retention patterns suggest that they were so close that radiation could not induce any chromosomal break between them. the average retention frequency for all the mapped markers on bta <dig> was <dig> % and varied from <dig> % for bta- <dig> to <dig> % for bta- <dig> . the markers in the close vicinity of thymidine kinase gene on bta <dig> reflected higher retention frequencies as this marker was used to select for hybrid cell lines <cit> . similarly on bta <dig> we observed <dig> different retention patterns, <dig> unique retention patterns and <dig> shared compatible retention patterns, out of <dig> loci tested. the average retention frequency for all the mapped markers on bta <dig> was <dig> % and varied from <dig> % for bta- <dig> to <dig> % for bta- <dig> with higher retention frequencies towards the telomeric end of the chromosome. previous studies have reported that the pattern of retention frequencies varies markedly between chromosomes <cit> . the total length of the rh maps of bta <dig> and bta <dig> extended to <dig> cr and <dig> cr, respectively . additional information about the maps, including the average resolution, and the range and standard deviation of the marker distances, is provided in table <dig> comparison with the bovine build <dig> sequences we aligned our chromosomal maps with the bovine build <dig> sequences for bta <dig> and bta <dig> and found an overall agreement of order of loci between the two maps, although a number of inconsistencies were observed. out of the <dig> markers mapped to the 12k map of bta <dig> <dig> markers were assigned to bta <dig> by the bovine genome sequence assembly. for <dig> loci, we could detect scaffolds, which were not assigned to any chromosome by the sequence assembly . fourteen loci did not show acceptable hits with the bovine genome sequence assembly. one hundred and four markers were found to be incongruous and twelve scaffolds were found to be misplaced. five scaffolds were found to be transposed and six were found to be inverted. in total, seventy four markers within scaffolds were found to be misplaced. one marker, bta- <dig> was assigned bovine chromosome <dig> by the sequence assembly . in addition, we observed a total of <dig> gaps on the bta <dig> map . for bta <dig> out of the <dig> markers mapped, <dig> markers were assigned to bta <dig> by the bovine genome sequence assembly. similarly, we could detect scaffolds for <dig> loci, which were not assigned any chromosome by the sequence assembly . twelve loci did not show any acceptable hits with the sequence assembly. forty five markers were found to be incongruous and ten scaffolds were found to be misplaced. four scaffolds were found to be transposed and three scaffolds were found to be inverted. one marker, bta- <dig> was assigned bovine chromosome <dig> by the sequence assembly . in total, twenty five markers within scaffolds were found to be misplaced. furthermore, we observed <dig> gaps on the bta <dig> rh map . for comparison, we computed the loglikelihood and length of maps built according to the bovine genome sequence order. we re-evaluated maps under a pure diploid rh model using all markers that had a match on the bovine build <dig> sequences. there were <dig> markers that were in common with bovine build <dig> sequences and rh map of bta <dig> the map built according to the bovine build <dig> sequence order has a log-10-likelihood of - <dig> and extends up to <dig> cr, whereas the map built according to our rh map order has a log-10-likelihood of - <dig> and extends up to <dig> cr . for bta <dig> there were <dig> markers that were common between rh map and bovine build <dig> sequences. the map built according to the bovine build <dig> sequence order has a log-10-likelihood of - <dig> and extends up to <dig> cr, whereas the map built according to our rh map order has a log-10-likelihood of - <dig> and extends up to <dig> cr . thus based on the rh data, the map derived from the bovine genome sequence is much less likely than our rh map order with log10-likelihood ratio differences of - <dig> and - <dig> for bta <dig> and bta <dig> respectively. generation of the cattle-human comparative map excluding binned markers, four hundred and fourteen and one hundred and seventy-five markers having human orthologs were used for the construction of cattle-human comparative maps. we identified <dig> homologous synteny blocks on bta <dig> and <dig> hsbs on bta <dig> as shown in figures <dig> and <dig> respectively . also, <dig> breakpoints were identified between bta <dig> and the corresponding segments in the hsa <dig> while <dig> breakpoints were identified between bta <dig> and hsa <dig> we compared our maps with the previous studies <cit> . the details of the number of markers used in all the three studies, number of hsbs, their size range and their median is provided in table <dig> the hsbs identified in our study are more in number as well as smaller in size because of the high density of markers mapped on the chromosomes. in addition, several of the <dig> and <dig> snp markers mapped on bta <dig> and <dig> respectively, did not produce hits on the bovine and human chromosome sequences at the given expectation threshold, and some produced hits on other human chromosomes, thus resulting in a larger number of smaller hsbs than previously described. the coordinates of our hsbs overall were in agreement with those identified in both earlier studies. however, small discrepancies in the orientation of a few hsbs were observed. nine of the previously identified hsbs on hsa <dig> and <dig> on hsa <dig> <cit> were split into <dig> and <dig> hsbs respectively, in our study. in the schibler et al. <cit> study, <dig> hsbs on hsa <dig> and <dig> on hsa <dig> were split into <dig> and <dig> hsbs respectively. one of the hsbs on hsa <dig> found in our study as well as in everts-van der wind et al. <cit> study, was not reported by schibler et al. <cit> . the synteny block from <dig> – <dig> mb identified in both of the previous studies <cit> on hsa <dig> is absent from our comparative map. we have only <dig> markers in that region and they both show hits in the human genome at the same position of <dig> mb. therefore, although we cannot define them as a synteny block, our data supports the presence of the synteny block on hsa <dig> one region from 129– <dig> mb in hsa <dig> shows disagreement across all the three studies and needs further investigation. the reason for minor discrepancies with the previous studies may be attributed to the use of different radiation hybrid panel and the mapping approach used. CONCLUSIONS we have built a high resolution rh map of bovine chromosomes <dig> and <dig> consisting of <dig> and <dig> snp markers, respectively. maps of both the chromosomes, when compared with the bovine genome sequence assembly, show that there is significant internal rearrangement of the markers involving displacement, inversion and flips within the scaffolds and some scaffolds were found to be misplaced by the third draft of the bovine genome assembly. the rh maps reported here with an average resolution of <dig> locus/ <dig> kb and <dig> locus/ <dig> kb on bta <dig> and bta <dig> respectively, are useful for ordering snp markers which can be used in future gene discovery investigations. furthermore, they aid in the identification and rectification of potential errors in the current bovine genome sequence assembly.",

    "prompt": "Condense the following clinical passage into a short summary. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND massively parallel deep coverage next generation sequencing technologies have stimulated efforts of de novo genome sequence assembly in recent years. while ngs data productions advance at phenomenal rates, accurate genome assembly and annotation remain challenging, and the extent of what may be missing in these de novo assembled genomes is an ongoing matter of concern. all genome assembly efforts face the challenge of accurately assembling tandem and sparse repeat sequences. current assembly algorithms collapse identical or very similar repeats leading to potential reduction or loss of genomic complexity <cit> . the short reads produced by current ngs technologies are especially prone to this problem, as repetitive sequences can be resolved only if the reads are long enough to span the repetitive region <cit> . a frequent practice is to exclude highly repetitive sequences in genome assembly and annotation, on the assumption that they lack protein-coding genes. while this assumption is generally valid, here we provide a clear example that excluding what appears to be simple repetitive sequences could result in the exclusion of an important fitness genotype, in the case of the atlantic cod genome. atlantic cod is a key commercial fishery species in the cold waters of the north atlantic seas and a prime target for domestication by countries across the north atlantic ocean. star et al. <cit> recently reported the annotated genome of a specimen from the cold-adapted north east arctic cod stock from the barents sea. the neac_ <dig> genome was among the first complex vertebrate genomes assembled entirely from short reads obtained using the roche <dig> gs flx titanium platform. the report discussed the interesting potential thermal adaptive properties of the hemoglobins of the cod, as well as its unique adaptive immune system as related to organismal fitness <cit> . while not the focus of the discussion, it is nevertheless surprising that a crucial fitness trait, the antifreeze glycoprotein <cit> , which has clear relevance for aquaculture of the species in cold, northerly latitudes, was absent from genome annotations and predicted transcripts and proteins. neither was any allusion made to its presence in the extensive supplementary notes accompanying the report. afgp is one of the diverse, novel antifreeze proteins that evolved in various polar and subpolar marine teleost lineages, enabling their survival in freezing, icy seawater <cit> . presence of afgps is long known in a number of northern and arctic atlantic cod populations <cit> . the near-identical afgps in the arctic/northern cods and in the unrelated antarctic notothenioid fishes endemic to the southern ocean, is an established prime example of convergent evolution and at the rare protein sequence level <cit> . antifreeze proteins recognize environmental ice crystals that enter the fish, bind to them and stop their expansion, thereby prevent the fish body fluids, which have less salt and thus a higher freezing point than seawater, from freezing <cit> . absence of the afgp genotype in the cold-adapted neac_ <dig> would seem inconsistent with its frigid arctic habitats. afgps are highly repetitive in sequence in the protein and particularly in the coding sequences because they are encoded as large polyprotein precursors <cit> . thus the possibility exists that the repetitive afgp coding sequence repeats might have been inadvertently excluded along with other non-protein coding repetitive sequences during genome sequence assembly. here we report investigations of the atlantic cod genome data leading to our discovery that afgp coding sequences exist in neac_ <dig> we provide experimental evidence as well as bioinformatics proofs from comparative genomic sequence analyses, which support the presence of an afgp gene family in atlantic cod. from examining in detail the published methodologies in the atlantic cod genome assembly and annotation process, we deduced the probable causes leading to the exclusion of this major genetic trait. RESULTS afgp gene family in atlantic cod to experimentally verify the presence of the afgp genotype specifically in the north east arctic cod and norwegian coastal cod , used for genome sequencing and bac library support respectively <cit> , we performed southern blot analysis of genomic dna of multiple individuals from these two populations . these individuals were collected from several sites along the finnmark coast and marginal barents sea. we identified them as neac or ncc based on the specimen’s pantophysin i genotype, the accepted marker for distinguishing the two stocks <cit> . the neac stock is homozygous for the presence of an internal drai restriction site in its pani, while the ncc is homozygous for the absence , and heterozygous individuals can be from either stock but more likely ncc <cit> . all neac and ncc individuals we examined showed multiple strong afgp-hybridizing bands to an afgp coding sequence probe derived from the related, fully afgp-fortified polar cod boreogadus saida <cit> , similar to the hybridization in the three polar cod individuals included as positive controls . the repetitive coding sequence of the afgp polyprotein precursor is encompassed in a single exon for known gadid afgp genes <cit> ; this study], and does not contain recognition sequence sites for the restriction enzyme taqi used for the genomic dna digests. therefore, each hybridizing band in the genomic southern blot represents one or more afgp genes, indicating that a family of afgp genes or highly similar sequences are present in the genome of both neac and ncc. furthermore, we constructed a partial genomic dna library for a g. morhua individual from outer Øresund, denmark, and isolated and characterized an afgp gene named gm1- <dig> . we also quantified the circulating afgps to be about 5 mg/ml in the blood serum of individuals from the Øresund population , supporting the presence of functional afgp genes in atlantic cod. afgp locus in atlantic cod genome we envisioned that afgp cds would still be in the raw genome data of the sequenced neac_ <dig> thus we blast searched the raw assembly atlcod1a with gm1- <dig> afgp sequence as query. , with glycosylation on the thr residues <cit> . the alignment shows that the partial afgp genes of neac_ <dig> encode the characteristic tandem tripeptide repeats of the afgp peptide backbone, as well as the conserved c-terminus sequence, aaavl*. the aligned nucleotide sequences between atlcod1a_afgp <dig> and gm1- <dig> are <dig> % identical, thus the two are quite clearly counterparts of each other in neac_ <dig> and the Øresund individual. these high sequence identities indicate that at least some of the neac_ <dig> partial afgp genes we identified from the two altcod1a sequence scaffolds are intact/functional genes. to determine the spatial relationship of the two afgp-containing atlcod1a scaffolds, we compared their sequences to the genomic afgp locus of the related polar cod b. saida currently being reconstructed from bac clone sequences in our laboratory. the two atlcod1a sequence scaffolds aligned with a ~200 kbp portion of our polar cod afgp locus assembly . the spatial alignment map of the two atlcod1a scaffolds with the polar cod afgp partial locus is shown in figure 2a, and the nucleotide alignments in the form of sequence identity plots using vista <cit> are shown in figure 2b, c for the two scaffolds respectively. the extensive conserved regions between the two cods included both afgp coding sequences and intergenic sequences, and they share high nucleotide identities , indicating they are microsyntenic regions. the microsynteny is further supported by two hypothetic protein coding genes shared by the two species in the nearby upstream region to their respective afgp locus . we also identified a third afgp-containing scaffold, in the atlcod1b/celera assembly , which spans the gap between the two atlcod1a scaffolds, confirming they are collinear . together, the results from the genomic southern blot and comparative sequence analyses clearly support an afgp genomic locus with intact genes is present in the sequenced neac_ <dig> possible cause of afgp exclusion from the annotated cod genome through detailed examination of the assembly and annotation process described by star et al. <cit> in their supplementary notes, we deduced the possible cause of afgp exclusion in the annotated atlantic cod genome to be two-fold. the primary cause is the removal of repetitive sequences in the initial steps of the bioinformatics pipeline, and secondarily due to the use of genomes of non-afgp bearing model teleosts as reference for annotating protein gene content in atlantic cod. afgp sequences are repetitive in the protein and highly repetitive in the encoding gene <cit> . gadid afgps are encoded as a large polyprotein precursor containing multiple afgp molecules that are cleaved post-translationally at arg or lys residues that occasionally replace thr in the ala/pro-ala-thr tripeptide repeats, to produce the different afgp size isoforms . thus the afgp polyprotein coding sequence region, encompassed in a single large exon, consists of a long run of repetitive 9-nucleotide sequences that resemble short tandem repeats . as illustration, the single coding exon of the atlantic cod afgp polyprotein in gm1- <dig> is ~ <dig> 3 kbp, and contains <dig> three-codon repeats encoding <dig> tripeptide repeats. a tally of the codon usage shows pronounced bias, resulting in a predominant 9-nt sequence of gc-gcc-ac, which will appear to assembler algorithms as a very long string of 9-nt strs. also because of the codon bias, this repeated 9-nt sequence can be further reduced into a 3-nt equivalent of the predominant sequence c , which will likely be regarded by assembly programs as trinucleotide simple sequence repeats . escalating the repetitiveness is that gadid afgp polyprotein genes have duplicated under selection from frigid marine conditions, forming multigene families that would meet the demand for an abundance of the survival protein. the two atlcod1a sequence scaffolds alone contain seven afgp genes , and potentially more if additional genes exist within the gaps. this expectedly will result in a plethora of short repetitive afgp coding sequences in the deep-coverage raw roche <dig> reads. note: there are a total of <dig> single codons from the <dig> 9-nt repeats in gm1- <dig> supplementary note <dig> of star et al. <cit> indicated that before assembling the roche <dig> reads, they “excluded highly repetitive, non-informative reads” from their data set. they stated that these included shotgun reads encompassing strs and ssrs, and sets of paired-end reads if one or both ends consist of strs or ssrs. this data reduction likely completely eliminated the str- or ssr-like afgp cds except for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the afgp coding exon immediately adjacent to non-repetitive upstream and downstream sequence , leading to gaps in the middle of afgp genes we identified in the two atlcod1a scaffolds . the str/ssr-culled read data were assembled using newbler and the celera assembler, generating atlcod1a and atlcod1b respectively . the newbler assembly atlcod1a was chosen for genome annotation. repeat masking was applied to atlcod1a using existing te libraries and a de novo created custom library for cod, resulting in the masking of <dig> % of the assembly. the repeat-masked atlcod1a then underwent whole-genome structural alignment and re-ordering using the three-spined stickleback genome as reference followed by projection annotation supplementary note <dig> of <cit> . we compared the unmasked and repeat-masked version of atlcod1a, and found most of the afgp cds that survived the str/ssr culling became masked , rendering the afgp genotype essentially non-existent prior to protein gene annotation. annotation was carried out by projecting protein-coding gene models from three-spined stickleback through the whole genome alignments onto the re-ordered cod genomic regions. additional protein-coding gene models from other teleost genomes were mapped onto cod genome regions having no alignment with stickleback . none of these model teleosts require antifreeze protection in their temperate or tropical habitats and had not evolved the novel antifreeze genotype, thus, the exclusion of a major genetic trait in the assembled atlantic cod genome remained unrecognized. gene-rich repetitive sequences exclusion of the well-known prominent and important afgp trait in atlantic cod genome annotation brings to light that common assumptions of repetitive sequences as gene-less or gene-poor do not always apply. atlantic cod afgp genes are by no means a lone case of gene-rich repetitive sequences representing a major and/or novel trait. other prominent proteins composed of short repetitive sequences are present in a variety of organisms, including the convergently evolved afgps in the antarctic notothenioids <cit> , other antifreeze proteins in fish <cit> , insects <cit> and plants <cit> , fibrous silk fibroins in spiders <cit> and moths <cit> , amelogenin in primates <cit> , human dentin sialophosphoprotein <cit> , involucrin <cit> , collagens <cit> , and others. exclusion of the repetitive coding sequences of these prominent proteins from the genome assembly of the respective organism would be a major blunder. missing repetitive and duplicated sequences due to limitations in sequence assemblers has also resulted in omission of more subtle coding exons in human genomes despite the availability of a highly refined reference genome <cit> . CONCLUSIONS we have “resurrected” some of the missing afgp genes from the atlantic cod raw genome assemblies, and reconstructed a partial genomic afgp locus for this species. while it is well appreciated that all genome assemblies have gaps of information due to bioinformatics limitations, missing a known and prominent fitness trait lends to confusion in the field. we therefore suggest that this biologically relevant trait be restored to the cod genome annotations. the gadid afgp trait is relevant not only to the biology and culturing potential of the cod species, but as an evolutionary innovation, has broad relevance in the pursuit of understanding molecular mechanisms of invention of new gene and function. for the ever expanding efforts at de novo assembly of new genomes, the case of the missing atlantic cod afgp genotype hopefully will promote vigilance in avoiding categorical assumptions that all repetitive sequences lack protein coding information. while we await improved algorithms for accurately assembling repetitive sequences, longer reads from traditional sequencing methods such as sanger still has its place and the painstaking approach of assembling repeat sequences with extensive manual inspection and validation is unavoidable. this approach has been successfully applied to assemble the ~400 kbp highly repetitive and polymorphic afgp genomic locus that convergently evolved in the antarctic notothenioid fish <cit> . lastly, while projection annotation of de novo assembled genomes of new species using model genomes as reference certainly has great utility, novel traits might have evolved since the species diverged. thus an appreciation of the evolutionary history and major known biological traits of a new species targeted for genome sequencing is inevitably necessary.",

    "prompt": "Provide a concise recap of the clinical trial results. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND h <dig> is a paternally imprinted gene encoding a noncoding rna <cit> . as one of the first imprinted genes discovered, h <dig> was initially identified as a tumor suppressor because embryo-derived tumor cells overexpressing h <dig> exhibited growth retardation, morphological changes and abrogated clonogenicity in soft agar, as well as suppressed tumorigenicity in nude mice <cit> . downregulation of h <dig> gene expression was identified as an early event in the formation of several tumor types <cit> . recently it was demonstrated that mice lacking h <dig> showed an overgrowth phenotype, while transgenic mice overexpressing h <dig> showed postnatal growth reduction <cit> . in contrast, overexpression or loss of imprinting of h <dig> has been observed in a wide variety of tumors, including bladder carcinoma <cit> , epithelial ovarian cancer <cit> , esophageal cancer <cit> , lung cancer <cit> , breast adenocarcinoma <cit> , endometrial cancer <cit> , and invasive cervical carcinoma <cit> . h <dig> knockdown significantly decreased the clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth property of several breast and lung cancer cell lines <cit> . a link between h <dig> and several tumorigenesis-related genes, such as c-myc <cit> , thioredoxin <cit> and e2f <dig> <cit> , has been well established. thus, it remains controversial whether h <dig> functions as a tumor promotor or a tumor suppressor, and it is possible that h <dig> plays differential roles depending on tissue type and/or developmental stage <cit> . h <dig> is highly expressed in trophoblast tissue, predominantly but not exclusively from the maternal allele <cit> . complete hydatidiform moles showed high-level expression of h <dig> from the paternal allele, while choriocarcinomas developing from chms had reduced numbers of h19-positive cells <cit> . h <dig> downregulation was also observed in gestational trophoblastic tumors <cit> . these observations appear to support the notion that h <dig> functions as a tumor suppressor in trophoblast tissue. however, ariel i et al. found that h <dig> expression was found to be abundant, in a decreasing order, in the intermediate trophoblast , the cytotrophoblast, and the syncytiotrophoblast. and prominent expression of h <dig> was found in placental site trophoblastic tumor and gestational choriocarcinoma <cit> . after choriocarcinoma-derived jeg- <dig> cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, a five-fold increase in h <dig> rna level was detected in the resulting tumors, and cells highly expressing h <dig> were more tumorigenic <cit> . therefore, the exact role of h <dig> in the trophoblast is yet undetermined. in previous studies, we demonstrated that dna methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine could demethylate the promoter region of the h <dig> gene, upregulate the expression of h <dig> transcript, and reduce the proliferation, migration and invasion properties of choriocarcinoma-derived jeg- <dig> cells <cit> . as the demethylating effects of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine are unspecific, other genes may be demethylated in tandem and complicate the biological effects. to further clarify our understanding of the function of the h <dig> gene in choriocarcinoma, we developed lentiviral vectors expressing h19-specific small interfering rna for use in human choriocarcinoma cells. considering that the human choriocarcinoma cell line jar is more easily infected by lentiviruses than the cell line jeg- <dig> , jar cells were used in the present study. using the sirna technology, we investigated the impact of h <dig> knockdown on the proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of jar cells. furthermore, we examined the effects of h <dig> knockdown on the expression of the insulin-like growth factor <dig> , hairy and enhancer of split homologue- <dig> , and dual-specific phosphatase <dig> genes, which were chosen based on the previous evidence that h <dig> is a negative regulator of igf <dig> <cit> and our unpublished observation that the expression of hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> genes was altered in jeg- <dig> cells transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector carrying the full-length h <dig> cdna. methods cell culture human choriocarcinoma cell line jar was purchased from american type culture collection . after thawing, cells were allowed to grow in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium/ham’s nutrient mixture f <dig> medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% co <dig> after three passages, cells were used for viral infection. construction and screening of lentiviral vectors harboring h19-specific sirna the following sirna target sequences in the human h <dig> gene were selected: target <dig> gccttcaagcattccatta; target <dig> ggagagttagcaaaggtga; target <dig> cgtgacaagcaggacatga; and target <dig> gaggaaccagacctcatca. four pairs of complementary oligonucleotides were then designed . the stem-loop oligonucleotides were synthesized and cloned into a lentivirus-based vector carrying the green fluorescent protein gene . a universal sequence was used as a negative control for rna interference. lentiviral particles were prepared as previously described <cit> . the four sirna-carrying lentiviral vector constructs were used to infect jar cells at a multiplicity of infection of <dig> and <dig> . three days after infection, gfp expression was detected to calculate the infection efficiency. five days after infection, cells were harvested. real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine h <dig> knockdown efficiency and screen for the sirna with the highest knockdown efficiency which was then used for subsequent experiments. rna isolation, reverse transcription and quantitative pcr total rna isolation using trizol reagent and reverse transcription using moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. quantitative pcr was performed in a final volume of <dig> μl containing <dig> μl cdna, <dig> μl primers and <dig> μl sybr premix extaq . the cycling conditions were: 95°c for <dig> min; <dig> cycles of 95°c for <dig> s and 60°c for <dig> s; and one cycle of 95°c for <dig> s, 55°c for <dig> s and 95°c for <dig> s. the sequences of primers used in real-time rt-pcr were as follows: forward 5′-tcccagaacccacaacatgaa-3′ and reverse 5′-ttcaccttccagagccgattc-3′ for h <dig> ; forward 5′-tcctcacctcgctactcg-3′ and reverse 5′-acatccacgcaacactcag-3′ for dusp <dig> ; forward 5′-gagaggcggctaaggtgtttg-3′ and reverse 5′-ctggtgtagacggggatgac-3′ for hes- <dig> ; forward 5′-cctccagttcgtctgtggg-3′ and reverse 5′-cacgtccctctcggacttg-3′ for igf <dig> ; and forward 5′-ggcggcaccaccatgtaccct-3′ and reverse 5′-aggggccggactcgtcatact -3′ for beta-actin . data analysis was performed using the 2-ΔΔct method. the experiment was independently repeated three times. cell cycle analysis cells were seeded onto six-well plates and cultured. upon reaching 80% confluence, cells were released by digestion with trypsin and harvested. after centrifugation, the cell pellet was washed twice with pre-cooled phosphate buffered saline and fixed with pre-cooled 70% ethanol. then, cells were resuspended in pbs, filtered through a 400-mesh sieve, and stained with propidium iodide at 37°c for <dig> min. the cell cycle was then determined by flow cytometry as previously described <cit> . apoptosis assay apoptosis was detected using the aposcreen annexin v apoptosis kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. in addition, one more group of cells was incubated with <dig> μg/ml diaminedichloroplatinum for <dig> hours and subjected to apoptosis assay. the experiment was independently repeated three times. methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay cells were seeded in sextuplicate for each condition in 96-well plates at a density of 2×104/ml in <dig> μl per well. after <dig> hours of culture, medium was replaced. cells were then further cultured in this manner for 1– <dig> days. four hours before the termination of culture, mtt was added at a volume of <dig> μl per well. afterwards, the entire supernatant was discarded and dimethyl sulfoxide was added at a volume of <dig> μl per well and incubated in an air bath shaker at 37°c for <dig> min. the absorbance at <dig> nm of each well was determined using the <dig> multilabel counter . the experiment was independently repeated three times. cell invasion assay the cell invasion assay was performed using a commercial kit , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the chemicon cell invasion assay is performed in an invasion chamber, a 24-well tissue culture plate with <dig> cell culture inserts. the inserts contain an <dig> μm pore size polycarbonate membrane, over which a thin layer of ecmatrixtm is dried. the ecmatrixtm layer serves as an in vitro reconstituted basement membrane and occludes the membrane pores, blocking non-invasive cells from migrating through. invasive cells, on the other hand, migrate through the ecm layer and cling to the bottom of the polycarbonate membrane. before jar cells were plated at a density of <dig> × <dig> cells in each insert, <dig> μl of warm serum free media were added to the interior of the inserts to rehydrate the ecm layer for 1– <dig> hours at room temperature. cells were incubated at 37°c in 5% co <dig> for <dig> h. a cotton-tipped swab was used to gently remove non-invading cells as well as the ecmatrix gel from the interior of the inserts. five hundred microliters of staining solution were added to the unoccupied wells of the plate. invasive cells on lower surface of the membrane were stained by dipping inserts in the staining solution for <dig> minutes. inserts were dipped in a beaker of water several times to rinse and air dried. stained cells were dissolved in 10% acetic acid and od at <dig> nm was detected by colorimetric reading. each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated three times. statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss <dig> software package . numerical data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. multiple means were compared using analysis of variance and the tukey post hoc test, while two means were compared using student’s t-test. a p value of less than <dig> was considered statistically significant. RESULTS selection of the lentiviral vector harboring sirna with the highest knockdown efficiency the four lentiviral constructs harboring different sirnas were used to infect jar cells. in parallel, a negative control was run. the infection efficiencies of these lentiviral vectors were all above 80% as revealed by fluorescence microscopy . real-time rt-pcr assay showed that all four constructs, whether they were used at a high or low moi, could significantly downregulate h <dig> gene expression in jar cells . the highest knockdown efficiency was achieved using kd <dig> , which was subsequently designated as h19-rnai-lv- <dig> h <dig> knockdown inhibited the proliferation of jar cells the percentage of cells in g <dig> phase was significantly higher in the h <dig> knockdown group than in the nc group , while the percentages of cells in g2/m phase and s phase respectively showed no significant changes between the two groups . the mtt assay showed that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in the h <dig> knockdown group as compared to that in the nc group . h <dig> knockdown inhibited apoptosis of jar cells as shown in figure <dig> h <dig> knockdown significantly increased the percentage of normal cells but decreased the percentage of early apoptotic cells when compared to the negative control group . after incubation with diaminedichloroplatinum for <dig> hours, the percentage of normal cells was still significantly higher in the h <dig> knockdown group than in the nc group , while the percentage of early apoptotic cells was still significantly lower in the h <dig> knockdown group than in the nc group . h <dig> knockdown does not alter the invasion of jar cells to determine if h <dig> knockdown was able to affect the invasion properties of jar cells, the cell invasion assay was performed. the invasion rate of cells in the h <dig> knockdown group and the nc group were <dig> % ± <dig> % and <dig> % ± <dig> %, respectively. h <dig> knockdown had no significant impact on the invasion rate of jar cells. the result was shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> h <dig> knockdown upregulated hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> expression but not igf <dig> expression to gain insight into how h <dig> knockdown alters the phenotype of human choriocarcinoma cells, we examined the expression of igf <dig> hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> mrnas by real-time rt-pcr. the results showed that, compared with the negative control group, h <dig> knockdown significantly upregulated the expression of hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> mrnas , but had no significant impact on the expression of igf <dig> mrna . the ct values were shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> discussion using a lentiviral vector harboring h19-specific sirna, the expression of h <dig> in jar cells was specifically downregulated. we showed that the invasion of jar cells was not affected in response to h <dig> downregulation, which is inconsistent with our previous studies indicating that 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine-mediated h <dig> upregulation could reduce the invasion capacity of jeg- <dig> cells <cit> . this may be due to unspecific demethylating effects of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine or differences among the cell types studied. furthermore, we also demonstrated that h <dig> knockdown inhibited the apoptosis and proliferation properties of jar cells. the results of the present study indicate that h <dig> exerts both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing effects in choriocarcinoma cells, at least in part, by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. it has been hypothesized for many years that a potential tumor suppressor gene is present at chromosome 11p <dig> where h <dig> is located, because a loss of heterozygosity at this locus is observed in certain embryonal tumors <cit> . subsequent experiments implicated h <dig> may function as a tumor suppressor <cit> . however, other studies provided conflicting evidence that supported the idea that h <dig> rna harbors oncogenic properties <cit> . similar observations have been made in trophoblast tissue; some studies revealed that h <dig> has tumor-suppressing activity <cit> , while others suggested that it has tumor-promoting activity <cit> . therefore, h <dig> may play differential roles under different physiologic conditions. in the present study, we demonstrated that h <dig> knockdown could simultaneously inhibit the proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells, suggesting that h <dig> expression may have both proliferation-inducing and apoptosis-inducing activity in choriocarcinoma-derived cells. interestingly, a key event in tumorigenesis is the loss of equilibrium between cell proliferation and cell death <cit> . thus, our observation that h <dig> can simultaneously induce proliferation and apoptosis highlights a putative dual role of h <dig> in choriocarcinoma cell lines and may explain the debate over whether h <dig> is a tumor suppressor or a tumor promotor in trophoblast tissue. shoshani o et al. discovered that direct knockdown of h <dig> expression in diploid tumorigenic mouse mesenchymal stromal cells resulted in acquisition of polyploid cell traits. and artificial tetraploidization of diploid mscs reduces tumorigenic potential in conjunction with suppression of h <dig> expression. this establishs a link between h <dig> expression and cell ploidy. poluploidization might either have a cancer promoting or a cancer-preventing effect as is the case in aneuploidy <cit> . then, further experiments should determine whether the inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis by h <dig> knockdown is associated with the polyploidy of trophoblast cells. however, since the human choriocarcinoma cell line jar may already have a different h <dig> gene regulatory pattern from normal trophoblasts, the extrapolation of results from jar cells to the normal trophoblast must be cautious. further studies in normal trophoblast cells should be done to address this issue. like h <dig> igf <dig> is an imprinted gene and the two are closely linked. however, while h <dig> is expressed from the maternal allele, igf <dig> is transcribed from the paternal allele in most tissues <cit> . a growing body of evidence has indicated that h <dig> rna is a negative regulator of igf <dig> gabory et al. <cit> demonstrated that h <dig> transgenic or knockout mice developed abnormal phenotypes due to alterations in igf <dig> mrna levels. esquiliano et al. <cit> found that targeted disruption of the h <dig> gene in mice induced the placental phenotype via upregulation of igf <dig> expression. in the present study, we have demonstrated that h <dig> knockdown had no significant impact on the expression of igf <dig> mrna. nevertheless, this result is not too surprising because numerous studies have not been able to provide a consistent relationship between the expression levels and imprinting status of h <dig> and igf <dig> in all tissues. adam et al. <cit> discovered that h <dig> showed biallelic expression in extravillous cytotrophoblasts, while igf <dig> showed monoallelic expression. lustig-yariv et al. <cit> showed that h <dig> and igf- <dig> rna levels differed greatly among different jar or jeg- <dig> clones. moreover, we also found that both h <dig> and igf- <dig> rnas were highly expressed in normal term placenta and jeg- <dig> cells, and h <dig> overexpression did not alter igf <dig> expression in jeg- <dig> cells . therefore, these data suggest that igf <dig> may not be involved in h <dig> downregulation-mediated inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells. our results did show that h <dig> knockdown significantly upregulated expression of the hes- <dig> gene in jar cells. hes- <dig> gene is an important effector of the notch pathway that has been implicated in regulating the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in multiple tumor cell types. kunnimalaiyaan et al. <cit> found that increased hes- <dig> expression suppressed the proliferation of carcinoid tumor cells. nefedova et al. <cit> demonstrated that overexpression of hes- <dig> abrogated gamma-secretase inhibitor-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. importantly, we also found that h <dig> overexpression could downregulate the expression of hes- <dig> in jeg- <dig> cells . thus, we speculated that hes- <dig> may mediate h <dig> downregulation-induced suppression of proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells. although it remains unclear how h <dig> knockdown upregulates hes- <dig> expression in jar cells, the recent finding that h <dig> can negatively regulate an imprinted gene network may provide some clues to the mechanisms of regulation of hes- <dig> expression by h <dig> <cit> . furthermore, we demonstrated that h <dig> knockdown could also significantly upregulate the expression of dusp <dig> gene in jar cells. the dusp <dig> gene encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase . it has been shown that extracellular signal regulated kinase <dig> is a specific substrate of dusp <dig> <cit> . as erk <dig> plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, it is reasonable to surmise that dusp <dig> may also be involved in such processes. importantly, we also found that h <dig> overexpression could downregulate the expression of dusp <dig> in jeg- <dig> cells . therefore, dusp <dig> may also be involved in h <dig> downregulation-induced suppression of proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells. CONCLUSIONS the present study provides evidence that h <dig> knockdown does not alter invasion but inhibits proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells. the observation that h <dig> downregulation simultaneously suppresses proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells suggests a putative dual functionality of h <dig> in choriocarcinoma cell lines and may explain the debate over whether h <dig> is a tumor suppressor or a tumor promotor in trophoblast tissue. moreover, we also found that h <dig> knockdown upregulates the expression of the hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> genes but not of the igf- <dig> gene, suggesting that hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> may mediate h <dig> downregulation-induced suppression of proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells. abbreviations chm: complete hydatidiform moles; ddp: diamminedichloroplatinum; dmso: dimethyl sulfoxide; dusp5: dual-specific phosphatase 5; erk2: extracellular signal regulated kinase 2; gfp: green fluorescent protein; hes-1: hairy and enhancer of split homologue-1; igf2: insulin-like growth factor 2; loi: loss of imprinting; mkp: mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase; m-mlv: moloney murine leukemia virus; moi: multiplicity of infection; mtt: methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium; nc: negative control; pbs: phosphate buffered saline; pi: propidium iodide; rt-pcr: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; sirna: small interfering rna competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors’ contributions ll and mc contributed to the overall conceptual design and also analyzed the data, contributed to the interpretation of findings and wrote the first draft of the manuscript. ly and kc was the principal investigator and contributed with the idea, as well as to the interpretation of the results and the writing of the manuscript.cn, js, fm, lm, an, jk, gm, jo, lg, cr and bb were involved in the experiment of the study and revision of the manuscript. all authors have read and approved the final manuscript. supplementary material additional file 1: table s1 the structure of sirnas in lentiviral vectors. table s <dig> the ct values from quantitative pcr reactions. figure s1: effect of h <dig> knockdown on the invasion of jar cells. the invasion rate of cells in the h <dig> knockdown group and the nc group were <dig> % ± <dig> % and <dig> % ± <dig> %, respectively. h <dig> knockdown had no significant impact on the invasion rate of jar cells. click here for file acknowledgements we are grateful to wen zhao and xingyun chen for their technical assistance. this work was supported by a grant from the national natural science foundation of china.",

implicated in worldwide amphibian declines <cit> . although bd is able to infect a wide range of species and hence displays extreme host generality <cit> , amphibian morbidity and mortality in response to infection is highly variable and host-species specific <cit> . for example, while some studies report devastating consequences of bd infection <cit> , others have shown different levels of resistance to bd infection and have provided experimental evidence showing some species are able to clear bd infection <cit> . in several species, infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and inflammation have been reported on the skin of susceptible amphibians <cit> . histological examinations of resistant hosts have revealed that bd infections can cause skin injuries similar to those observed in susceptible species, albeit distributed more patchily on the skin <cit> . these results suggest that those amphibians that are apparently resistance to bd infection might still experience sub-lethal costs but whether any such costs are likely to impair traits associated with reproductive success and survival is unclear. it is well known that pathogens exert significant cost for the host <cit> . costs may be manifest through the host’s energetic and cellular response to the infection <cit> , through the pathogens acquisition of host resources, or through inducing greater host susceptibility to other pathogens <cit> . as such, hosts might show clinical symptoms and visible damage <cit> , but even where such effects are lacking, significant negative consequences can arise through reductions in investment in traits associated with fitness . as a consequence, in species exhibiting apparent resistance to bd, we might also expect there to be sub-lethal costs of infection and for such costs to influence populations. in support, a number of studies in frogs and toads have reported subclinical effects of bd on tadpole growth <cit> , as well as adult body size <cit> and body condition <cit> . nevertheless, in such cases, tests of the consequences of bd infection for traits important in reproduction of resistant amphibians are generally lacking. the palmate newt, lissotriton helveticus , is a common, semi-aquatic amphibian of western europe. palmate newts inhabit aquatic habitats with still or very slow-moving water during the breeding season, but otherwise have a terrestrial life style <cit> , occupying moist habitats and refugia <cit> . males develop large ornaments when they enter water for breeding, manifested as a low, straight edged crest which extends dorsally, a thread-like filament projecting from the end of the tail and conspicuous webbing between the toes of the hind feet <cit> . these secondary sexual characteristics have been shown to be associated with male reproductive success <cit> . they then gradually start to regress as the newts leave their aquatic habitat, but may not necessarily have fully disappeared as individuals start their migration to their terrestrial feeding <cit> . interestingly, palmate newts have been reported in several bd infected sites across europe and have been found to test positively for bd . despite this, no morbidity or mass mortality have been reported <cit> and under laboratory conditions, excessive weekly exposures to more than 106 bd zoospores per week for more than 4 weeks does not induce symptomatic chytridiomycosis even up to 40 days following a month-long exposure course . these observations suggest that this species exhibits some level of resistance to bd. however, the consequences of exposure to bd, which will most likely occur during the aquatic phase as a result of increased probability of exposure to waterborne bd zoospores, have not been investigated for this species. here, we inoculated a group of wild-caught palmate newts experimentally with a single dose of bd and monitored bd infection, survival and clinical symptoms, as well as changes in morphological and behavioural traits known to be associated with reproductive success in this species. our specific aim was to use this experiment to test: whether palmate newts become infected by exposure to low doses of bd, whether they show external symptoms and whether they are able to tolerate or clear the infection; the consequences of bd exposure and infection load for secondary sexual characters in males; the consequences of bd exposure and infection load for mass change in both males and females; and whether exposure to bd is associated with changes in the probability of an early entry into the terrestrial phase. throughout, we consider sex differences, where possible. methods in mid may <dig> <dig> newts in aquatic phase were captured in narrow streams on the borders of bouconne forest, haute garonne, france . our rationale for using wild-caught rather than laboratory-derived newts was that we wished to use individuals as close as possible to their natural state. the sites used are in a forest reserve with natural and man-made streams, and are located about 100 km outside the current extent of the known bd infection zone. in addition, our inspections for bd in this area since <dig> have failed to detect evidence of bd infection of any amphibian species in the area, and all animals brought back to the laboratory tested negative for bd. male and female newts were randomly paired and transferred into plastic tanks . our reason for this is that wished to examine the effects of bd exposure on male secondary sexual characteristics, which we considered to be likely influenced by the presence of a female. each tank contained <dig> litre of aged tap water and a hollow brick for shelter. we randomly assigned tanks to one of <dig> treatment groups: controls and bd-exposed . all newts were maintained in the laboratory for 7 days prior to experimentation and were provided with live midge larvae , daphnia and/or tubifex every two days. food was provided by ‘sucking’ a known quantity of liquid containing roughly <dig> larvae. although the precise number of larvae was unknown, there is no reason to suppose this varied systematically between experimentally exposed and control tanks. room temperature was maintained at <dig> ± <dig> °c throughout the experiment. light exposure was adjusted weekly to equal the average day length of the first and of the last days of the focal week . water was changed 3 days after inoculation and then weekly thereafter to prevent bacterial blooms in the tank. this also means that levels of bd loads detected were unlikely to be explained by zoospore survival in the water <cit> . bd cultures were prepared from a bd extract of an infected tadpole from an introduced population of american bullfrog in southern france . this extract was grown in <dig> % trypton and <dig> g × l- <dig> glucose in ultrapure water. cultures were incubated at <dig> °c to optimize growth of the fungus <cit> . approximately one hour prior to inoculation, we counted approximately <dig> active zoospores × ml- <dig> of the 5th passage of our culture using a haemocytometer. we then added 12 ml of this culture to each bd exposed tank . the experiment was stopped 30 days post-inoculation, when about approximately half of the newts had entered or were entering the terrestrial phase of the season . when a newt consistently remained out of the water for five consecutive days, we considered the day the newt had left the water for the first time as the start of t-phase. animal capture was with permission of the prefecture of haute garonne . animal housing facility and experiments comply with the regulations of the housing organization and the current rules of france. infection was detected by quantitative amplification of bd-dna content of weekly swab samples using fine tip dry swabs . swab samples were taken at upon arrival, day <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> after the first inoculation from all individuals. quantitative pcr’s were conducted as described in <cit> , and after incorporating the changes suggested by kriger et al. and hyatt et al. <cit> except that the we reduced the final volume of reactions to 10 μl due to higher sensitivity of our q-pcr machine . throughout this paper, results of all quantifications are presented in bd genome equivalent per swab bout. in addition to standard duplicates and negative controls, we also included 6– <dig> samples of control newts in each test plates of exposed samples and utilized internal positive control reagent in all samples . to ensure the efficiency of inoculations, we also analysed swab samples of <dig> individuals of the same population, after <dig> weekly exposures to <dig> zoospores of the same bd strain. the average bd load of these newts, one week after the second inoculation, was <dig> ± <dig> bdge, showing the bd strain and inoculation method was able to generate an infection in this population. on days <dig> and <dig> post-inoculation, we measured body mass using a digital scale . snout-to-vent length and male secondary sexual traits were measured by imagej software on digital photographs of all individuals: area of tail crest, length of tail filament, and average of webbed area of hind feet one day before inoculation and day <dig> after inoculation, according to <cit> . photographs were taken on a single plastic board with a millimetre scaled area of 2 × 10 cm. all morphological measurements were taken twice by the same person and their average was used in statistical analyses. in all cases a strong correlation was observed between replicates. finally, we recorded survival, and the start of t-phase as well as symptoms of clinical chytridiomycosis <cit> . infection patterns and symptoms changes in the probability of being infected during the experiment were analysed by fitting whether or not a newt was infected on a given day as the response term in generalized linear mixed-effects model with a binomial error structure and logit link function. the binomial denominator and dispersion parameters were <dig> changes to infection loads during the course of the experiment, were analysed using a glmm with poisson error structure and log-link function in which load size was fitted as the response term. in both models, individual subjects’ codes nested within box number were fitted as random terms to account for repeated sampling of each. the svl and body mass of individuals on day zero were fitted as covariates, while sex, days after the first inoculations and their interaction were fitted as fixed effects. finally, throughout the experiment we examined the animals for signs to bd-mediated symptoms. secondary sexual characteristics in males analysis of change in male secondary sexual characters over the course of the experiment was conducting using multivariate analysis of variance, in order to account for multiple correlated terms of interest . the changes in each trait were fitted as the response terms, while proportional mass change was fitted as a covariate to account for changes in body condition, and treatment was fitted as a the fixed effect of interest. because in this case we only used a single measure from a single individual from each box , there was no need to conduct a mixed model in this analysis. mass loss in males and females the effect of bd on mass was investigated in two ways. first, an analysis of the effect of treatment on mass change was conducted by fitting mass change between day <dig> and <dig> as the response term in a general linear model with normal errors. body length and mass at experimental onset were fitted as covariates, while sex and treatment were fitted as the primary fixed effects of interest, along with their interaction. second, an analysis of the effect of bd-load change during the course of the experiment on mass change was conducted in the same way, but wherein treatment was swapped for load change among exposed individuals. because both of these analyses included a male and a female from the same box, it could be argued that such pairings are not independent units. however, initial residual maximum likelihood models fitting box number as a random term showed that the box from which individuals were obtained had a negative component of variance, indicating that the variation within boxes was indistinguishable from that between boxes. we therefore elected for the more parsimonious glm rather than reml approach, since the results were almost identical and the former allows estimation of variance explained. terrestrial phase the probability that individuals initiated t-phase within the 30-day experimental period was investigated by fitting whether or not individuals entered t-phase as the response term using two glms with binomial error structures with logit link functions. in the first case, treatment was fitted as the primary factor of interest, and in the second, treatment was replaced by bd-load. in each case, body length and mass at experimental onset were fitted as covariates, and sex was fitted as an additional factor. in both analyses, we investigated the effect of tank identity in glmms, but in both cases it represented a negative component of variance. all statistics were conducted in genstat release <dig> . the statistics are provided for all terms included in the models, and effect sizes ± standard errors are provided for terms of interest. terms were dropped from models when their exclusion failed to generate a significant loss of model variance. all p values provided are two-tailed. RESULTS infection patterns and symptoms at experimental onset, all newts tested negative for bd, but following exposure to bd, 94% of individuals became infected. of these, most became infected in the first week, although 4% became infected by the end of week two and 2% were found to be infected at the end of week three. only 4% of newts remained infected 30 days after the onset of the experiment. as a consequence, the probability that individuals were infected with bd changed substantially during the course of the month-long experiment . larger newts were less likely to be infected on a given day , but there was no effect of initial body mass and no differences between the sexes on patterns of infection. over the course of the experiment, bd loads ranged from 0– <dig> bdge per swab. newts that were long had reduced loads on average , but there was no effect of body mass at the onset of the experiment and no difference between the sexes . as with the incidence data above, bd loads varied dramatically throughout the month-long experiment: in both sexes, bd loads were at their maximum seven days after inoculation and declined to zero after a month . the results above suggest that palmate newts are resistant to bd. in support, we found no evidence to suggest that bd induces mortality or visible clinical symptoms in the captive palmate newts. during the course of our 30-day study, only three newts died. two infected newts died 15 days post-inoculation, and one control did so 24 days following the onset of the experiment. prior to their death, none of the exposed newts showed symptoms of clinical chytridiomycosis, such as skin lesions, haemorrhage, or absence of righting reflex <cit> . bd contents of swab samples taken the day before of death of the two treated newts were <dig> and <dig> bdge in female and male individual, respectively. secondary sexual characteristics in males male palmate newts show three obvious morphological characteristics during the aquatic breeding phase. at experimental onset, the mean crest area, tail filament length and hind food webbing area were <dig> mm <dig> <dig> mm, <dig> mm <dig> respectively. the onset of the experiment was timed to coincide with the peak breeding season and hence the maximum extent of male secondary sexual characteristic sizes. during the course of the experiment, crest and hind food web area declined by 37% and 31%, respectively, while tail filament was reduced in length by 68% . a multivariate analysis of variance revealed that after controlling for the proportion of mass lost , there was an overall effect of treatment on the reduction of the extent of secondary sexual characteristics . however, univariate anovas showed that this overall effect was driven entirely by the effect of bd treatment on a reduction of the loss of hind food web area . mass loss in males and females at the time of capture, females were slightly longer than males = <dig> ± <dig> vs. <dig> ± <dig> mm: t-test, t66 = <dig> , p < <dig> ), but there was no difference in their respective masses . individuals that were heavy at experimental onset lost significantly more mass over the 30-day experiment than those that were light , but there was no effect of body length . after controlling for significant effects of the former, we found that exposed newts lost 33% more mass than control newts, with treatment explaining <dig> % of the variation in mass change during the experiment . males and females lost similar amounts of mass and the effect of experimental treatment on mass loss did not differ between the sexes . the results above suggest that palmate newts suffer a cost of clearing bd from their system. however, a better test of this hypothesis is to investigate the relationship between the change in bd load and the change in mass over the course of the experiment. the mass lost by experimental newts increased as a function of increasing body mass at the onset of the experiment , but was uninfluenced by svl . after controlling for the effects of mass at experimental onset, we found a significant negative relationship with bd load change and mass loss, with newts losing 5% of their body mass for every four bdge’s that they cleared . this effect was common to both males and females . terrestrial phase overall, 46% of newts were judged to have entered t-phase by the end of the 30-day experiment. there were non-significant tendencies for males to enter t-phase after females and those in poor body condition to enter t-phase before those in good condition . after controlling for these effects, we found that exposed newts were 50% more likely to enter into t-phase during the 30-day experiment that control newts . within the exposed individuals, males and females had a similar probability of entering into t-phase . there was no effect of body length on the probability of entering t phase , but those individuals in poor conditions were more likely to enter the t-phase than those in better condition . after controlling for these effects, we found that newts were more likely to enter t-phase if they had high average bd loads during the first three weeks of the experiment, independently of sex . discussion our results suggest that the bd dose administered is capable of inducing a subclinical infection in the palmate newt within one to two weeks after inoculation. we found no evidence to suggest that bd caused signs of chytridiomycosis <cit> or death, and indeed, virtually all exposed newts appeared to have cleared any infection by one month post-inoculation. these results complement circumstantial field evidence documenting that in bd areas, palmate newts appear not to suffer mass mortality . nevertheless, our evidence also suggest that such apparent resistance to bd comes at a cost of increased mass loss during the aquatic phase and a more rapid transition to terrestrial t-phase compared to non-exposed controls. within exposed newts, both the amount of mass lost and probability of entering t-phase increased as a function of increasing pathogen load clearance. by contrast, the rate of loss of secondary sexual characteristics were generally not influenced by bd infection, with the exception of hind foot webbing that remained longer in exposed newts than controls. while the devastating impacts of bd on amphibians are well publicised <cit> , much less is known about the extent, form and underlying causes of more subtle symptoms in apparently resistant amphibian species. our results suggest that caution should be exercised before concluding that bd has negligible consequences for apparently resistant species. bd is known to invade the host epidermis; feeding on various nutrients , causing pathological abnormalities and impairing critical cutaneous functions, such as the maintenance of osmotic balance . although bd infection can have devastating consequences , accumulating evidence suggests that some amphibians only exhibit subclinical symptoms and might be able to effectively clear the infection through mechanisms such as antimicrobial peptides <cit> , bd killing microbial flora on their skin <cit> , anti-bd immunoglobulin’s <cit> , increasing body temperature during the infection <cit> and improvements to dietary condition <cit> . in such circumstances, individuals might still suffer costs: because pathogens impair body functioning; because mounting an immune response or repairing damaged tissues requires energy; because pathogens actually consume host energy resources; and/or because immune-associated illness-induced anorexia reduces energy intake <cit> . for instance, in wild frog populations, bd infection has found to be associated with smaller body size <cit> , although the mechanism causing the reduction in body size in these frog studies was unclear. the evidence for our study suggests that increased mass loss might be mediated by a cost of immunity <cit> , but verification of this as a specific mechanism needs elucidating through more targeted experimentation in our and other studies. for example, we are not able to rule out a role of adaptive anorexia, but we suggest that such an effect is unlikely to explain our results fully, since newts were not fed adlib and we noticed no obvious surplus of food in experimental tanks. indeed, that a recent study has shown experimentally that mounting an innate immune response against bd comes at cost to host body condition <cit> , provides some tentative support for our conclusions. we found little evidence to suggest that the regression of secondary sexual characteristics were hastened by exposure to bd, but we found some support for the possibility that breeding season duration might be curtailed. both the regression of sexually selected characteristics and transition into t-phase are thought to be largely under hormonal control <cit> . although, we were not able to measure neuroendocrine changes of the exposed and infected newts, our results fit well with the current knowledge of amphibians’ stress responses and its impacts on reproduction. in amphibians, exposure to pathogens can cause a rapid release of anti-microbial peptides <cit> through activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis <cit> . stimulation of this axis can result in inhibition of production and release of stress hormone <cit> which, in urodeles, inhibits the courtship behaviour, development/maintenance of male secondary sexual traits and triggers the migration toward the terrestrial habitat <cit> . at the behavioural level, a decrease of prolactin triggers the termination of aquatic phase and migration toward terrestrial habitat while at a morphological level the decrease of prolactin induces the decline of tail crest <cit> . however, the decline of hind feet webbing is mediated by a different mechanism which involves a synergetic effect of several hormones <cit> . therefore, the slowed reduction of hind feet webbings, in comparison to tail crest and tail filament, might be due to the difference of the hormonal bases which control these traits. in order to elucidate the potential mechanisms of slowed regression of foot webbing as well as early entry into t-phase, more studies are required. in addition, in order to understand the potential consequences, the exact role and relative importance of each sexually selected trait in female choice is required, as is the consequences of the size of each trait for survival on transition to the t-phase. although, for obvious ethical and conservation reasons, we were unable to measure the consequences of experimental infection for individual fitness in the wild, we suggest the consequences of bd that we observed are likely to be significant <cit> . in palmate newts, mating success is likely to be influenced by the duration of their aquatic phase, and is known to be condition-dependent: female fecundity and male display rate are both highly demanding energetically <cit> . it is also highly probable that the success of terrestrial migrations are at least partly associated with having sufficient energy reserves as is the ability to survive winter hibernation, since the annual rate of survival of newts is fairly low and newts consume almost all their resources during the winter <cit> . our ability to project the population consequences of sub-lethal infections requires an understanding of whether or not individuals can acquire adaptive immunity to bd or whether individuals with primed immune system remain susceptible to bd. where the former is the case, we would expect bd to have little impact on palmate newt’s populations once resistance spreads in the populations . on the other hand, if the latter is true, the sub-lethal consequences observed in this study are likely to have more significant population consequences, with possible impairment of female fecundity, juvenile recruitment and adult survival. currently, it is unclear whether amphibian species that suffer subclinical effects of bd are declining, as one might expect from our results. we urge that future studies are careful to monitor population sizes of all amphibian species in a given area, and attempt to determine whether bd can also have population consequences, even for apparently resistant species. further, in the advent of such declines being apparent, it is important to determine whether such declines are generated through biased effects on each sex or age class. CONCLUSIONS the costs of pathogen infection are common and include a range of sub-lethal symptoms including reduced growth, increased mass loss, increased metabolic rate and/or a readjustment of life history strategies <cit> . our results suggest that subclinical costs of bd infection can exert significant costs on an apparently resistant host amphibian, with potential threatening consequences on long term population viability. indeed, bd infected palmate newts suffered from a decrease in body condition relative to controls and had delayed absorption of one temporary adaptations for aquatic life; both of which might impede the success of terrestrial migration. in addition, they showed earlier initiation of t-phase, which might reduce the duration of a breeding season, and hence the number of offspring produced by a given population. furthermore, in addition to the general inhibitory effects of stress on amphibian reproduction, chronic exposure to bd zoospores in the aquatic habitat may trigger a chronic activation of the stress axis which might increase an individual’s susceptibility to other pathogens as well as other environmental stressors. further studies are required in this species and other apparently asymptomatic species, in order to further appreciate the extent, form and mechanism of sub-lethal costs of bd infection in amphibian species. competing interests the authors confirm that this work is not a subject of financial and non-financial competing interests. authors’ contributions hc conceived and conducted the experiments with help from ap. the analyses were performed and the paper was written by hc, afr and cb. all authors read and approved the final manuscript.",

therefore the paired-end sequencing data has the potential to increase the accuracy of identification of chromosome binding sites of dna-associated proteins because the fragment length as well as the effective genome length can be computed accurately. here we describe a novel algorithm, sipes , which can be used to effectively mine the paired-end sequencing reads for genome-wide identification of binding sites by calculating fragment pileup values at each nucleotide position. then a dynamic baseline, a background model and other user-set thresholds are used to find the binding sites. we demonstrate the utility of this algorithm with a chip-seq data set generated using the solexa platform for genome-wide binding analysis of a transcription factor aborted microspores . ams belongs to a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, which is required for tapetal cell development and the post-meiotic microspore formation in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . using an in vitro selection and amplification binding assay, the recombinant ams fusion protein was shown to bind to the 6-bp consensus bhlh binding dna motif sequence canntg, typically referred to as the e-box <cit> . the performance of sipes was compared to two algorithms, cisgenome and macs, used for reporting specific binding motifs and revealed that sipes has better resolution for binding sites discovery. methods chromatin immunoprecipitation the procedure for chip of ams-dna complexes in the wild-type arabidopsis anther was modified from that of saleh et al <cit> . chromatin was isolated from <dig> g of formaldehyde cross-linked tissue from <dig> - <dig> mm buds of plants showing ams expression <cit> . for immunoprecipitation, we used a specific polyclonal ams antibody, which in western blot analysis, interacts exclusively with the ams protein and shows no interaction with the ams mutant <cit> . dataset since there is no public released paired-end chip-seq data, we generated a chip-seq library from an ams ip sample using a specific ams polyclonal antibody <cit> on chromatin isolated from arabidopsis thaliana buds. the aligned sequence reads for ams are available in the gene expression omnibus with accession number gsm <dig> library preparation, linker annealing, amplification, and gel purification for around <dig> ng chip dna were performed as instructed by the illumina protocol with small modifications <cit> . gel purification and size selection for dna fragments between <dig> and <dig> bp were done after the amplification step. software availability sipes is implemented in c and will be freely available for non-profit use of most genomes . the source code and its executable file are available at http://gmdd.shgmo.org/computational-biology/chip-seq/download/sipes. users can compile sipes with the command line 'gcc -lm -o <dig> -s -g -o sipes sipes.c'. sipes runs from the command line and takes the following parameter: -bs for dynamic baseline start to construct the signal map, signal map means the picture of fragment pileup value at each nucleotide position; -be for dynamic baseline end to construct the signal map; -p for p-value cutoff to call peaks; -f for fold-enrichment to find signal maps based on the poisson model. two types of files can be produced by sipes. one type generates signal coordinates and the pileup value of fragments from each chromosome. the other file includes signal start, signal end, signal width, reads in signal, max fragment pileup value, summit start, summit end, summit middle, summit width, p-value, and fold-enrichment of each signal map. here, summit means the location with a single global maximum fragment pileup value in the signal map. modeling the dna fragments of paired-end reads paired-end sequencing technology generates large numbers of reads derived from both the 5' and 3' ends of fragmented dna in a chip-seq library. using the illumina solexa platform <dig> million 40-bp sequence reads were obtained from the ams ip sample. from these data, <dig> , <dig> end- <dig> reads and <dig> , <dig> end- <dig> reads were uniquely mapped onto the arabidopsis genome <cit> by ssaha <dig> <cit> , allowing a maximum of one mismatch and no gaps in either end- <dig> or end- <dig> when the corresponding sequences mates aligned over a range of <dig> to <dig> bp. this process can also be used by other mapping software which supports the paired-end reads such as maq <cit> and bowtie <cit> . each pair of the sequenced reads is allocated a unique 'token' , that allows the precise identification of each corresponding dna fragment. using the mapped paired-end reads coordinate chromosome information, the start and end position of each fragment can be easily extracted via the preprocessing program of sipes . the precise location of each fragment in the reference genome is determined and these fragments are used as the sipes input. RESULTS calculation of the effective genome size the paired-end sequencing technology generates double-end reads with unique tokens that can be used to determine the dna fragment's location and their corresponding length using sipes. using the preprocessing program of sipes, the effective genome size, which is the genome coverage calculated based on uniquely mapped reads, within the arabidopsis genome is <dig> , <dig> bp, which accounts for about 93% of the whole genome length in our ams experiment . sipes algorithm sipes uses the fragment's start position and end position to identify binding sites and its algorithm is overviewed in figure <dig> briefly, the fragments are extracted by using the start and end positions defined in 'chromosome i'. then fragment pileup value is calculated based on the sorted fragments in 'chromosome i' . subsequently, a dynamic baseline is used to cut off the bottom of peaks to identify potential binding sites. here baseline means the fragment pileup value when start to construct the signal map. sipes is able to construct signal maps ranging from baseline <dig> to t; t refers to the maximum baseline which can be set by users. after all the signal maps are constructed, sipes evaluates whether each signal map satisfies a set of user-determined thresholds for finding the true binding events. the probability of detecting a binding site within a signal width w supported by at least c reads by chance based on its baseline is given by a sum of poisson distribution <cit> as: where tpn means the total number of paired-end reads , gs means the mappable genome size which is <dig> , <dig> bp in our ams experiment, and the ratio between c and w reported as the fold-enrichment . sipes also allows users to use their input dna as background. then false discovery rate can be calculated using n1/n <dig> here n <dig> means the peak number that called by sipes when using chip over input dna, and n <dig> means the peak number that called by sipes when using input dna over chip with the same cutoff as n <dig> then , where i means input dna reads count in a signal width w and c means ip reads count in w, also r is the normalization ratio of total ip reads count and total input dna reads count sequenced by the illumina solexa platform. candidate signal maps with p below a user-defined threshold p-value and fold above a threshold fold-enrichment are called if baseline = t, or the signal maps with a single global maximum when baseline <t. since the signal maps are constructed ranging from baseline <dig> to t, some candidate signal maps may have the same global maximum positions; sipes finally records a peak with the highest signal map value fold from the same 'global maximum position' as one binding site. and then all the called regions are ranked based on the fold. method comparisons sipes processes the data of paired-end sequencing by piling up the fragments in the genome. although the updated macs system supports the paired-end mode <cit> , current publically available chip-seq algorithms are mainly targeting to single-end sequencing data. these existing chip-seq peak finding methods generally predict peaks by estimating the fragment length to predict the peak shift and use tag density within a window when dealing with the sequencing data. here we compared sipes analysis with two publicly available chip-seq peak finding methods, cisgenome <cit> and macs <cit> . the mapped <dig> , <dig> end- <dig> and <dig> , <dig> end- <dig> reads with the same effective genome size were used for analysis using cisgenome and macs software. the depth of ams chip-seq is comparable with those used by other algorithms such as <dig> million chip tags for nrsf, <dig> million for ctcf of human in macs <cit> . moreover, human genome size is about <dig> times larger than arabidopsis. the data generated by macs were compared with those of sipes using the single-end and paired-end modes of macs. a total of <dig> putative ams binding sites were identified using sipes , whilst only <dig> binding sites were determined using the macs paired-end mode , and <dig> binding sites using the macs single-end mode . we calculated the percentage of peaks harboring the ams binding motif within <dig> bp of the peak center, and observed that sipes generated a higher percentage of peaks containing the ams binding motif than those of cisgenome, macs single-end mode and macs paired-end mode . the spatial resolution is expressed by the average distance from the peak center to the nearest ams motif. we observed that the average distance from the peak center to the nearest ams motif by sipes was shorter than those of cisgenome, macs single-end mode and macs paired-end mode, suggesting that sipes system has a better spatial resolution . collectively, these results suggested that sipes is able to find peaks with better resolution for binding motif discovery. discussion effective genomic size is an important parameter for the calculation of p-value, and the fact that the sipes analysis can calculate fragment length and effective genomic size accurately using the reads from paired-end sequencing means that it can provide enhanced identification of dna-protein binding sites from chip-seq data. currently, most of the available algorithms can not accurately calculate the fragment size because they are mainly designed for single-end chip-seq data analysis, which usually uses the direction of reads to estimate the fragment length to identify binding sites <cit> . the paired-end sequencing technology generates double-end reads with unique tokens that can be used to calculate fragment length using sipes. moreover, sipes can calculate the accurate effective genomic size using the advantage of the accurate fragment length. other algorithms, such as macs recommend that the effective genome size of hg <dig> is about 90% of the whole genome length <cit> while sissrs recommends about 80% <cit> and findpeaks suggests about 70% <cit> . however this estimation is likely to affect the accuracy of the analysis for researchers who use the chip-seq technology. in this study, an effective genomic size of <dig> , <dig> bp of ams enriched dna was observed using the sipes preprocessing program, which accounts for approximately 93% of the arabidopsis whole genome length. in addition, sipes calculates the dna-protein binding sites on basis of the analysis of fragment pileup which is more intuitive and creditable, while most of the existing algorithms are based on the tag counts to test the enrichment. currently, most peak finding methods often employ a window scan for the whole genome with a step to calculate the read count and see if that can satisfy the statistical tests. varying window size and step length may therefore cause differences in the results. sipes can determine peak end and start positions based on a dynamic baseline while other algorithms sometimes incorrectly split a true peak into two or more peaks. in addition, sipes uses a dynamic baseline to discriminate closely adjacent binding sites to easily separate adjacent overlapping peaks. for example, if a baseline of <dig> is used, two closely adjacent signal map a and map b are misrepresented as a single peak . but if a higher baseline is adopted, map a and map b are identified . sipes can also analyze broad peaks with high signal levels while a peak of the same shape but of lower signal value with low signal values would have every local maxima . for example, one peak with the summit <dig> will be called when the baseline is below <dig> and satisfies the p-value cutoff set by the user. when the baseline is increased to <dig> then two peaks, one merging peak and peak <dig> will be called. when the baseline is increased to <dig> three peaks will be called . if the low signal value is not high enough to satisfy the p-value cutoff, then only broad peaks with higher signal will be called. therefore by utilizing a dynamic baseline, sipes can theoretically find all the signal maps with a single global maximum , this is of particular importance for high-density genomes which may have a number of binding sites in close proximity. we found that motif occurrence percentage is higher when t is increased from <dig> to <dig> which mean peak results will be better with a high t value; suggesting t is a good indicator of finding binding sites . also, peak number tends to be stable when t is increased using sipes, therefore users can find more genuine dna-protein binding sites by increasing the t value . from analysis of our ams chip-seq data, we recommend the users to choose as high a value for t as possible since this will allow the peaks to be identified more accurately, even though it may take more time to achieve this goal. at the same time, sipes is able to report the percentage of peaks with a single global maximum based on t set by users which can judge whether t is set reasonable. similar to the limitation of existing algorithms, sipes is not suitable for peak finding in a wide peak region such as those histone marks, since the statistical tests are not capable of satisfying the user's threshold . additionally, sipes algorithm is targeting to paired-end sequencing reads, and not applicable for single-end sequencing data. CONCLUSIONS in this paper we present an algorithm sipes that can be used for calculation of the effective genome size and precise identification of binding sites from short reads generated from paired-end solexa chip-seq technology. in comparison with two existing algorithms cisgenome and macs, we conclude that sipes has better resolution for binding sites identification. moreover, the dynamic baseline used in sipes can effectively discriminate between closely adjacent dna-protein binding sites, which is of particular value when working with high-density genomes. authors' contributions cmw and jx contributed equally to this work. cmw and dbz conceived the strategies. dbz supervised the project. cmw built the software. jx, dsz and zaw performed ams chip and data analysis. dbz, cmw, jx and zaw wrote the paper. supplementary material additional file 1 sipes algorithm for calculating fragment pileup value after sort fragments by start position on chromosome i. click here for file additional file 2 signal map with fragment pileup value determination using a dynamic baseline in sipes. when the baseline is below <dig> one peak c would be observed by sipes, when the baseline is <dig> peak a and peak b are observed. this scheme shows that sipes has the ability to accurately locate the dna-protein binding sites using the dynamic baseline. one peak with the summit <dig> will be called when the baseline is below <dig> and satisfies the p-value cutoff set by the user. when the baseline is increased to <dig> then two peaks, one merging peak and peak <dig> will be called. when the baseline is increased to <dig> three peaks, will be called. click here for file acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge b meyers for critically reading the manuscript, b han for paired-end sequencing. this work was supported by the funds from the national key basic research developments program of the ministry of science and technology, pr china , national '863' high-tech project , national natural science foundation of china , and shanghai leading academic discipline project .",

    "prompt": "Summarize this clinical report for a busy practitioner. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND pfam is a comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, with a range of well-established information including genome annotation. each family in pfam is represented by two multiple sequence alignments and two profile-hidden markov models <cit> . pfam has two large series of functionally uncharacterized families, known as domains of unknown function and uncharacterized protein families . dufs are families that have been created by pfam whereas upfs are those created by swiss-prot and added to pfam <cit> . the protein structure initiative- <dig> has undertaken the task of structurally characterizing all pfam families that have no structural representation. the pfam protein family duf <dig> consists of <dig> proteins of unknown function, <dig> from bacteria and <dig> from archaebacteria <cit> . herein, we report the first crystal structures of duf <dig> family members, including q9rxe <dig> from deinococcus radiodurans and q9l0t <dig> streptomyces coelicolor and show that they are remarkably similar to pfam family duf <dig> RESULTS the structure of 10093b was determined to <dig> Å resolution using selenium-sad . the final refined model of 10093b contains <dig> protomers, <dig> sulfate ions, and <dig> water molecules. the final refined model of 10093f contains <dig> protomers and <dig> water molecules. despite low sequence identity , the polypeptide chain structures are very similar . the two structures superimpose well with a rmsd of <dig> Å for <dig> α-carbon atomic pairs, excluding a loop region between val <dig> to ser <dig> in 10093b that does not occur in 10093f . this region is absent in all other sequences shown in figure <dig> except in thermus thermophilus . values for the highest resolution shell are given within parentheses. 1rmerge = Σ|ii-⟨i⟩|/Σ|ii| where ii is the intensity of the ith measurement, and ⟨i⟩ is the mean intensity for that reflection. 2phasing power and 3fom as defined in sharp. 4rfactor = Σ||fobs|-|fcalc||/Σ|fobs| where |fcalc| and |fobs| are the calculated and observed structure factor amplitudes, respectively. notwithstanding the similarity of the two polypeptide chain folds, mr attempts with various 10093b-derived search models were not successful. molecular replacement may have failed because of low sequence identity and/or due to the presence of multiple protomers within the asymmetric unit. biologically active units 10093b eight monomers a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h found in the asymmetric unit form four tightly packed dimers . each dimer pair superimposes very well on the remaining three with rmsds = <dig> Å– <dig> Å for all α-carbon atomic pairs. a dimer interface analysis performed using pdbsum <cit> demonstrated that each pair buries ~ <dig> Å <dig> of solvent accessible surface area , a value higher than would be found typically in interacting surfaces for a protein of this size <cit> . at least <dig> residues from each half of the dimer participate in intermolecular interactions. there are <dig> direct hydrogen bonded interactions between the protein atoms across the dimer interface. such a tight dimer interface suggests that the 10093b dimer is functional, which is supported by the results of analytical gel filtration . 10093f four monomers a, b, c, and d found in the crystallographic asymmetric unit occur as two dimers , albeit with an intermolecular packing arrangement that differs from that seen for 10093b. each observed 10093f dimer pair buries ~ <dig> Å <dig> of solvent accessible surface area, which is not thought to be significant for a protein of this size. moreover, the gel-filtration analysis revealed that 10093f is a monomer in solution. in the 10093b dimer, glu <dig> from the atypical val166-ser <dig> loop makes one of the six hydrogen bonds present in the dimer interface while three other residues in the same loop contribute to van der waals interactions. we suggest that the atypical loop found in 10093b may help support dimerization. the absence of this loop in 10093f may explain the monomeric solution behavior of this family member. structure and sequence relationships and homology modeling in an effort to annotate the function of these two related proteins, bioinformatics analysis with the experimental structures was performed using dali <cit> . for 10093b, a dali search revealed only two structural matches with a z-score greater than <dig> the closest match, af <dig> from archaeoglobus fulgidus , a protein of unknown function belonging to pfam duf <dig> gave a z-score of <dig> with sequence identity of 15% and rmsd of <dig> Å between <dig> structurally equivalent α-carbon atomic pairs. thus, structure determination of 10093b not only provided the first structural information for the pfam family duf <dig> it also documented unexpected structural similarity to a member of the duf <dig> pfam family that could not have been reliably predicted from sequence comparisons alone. a dali search with 10093f revealed significant matches with af <dig> z-score <dig> , as expected, and with a nitrate transport protein z-score of <dig> with sequence identity of 12% and rmsd between <dig> structurally equivalent α-carbon atomic pairs of <dig> Å. stereoviews of the superimposed polypeptide chains of 10093b over 10093f-monomers, -dimers and 10093b over 1zbm are presented in figure 3a, 3b and 3c respectively. a blast <cit> search of uniprot protein sequence database using the sequences of both 10093b and 10093f yielded <dig> matches . virtually all of the matches are identified as bacterial or archaeal hypothetical proteins. the three exceptions are as follows: a sam-dependent methyltransferase from lactococcus lactis , leucyl-trna synthetase from xanthomonas campestris , d-alanine-d-alanine ligase from nitrosomonas europaea . at the time of publication, the experimental structures of 10093b and 10093f were used as a template to compute homology models of <dig> proteins with related sequences with the modweb server <cit> . the <dig> models out of <dig> had sequence identity of great than 30%. active site/ligand binding site prediction active site/ligand binding site prediction performed using castp <cit> revealed two major clefts on the surfaces of the 10093b and 10093f . further analysis of these surface features together with a multiple sequence alignment performed in clustalw <cit> and edited in bioedit <cit> performed for 10093b reveals the presence of most of the conserved residues, including asn <dig> pro <dig> ser <dig> ser <dig> ser <dig> ile <dig> gly <dig> and asp <dig> . we suggest that this larger cleft represents the active site and/or ligand binding site for this functionally uncharacterized pfam family. prediction of putative function 10093b and 10093f belonging to duf <dig> family have remarkable similarity to duf <dig> protein family and a nitrate-binding protein . this similarity was not evident from sequence comparison alone. moreover, the uncharacterized duf <dig> family of proteins is annotated to be putative solute-binding protein. our analysis of the surface clefts shows that the major cleft identified in 10093b is common to all of them, the size being nearly the same. the binding pocket of 10093b superposes well with that of nitrate-binding protein. further analysis of the active site shows that the entry of this cavity is occupied by hydrophobic residues as in 2g <dig> <cit> . in 10093b, the residual density in the difference fourier showed a dumb bell shaped density and was modeled as water. this could very well be an unidentified ion. based on the comparison of structures and binding sites, we predict that this protein could be a solute binding protein, though we cannot at this stage identify the nature of the ion. the weak homology implies that it may be a different kind of solute. CONCLUSIONS the structure determination of 10093b and 10093f has revealed the unexpected similarity between duf <dig> and duf <dig> family of proteins suggesting that the information from three-dimensional structures along with the sequence information will predict the family of proteins of similar functions more reliably. we have predicted the protein to be a solute-binding protein based on structure and binding cavity. fold and structural similarity among proteins with low sequence identity is not uncommon. one prominent example would be proteins classified into different pfams but with the same tim barrel fold <cit> . amidohydrolases with low sequence homology have various substrate specificities and different enzymatic functions but all of them have similar fold. these belong to different pfam families but are grouped together as a super family <cit> . this also suggests that duf <dig> and duf <dig> though belonging to different pfams of unknown functions, may be members of the same superfamily.",

    "prompt": "Extract and summarize the diagnostic conclusions from this report. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND cell transformation is a process, which requires a highly coordinated change of gene expression and subsequent structural changes of cell architecture and metabolism. first changes typically occur within very short periods of time <cit> , indicating that response to external stimuli initializes changes of protein activity as well as changes of protein amount via removal or de novo synthesis. for the regulation of protein quantity, two mechanisms are responsible: control of mrna steady state levels by transcription and degradation, and protein synthesis by translation. there are several mechanisms known to influence transcriptional activity, the survival of mrnas or the efficiency by which they are translated into protein <cit> . for translation, ribosomes attach to mature mrnas. the more ribosomes are attached to mrna, the more efficiently it is translated. to increase protein de novo synthesis, either an increase in mrna abundance or an increase in ribosomes attached to the mrna is required <cit> . a motif typically found in the 5′-utr of ribosomal protein mrnas, whose translation efficiency upon stimulation depends on growth conditions, is the terminal oligopyrimidine tract motif <cit> . we applied a method to measure changes in the abundance of free mrnas, i.e. without any ribosomes attached, and polysomal mrnas, i.e. with one or more ribosomes attached, within the first six hours of adipogenesis in 3t3-l <dig> cells, a widely used model for the study of adipogenesis and function of adipocytes . adipogenesis is a complex process, and a number of factors are important for its regulation. many genes are already known to play a role in the control of cell remodeling in adipogenesis <cit> . despite this fact, little is known about the cellular mechanisms leading to stimulation of differentiation. understanding these effects will be essential in order to understand the mechanism, how a mesenchymal cell decides to divide or to differentiate, which in turn will allow developing effective strategies to control fat pad growth and fight the obesity pandemic. in a previous study we used 3t3-l <dig> cells mainly for the analysis of translational efficiency during the first six hours of adipogenesis <cit> . here we expand this analysis and focus on changes in total mrna steady state levels as well as changes of the abundance of polysomal mrnas, based on the data collected in the original experiment. RESULTS grouping genes by their translation and transcription efficiencies was based on the approach applied in <cit> . as described in the methods section, we revealed differential gene expression by significant differences between time-related, namely 0 h and 6 h after hormonal stimulation, fold changes of polysomal and non-polysomal rna fractions. we refer to the ratio of these time-related fold changes as “translation efficiency” , with positive values indicating an up-regulated translation. “transcription efficiency” is defined as the ratio of the total, i.e. polysomal and non-polysomal, fractions six hours after and before adipogenesis induction, with positive values indicating an up-regulated transcription. differential expression was detected in an analogous manner as for translation efficiency, applying a moderated gene-by-gene t-test followed by p-value adjustment for multiple testing. we regarded differential expression as significant in case of an fdr smaller than <dig> and an absolute log <dig> fold-change greater than one. accordingly, we found nine groups of genes , namely with significantly up-regulated transcription and translation , significantly up-regulated transcription and no significant translation , significantly up-regulated transcription and down-regulated translation , no significant transcription and significantly up-regulated translation , no significant transcription or translation , no significant transcription and significantly down-regulated translation , significantly down-regulated transcription and up-regulated translation , significantly down-regulated transcription and no significant translation , and significantly down-regulated transcription and translation . as shown in figure <dig> the groups containing most of the genes are tc:up/tl:up and tc:up/tl:unchanged . fewer genes were found in the group tc:unchanged/tl:up . <dig> genes were found to be unchanged both at the transcriptional as well as the translational level. a general shift towards increased transcriptional and translational activity has been detected . we detected <dig> genes being significantly down-regulated at the transcriptional level , and <dig> genes being up-regulated at the transcriptional level . <dig> genes were up-regulated at the translational level , and <dig> genes were down-regulated at the translational level .table <dig> classification of transcripts according to their regulation at the transcriptional or translational level changes in transcriptional and translational activity. the smooth scatter plot shows the genes of groups 1– <dig> in table <dig> with some selected outliers being highlighted. a total of <dig> genes were found to be controlled only at the transcriptional level , while <dig> genes were controlled only at the translational level . we analyzed these groups for clusters of molecular function or biological processes , using the topgo software for gene ontology analysis <cit> . top motif analysis the 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine tract motif is typical for mrnas encoding proteins associated with the translational apparatus. this motif embeds the core of the translational cis-regulatory element of these so-called top mrnas. the top motif is found in mrnas coding for many components of the translational machinery. the related top mrna protein synthesis is regulated in a cell growth dependent manner. to avoid energy wastage upon growth arrest or shortage of amino acids, cells repress ribosome biogenesis via translational control of top mrnas by trans-acting factor recognizing the 5′top motif . hamilton et al. <cit> assume that growth factors affect top mrna translation via pi3k/mtor pathways. above that they speculate that top-like regulation is not restricted to mrnas that are involved in ribosome biogenesis. thoreen et al. <cit> confirm that mrnas, which are specifically regulated by mtorc <dig> consist almost entirely of transcripts with 5′top motifs. furthermore they support the hypothesis that top and top-like motifs are more numerous than previously assumed. due to their important regulatory function in translation, top mrnas may be expected to be up-regulated at least at the translational level at the first stage of adipogenesis here. fisher’s exact test results showed that only in the tc:up/tl:up group top motifs appeared significantly more often than in the other groups. the utrscan <cit> result for the related <dig> genes of this group is displayed in table <dig> with two genes containing two consecutive top motifs each, namely rpl <dig> and polr2h. to the best of our knowledge, these data demonstrate up-regulation of top mrnas in adipogenesis for the first time.table <dig> genes bearing a top motif within the tc:up/tl:up group increased mrnas steady state levels tc:up/tl:up among the <dig> inferred bp classes, the highest significant go classes comprise ‘translation’, ‘ribosome biogenesis’, ‘rrna processing’, ‘gene expression’, ‘macromolecule biosynthetic process’, ‘non-coding rna processing’, and ‘negative regulation of transcription from rna polymerase ii promoter’ . the most significant groups are involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes or initiation of translation . the majority of genes are involved in biosynthetic processes and regulation of cellular metabolic processes. other groups comprise cell differentiation, cellular component biogenesis, regulation of intracellular protein kinase cascade and anatomical structure development.figure <dig> go term visualization for gene groups of interest. the scatterplot shows the terms after redundancy reduction via revigo, representing functional clusters. the bubble color indicates the p-values of the topgo analysis, and the bubble size indicates the frequency of the go term in the underlying goa database, i.e. the more general the term, the larger the bubbles. the go terms cluster together in the semantic space according to functional similarity, without intrinsic meaning of semantic space units. a: tc:up/tl:up , b: tc:up/tl:down , c: tc:unchanged/tl:down , d: tc:down/tl:unchanged . several rps were found in about 30% of all bp classes, and il <dig> was found in about 10% of all bp classes. cebpb was detected in about 20% of all bp classes. finally, vegfa, wnt5a, sox <dig> and cav <dig> are represented in more than one third of the <dig> bp classes. recently, elias et al. noted that vascular endothelial growth factor a , a classical key factor in angiogenesis and tissue remodeling, seems to play a role in the control of energy metabolism and adipose tissue function, too <cit> . the wnt pathway has also already been shown to be involved in regulation of adipocyte function <cit> . sox <dig> and caveolin- <dig> are known as well to have important functions in adipocytes or their differentiation <cit> . the role of cebpb in adipogenesis has been discussed in our previous study <cit> . interleukin <dig> signaling has also been regarded as regulatory functional in 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes <cit> . genes encoding rps were expected to be found in the tc:up/tl:up group, as translation implies an increased abundance of ribosomes. it is speculated that all rp mrnas belong to the class of top mrnas <cit> . with respect to mf, <dig> go classes were inferred, of which ‘structural constituent of ribosome’ and ‘structural molecule activity’ were found to be most significant, and the majority of genes is involved in these groups . it should be mentioned that all mrna species in the first group were also found in the second group . in the latter group, additionally gamma-actin, caveolin- <dig> cytokeratins, mitogen-activated protein kinase <dig> interacting protein <dig> and beta-tubulins are present. the other mf classes in the tc:up/tl:up group, as ‘endonuclease activity’, ‘polysaccharide binding’, or ‘nuclease activity’, show p-values between <dig> and <dig> . the ‘nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity’ go class contains <dig> different mrna species. five genes are represented by two transcripts, amongst those junb, cebpb and myc. tsc22d3/gilz is represented by three transcripts. tsc22d3/gilz is a glucocorticoid responsive leucine zipper transcription factor, which inhibits adipogenesis in stably transfected cell lines. it binds to c/ebp binding sites in the pparγ <dig> promoter and inhibits its transcription. during adipogenesis of 3t3-l <dig> cells, gilz protein is detectable three hours after stimulation of adipogenesis and decreases after 24 hours, presumably allowing pparγ <dig> expression at later time points <cit> . within the tc:up/tl:up group, almost all factors of the late cornified envelope family <dig> , that are present in the nine analyzed groups , were found, hence changing expression in early adipogenesis. exceptionally, lce1m is up-regulated at the translational level but unchanged at the transcriptional level. jackson et al. found out that lce <dig> genes were predominantly expressed in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin <cit> . they described an up-regulation of lce <dig> genes in normal human keratinocytes by ultraviolet irradiation. otherwise the lce <dig> protein family is significantly down-regulated in aging <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, a correlation between the lce family and adipogenesis has not been described up to now. tc:up/tl:unchanged <dig> bp classes were identified . the ‘protein modification by small protein conjugation or removal’ group, which contains all mrnas of the ‘protein polyubiquitination’ and ‘protein ubiquitination’ groups, shows the most significant p-value. the majority of the genes are involved in transport, localization and macromolecule modification processes, which play an important role in re-organization of the cell. other go terms contributing to this were found, namely ‘actin cytoskeleton reorganization’, ‘golgi vesicle transport’, ‘post-golgi vesicle-mediated transport’, ‘golgi to plasma membrane transport’, ‘organelle fusion’, ‘positive regulation of cell differentiation’, ‘regulation of cell-cell adhesion’ and ‘cell-cell adhesion mediated by integrin’. furthermore, bp classes comprise go terms of anabolic and catabolic processes, such as ‘oxidative phosphorylation’, ‘mitochondrial electron transport, nadh to ubiquinone’ or ‘energy reserve metabolic process’. polyamines, which are also represented, were shown to be involved in adipogenesis before <cit> . the <dig> mf classes are mainly related to metal binding , such as ‘transition metal ion binding’, ‘ion binding’, ‘cation binding’, with a special emphasis on zinc binding . furthermore, ‘ubiquitin-ubiquitin ligase activity’ and ‘thrombospondin receptor activity’ are represented in this group.figure <dig> go term visualization for gene groups of interest. the scatterplot shows the terms after redundancy reduction via revigo, representing functional clusters. the bubble color indicates the p-values of the topgo analysis, and the bubble size indicates the frequency of the go term in the underlying goa database, i.e. the more general the term, the larger the bubbles. the go terms cluster together in the semantic space according to functional similarity, without intrinsic meaning of semantic space units. a: tc:up/tl:unchanged , b: tc:unchanged/tl:up , c: tc:down/tl:up , d: tc:down/tl:down . zinc has been associated with adipogenesis before. zinc levels were shown to influence the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of primary bone marrow stromal cells in mouse and to inhibit adipogenesis <cit> . zinc also exerts insulin-mimetic and anti-diabetic effects. in rodent models of diabetes, zinc treatment improves carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. in cell culture, it enhances glucose transport, glycogen and lipid synthesis, and inhibits gluconeogenesis and lipolysis <cit> . an interesting factor depending on zinc is zinc α2-glycoprotein . its mrna steady state levels in fat tissue depend on the degree of insulin resistance in morbidly obese patients <cit> . in serum, zag correlated positively with hdl cholesterol and adiponectin and inversely with the degree of ir <cit> . zinc finger proteins are important regulators of transcription, and an increasing number is found to be involved in the regulation of normal cell growth and development <cit> . for example, zfp <dig> <cit> , zfp <dig> <cit> , znf <dig> <cit> , znf <dig> <cit> , snail <cit> and kruppel-like transcription factors <cit> were shown to be regulative in adipogenesis. in this group here, we detected eleven different zfps as well as klf <dig> klf <dig> and klf <dig> in line with the idea that translational control plays an important role in adipogenesis, haematopoietic zinc finger regulates the central adipogenic factor c/ebpα <cit> at the translational level. zinc seems to play an important role in both, adipogenesis and function of mature fat tissue. up-regulation of zinc- and other metal-transporters was detected in our study at the transcriptional level but not at the translational level, which might indicate that their increased levels are required at later stages of adipogenesis in a regulatory manner. tc:up/tl:down we identified <dig> bp classes with five genes and <dig> mf classes with four genes being involved. amongst those, thbs <dig> adarb1/adar <dig> and masp <dig> participate in both go categories. thrombospondin- <dig> seems to play an important role, as it is involved in 89% of all bp groups and in 61% of all mf groups with a two-fold transcriptional up-regulation. in growth hormone induced adipogenesis of 3 t3-f442a pre-adipocytes, thbs <dig> expression increased within 60 minutes, and for this it is expected to be important in initiation of adipogenic differentiation <cit> . additionally, up-regulation of thrombospondin- <dig> protein levels has already been shown to be associated with obesity but can be corrected by physical exercise <cit> . in their recent work kong et al. described its regulatory role in adiposity and metabolic dysfunction by enhancing adipose inflammation and stimulating adipocyte proliferation <cit> . while adarb1/adar <dig> is up-regulated at the transcriptional and down-regulated at the translational level, another member of the double stranded rna adenosine deaminases, adarb2/adar <dig> is unchanged at the transcriptional but up-regulated at the translational level. a polymorphism in adarb2/adar <dig> has recently been found to be positively associated with abdominal circumference, body mass index, serum triglyceride level, and negatively associated with serum adiponectin level <cit> . unchanged mrnas steady state levels tc:unchanged/tl:up within the <dig> identified bp classes, we found several redundant but highly significant go groups, containing different factors of the olfactory receptor family . many genes are involved in ‘g-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway’ and ‘oxidation-reduction process’. furthermore, we detected groups of ‘vacuole organization’ and ‘vacuolar transport’, ‘glucose homeostasis’, ‘fructose metabolic process’ and ‘macroautophagy’. within the <dig> mf classes, ‘olfactory receptor activity’ shows highest significance by far . other go classes contain factors of ‘peptidase activity’, ‘g-protein coupled receptor activity’, ‘oxidoreductase activity’, in which most of the genes are involved, ‘acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferase activity’, ‘glutamate receptor activity’ or ‘ion transmembrane transporter activity’. hence, there is evidence for involvement of the olfactory system in adipogenesis. indeed, Åkerblad et al. <cit> state that the olfactory system participates in the regulation of food intake impacting overall metabolism. they specifically analyzed the transcription factor olf-1/early b-cell factor , which is important for controlling b-lymphocyte-specific genes and transcriptional regulation of genes in olfactory receptor neurons. according to their findings, all three known o/e genes, which regulate genes in the olfactory system, are expressed in mouse adipose tissue and up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation. they observed that forced expression of o/e- <dig> in the pre-adipocyte cell line 3t3-l <dig> enhances adipogenesis, whereas a dominant negative form of it leads to partial suppression . interestingly, o/e- <dig> is up-regulated within less than two hours after stimulation of adipogenesis at the transcriptional level, and mrna levels drop to normal levels approximately three hours after stimulation, followed by a slight increase of expression until 12 hours after the hormonal pulse <cit> . towards the end of adipogenesis, ebf <dig> mrna levels increase. here, two ebf <dig> probes were spotted on the microarray. the fdr of ak <dig> just slightly exceeded the cutoff of <dig> . with a translation efficiency of <dig> and a corresponding fdr of <dig> , it was almost part of the tc:unchanged/tl:up group. the second probe is part of the tc:down/tl:unchanged group. this finding might indicate that different functional populations of ebf <dig> transcripts exist which are differently regulated on the transcriptional and translational level in a time-sensitive manner. the immediate decrease of ebf <dig> expression after the peak at around 1 hour after hormonal stimulation explains why transcription efficiency in our analysis is not significant, as we analyzed changes between <dig> and 0 hours. in the transcriptional cascade of adipogenesis, jimenez et al. placed ebf action between c/ebpβ/δ and c/ebpα/pparγ, although they do not rule out further downstream effects of ebf proteins, that might also be critical for differentiation <cit> . growth arrest at confluence is the first stage of 3t3-l <dig> adipocyte differentiation, and at this time also the formation of the primary cilium is induced. zhu et al. state that the igf- <dig> receptor, an essential element in inducing differentiation, is sensitized by the formation of a primary cilium in confluent 3t3-l <dig> pre-adipocytes <cit> . interestingly, the primary cilium is also required for g-protein-coupled olfactory receptor signaling <cit> , which explains the over-representation of the olfactory system in this mrna group. if olfactory mrnas show up-regulated translation, the primary cilium seems to be functional, and hence pinpointing to igf- <dig> receptor induced differentiation of the pre-adipocytes. in this regard, it is also noteworthy that egfr, which drives cell growth <cit> , was predominantly detected in the tc:down/tl:down group, thus supporting the state of growth arrest and initialization of differentiation. the fact that g-protein coupled receptors mediate the detection and discrimination of diverse organic and inorganic compounds by the brain's olfactory epithelium <cit> , supports our finding of translationally up-regulated gpcrs here. tc:unchanged/tl:down six out of the ten genes are categorized into <dig> bp classes , the most frequent being mll <dig> a histone methyltransferase implicated in adipogenesis <cit> , rev3l, a component of zeta polymerase, which is important for translesion dna synthesis <cit> and 2210018m11rik, according to go analysis mainly involved in dna repair, chromatin modification and metabolic processes. the groups ‘cellular macromolecule metabolic process’ and ‘macromolecule metabolic process’ contain all of the six genes; the group ‘nucleic acid metabolic process’ lacks only ubr <dig> a graphical representation of the bp terms is shown in figure 2c. five genes are distributed into <dig> mf classes, with four of them being present in the group ‘nucleic acid binding’ . the most significant classes include just mll <dig> and are related to methyltransferase activity. decreased mrnas steady state levels tc:down/tl:up not many genes are involved in the <dig> bp classes, but almost 10% of the <dig> tc:down/tl:up genes are involved in signal transduction processes, namely ‘small gtpase mediated signal transduction’, ‘regulation of protein phosphorylation’ and ‘regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity’ . among those genes we found inppl <dig> an outlier marked in figure <dig> encoding ship <dig> which was shown to contribute to dietary obesity <cit> . to get an estimate for the combined influence of changes in gene expression and protein synthesis, we calculated the sum of transcription and translation efficiency, i.e. total. we analyzed single genes in the tc:down/tl:up group with regard to the combined influence of tc and tl. as expected, total was found to be positive for some factors, like polr2a , pik3c2g , fshb or zscan <dig> , and negative for others, as lbh , ppp1r3d , ensmusg <dig> or slc40a <dig> . vangl <dig> is the most abundant gene in the bp classes. it is present in <dig> groups and is annotated to many pathways. in the context of adipogenesis, ‘non-canonical wnt receptor signaling pathway’, ‘regulation of map kinase activity’ and ‘regulation of jun kinase activity’ are of special interest <cit> . however, vangl <dig> shows slight net down-regulation, i.e. total < <dig> other important classes are ‘cholesterol biosynthetic process’ and ‘sterol biosynthetic process’, which include the genes mvd, fdps and nsdhl. a similar situation, i.e. few genes involved in the go classes, was observed in the <dig> mf classes . here the most significant classes include ‘porin activity’ as well as important functions for glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, involving the genes pfkm and pck <dig> . above that we detected ‘eicosanoid receptor activity’, and ppar-γ is such a receptor <cit> with important function in adipogenesis <cit> . regarding the observed signaling functions in bp, we here detected ‘phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity’ and ‘phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase activity’. a graphical representation of the mf terms is shown in figure 3c. tc:down/tl:unchanged of the <dig> bp classes, ‘chromosome organization’, ‘positive regulation of metabolic process’ and ‘positive regulation of macromolecule biosynthetic process’, ‘dna metabolic process’, ‘organelle organization’, ‘positive regulation of transcription, dna-dependent’, ‘microtubule cytoskeleton organization’ and ‘chromatin modification’ are among the most significant terms . the majority of genes are involved in regulation, metabolism, biosynthesis and response to stimuli. a graphical representation of the bp terms is shown in figure 2d. <dig> mf classes were detected, comprising processes of lipid and nucleic acid binding, ‘rna polymerase ii transcription cofactor activity’, ‘transcription cofactor activity’, ‘chromatin binding’ or ‘rna polymerase ii regulatory region dna binding’ . we speculate that the regulatory functions are repressed at the initialization of adipogenesis and up-regulated at later time points, which would explain the down-regulated transcription and unchanged translation of this cluster. tc:down/tl:down within the <dig> bp classes, a small number of mrnas is encountered in many groups, such as egfr , ghrl or brca <dig> . the mrnas in this category are over-represented in ‘gland development’, ‘centrosome organization’, ‘microtubule organizing center organization’, ‘activation of mapkk activity’, ‘response to interferon-alpha’, ‘dna repair’ and ‘dna replication’, ‘regulation of metabolic process’, ‘regulation of locomotion’, ‘cell cycle process’ and ‘regulation of rap gtpase activity’. the only gene represented in ‘regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity involved in g1/s’ and ‘negative regulation of mitotic cell cycle’ is egfr. in the group ‘g1/s transition of mitotic cell cycle’ also pole is involved. ghrl is, among other classes, involved in ‘regulation of appetite’, ‘sleep’, ‘response to food’ and ‘negative regulation of insulin secretion’. the <dig> mf classes comprise ‘epidermal growth factor binding’, ‘ribonucleotide binding’, ‘actin binding’, ‘protein kinase activity’ and ‘histone acetyltransferase activity’ . the term ‘epidermal growth factor-activated receptor activity’ is most significant, stressing an important role of egfr here. many publications have already focused on egfr, a known oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase inducing signaling cascades, in the context of adipogenesis, hence linking cancer and obesity. the activating growth factor of this receptor is the epidermal growth factor . adachi et al. observed that egf inhibits pre-adipocyte differentiation into mature adipocytes, but promotes adipogenesis in differentiated adipocytes in dose- and time-dependent manners in 3t3-l <dig> cells <cit> . the dose dependence, i.e. high egf concentrations inhibit, whereas low concentrations support pre-adipocyte differentiation, was also mentioned by harrington et al. <cit> . according to nakano et al. <cit> , egfr promotes proliferation but inhibits differentiation of adipocytes. rogers et al. showed egfr correlation with insulin sensitivity and pparγ <cit> , stimulating adipogenesis in human pre-adipocytes. harmon et al. showed that egfr phosphorylates c/ebpβ in 3t3-l <dig> cells during the first 72 h of differentiation, also stimulating adipogenesis <cit> . also igf1/egfr crosstalk or transactivation was observed <cit> , mediating the insulin-leptin-adiponectin axis in breast cancer tumorigenesis <cit> . leptin also activates egfr <cit> . above that obesity-linked ship <dig> which we detected in the “signaling group”, correlates with egfr <cit> and protects it from degradation <cit> . with respect to diabetes, miettinen et al. observed that down-regulated egfr in pancreatic islets is linked to impaired postnatal beta-cell growth, which contributes to diabetes development <cit> . above that decreased egfr binding was observed in diabetic rats <cit> , and decreased autophosphorylation of egfr was reported in insulin-deficient diabetic rats <cit> . also glucocorticoids modulate insulin and egfr activity in rats, depending on the animals’ dietary state <cit> . the role of ghrl, which it marked as an outlier in figure <dig> in adipogenesis has already been discussed in our previous study <cit> . interestingly, ifit <dig> is an outlier in the tc:down/tl:down group, too , and we discussed the role of ifit <dig> in our previous study <cit> . CONCLUSIONS we re-analyzed experimental data to measure changes in the transcriptional and translational activity at the beginning of adipogenesis in 3t3-l <dig> cells. in our previous study <cit> we analyzed changes of mrna abundance in the free mrna and polysomal fraction after sucrose gradient centrifugation of mrnas at time point <dig> and 6 hours after hormonal induction of adipogenesis. here, we extended the analysis of temporal changes in the abundance of polysomal mrnas by changes in overall mrna, i.e. transcripts, abundance and the analysis of the relation of these transcriptional and translational changes. the fact that we detected distinct functional gene clusters with specific activity status of transcription and translation at the initialization of adipogenesis points to a temporally well-orchestrated interplay between relevant genes in adipocyte transformation . interestingly, main findings regarding functionalities in adipogenesis have already been published elsewhere, but here we link these biological processes and molecular functions specifically to modes of transcriptional and translational activity.figure <dig> scheme of affected cellular processes. the scheme of the adipocyte visualizes prominent cellular processes that are over-represented in the eight analyzed groups. the structures and name of the corresponding group have same colors. the tc:up/tl:up group is represented by ribosomes. the tc:up/tl:unchanged group is symbolized by zinc . the tc:up/tl:down group is represented by thrombospondin binding to a receptor. analogously, we chose receptor symbols for the tc:unchanged/tl:up group and the tc:down/tl:down group. the yellow arrow symbolizes signaling of the tc:down/tl:up group, e.g. via phosphorylation cascades as initialized by receptor dimerization. the tc:unchanged/tl:down group is denoted by methyl groups attached to the dna in the nucleus. the tc:down/tl:unchanged group is represented by a traffic light. in some groups single genes are outstanding, like egfr, linking obesity and cancer, or thbs <dig> encoding the multifunctional protein thrombospondin <dig> the majority of significant genes in the “translation group” with both, transcription and translation efficiency being up-regulated, hints at the importance of polysome organization, functionality and activity in adipocyte differentiation. in this regard, it was logically consequent to detect top motifs in this cluster, due to their importance in the translation regulation process. in the context of obesity research, we intended to gain deeper insight into the transcriptional and translational interaction of genes in early adipogenesis. based on our findings, more efficient strategies to counteract dysregulated adipocyte growth could be developed, targeting genes not only on the basis of differential expression but also on their role in specific functional clusters.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the pathophysiology and key clinical markers. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND the genus leptospira is composed of both saprophytic and pathogenic species <cit> . pathogenic leptospira spp., such as l. interrogans, l. borgpetersenii, l. weilii and l. kirschner, are the causative agents of leptospirosis, a serious world-wide disease in humans and animals <cit> . the disease in humans occurs mostly after contact, often through skin wounds, with soil or water contaminated by urine of infected animals. its severity varies from mild to rapidly fatal. severe symptoms are characterized by visible jaundice involving hepatic injury, acute renal failure, carditis and hemorrhage, and case fatality varies from a few percent to 25% <cit> . however, the mechanisms of disease caused by pathogenic leptospira spp. remain largely unknown. both pathogenic and saprophytic leptospires express two endoflagella . one of the endoflagella is attached at one end of the cell and is located between the protoplasmic cylinder and the outer membrane sheath <cit> . the endoflagella, rotating within the periplasmic space, are responsible for spirochete motility. in pathogenic leptospira species, this motility is considered to contribute to invasion into hosts and diffusion within the hosts during infection <cit> . in previous studies, we found that pathogenic leptospires can adhere to host cells with one or two termini of the microbial bodies, while non-pathogenic leptospiral strains lacked this ability <cit> . the adhering positions were located at the terminal knobs in which flagellar basal bodies are found <cit> . at the bottom of the flagellar structure, there is a basal body composed of ms and c rings <cit> . in flagellated bacteria, some proteins in the fli family form the c ring, which functions as the flagellar rotor and contains the directional switching capability of the flagellar motor <cit> . however, a possible role for the leptospiral endoflagella in pathogenicity has never been explored. a complete set of flagella-associated genes were found in the genomic sequences of l. interrogans serovar lai strain lai and serovar copenhageni strain fiocruz l1- <dig> including four genes that encode flagellar motor switch proteins <cit> . in bacteria, the flagellar motor switch proteins play a critical role in control of flagellar motor direction <cit> . thus far fliy has been found in some spirochetes and a few bacteria but does not exist in most bacteria <cit> . particularly, fliy of bacillus subtilis was shown to be a chey-p-hydrolyzing protein in the chemotactic signaling cascade <cit> . in addition, leptospiral fliy carries a carboxy-terminal domain of <dig> amino acid residues that is homologous to a domain of yscq in yersinia pestis <cit> . the yscq protein was identified as a member of the flagellar associated type iii secretion system , with multiple functions such as controlling the directional rotation of flagella and the export of virulence factors including yop proteins <cit> . the c ring of escherichia coli does not have fliy, but its flin has a high sequence homology with fliy of l. interrogans strain lai <cit> and flin is an essential agent for motility and virulence protein export <cit> . these data suggest that fliy of pathogenic leptospira species may have important functions in motility and virulence. in the present study, we constructed a fliy gene knock-out mutant of l. interrogans serovar lai strain lai based on homologous recombination using a suicide plasmid. to examine the possible role of fliy in pathogenesis, the mutant and wild-type strain were compared in assays of motility in liquid medium and migration on semisolid agar, adhesion to macrophages, stimulation of apoptosis in infected host cells, and lethality to guinea pigs. RESULTS products of fliy gene amplification and rfliy expression the amplification segments with expected size of the entire fliy gene from l. interrogans serovar lai strain lai were obtained by pcr . the cloned fliy gene had 100% nucleotide sequence identity with the reported sequences in genbank <cit> . the recombinant plasmid, e. coli bl21de3pet32a-fliy, expressed rfliy under inducement of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside , and the purified rfliy by ni-nta affinity chromatography showed a single band on a polyacrylamide gel after electrophoresis . the rabbits immunized with rfliy could produce rfliy-specific serum antibody and the immunodiffusion titer of antiserum against rfliy was 1: <dig> characterization of the fliy- mutant to create a fliy- mutant of l. interrogans, we cloned the fliy gene into p2nil and inserted an ampicillin gene at the bgl ii site near the 5' end. this plasmid was then introduced into l. interrogans followed by selection for ampicillin resistance, to create a fliy bla mutant. sequencing data indicated that the fliy gene and ampicillin resistance gene segments in suicide plasmid p2nilfliy-bla had the same orientation, and the nucleotide sequences were the same as in the original cloned fliy and bla genes. the fliy- mutant could grow in <dig> μg/ml ampicillin-contained korthof liquid medium for at least <dig> months in our laboratory. the generation time of the mutant was the same as that of the wild-type strain. subsequent pcr analysis confirmed that the mutant maintained a modified fliy gene that was larger than the wild-type gene , into which inserted the ampicillin resistance gene had been inserted . the western blot analysis also revealed the absence of expression of fliy in the mutant . furthermore, the absence of mrnas for the flip and fliq genes, downstream of fliy gene, indicated that the transcription of the two genes were inhibited . in fact, ten genes should be transcribed by the same operon, based on the genome structure predicted by the software, microbesonline operon predictions . persistently lower motility of the fliy- mutant normally, leptospires have a typical motive manner with rotation. however, all microbes of the fliy- mutant in liquid korthof medium by dark-field microscopy only had 40% of rotative motion frequency per minute of the wild-type strain, but presented a similar shape to the wild-type strain . on semisolid korthof agar plates, the colonies of the fliy- mutant were noticeably smaller than that of the wild-type strain , consistent with attenuated motility of the mutant. altered adhesion of the fliy- mutant the wild-type l. interrogans strain lai could adhere to the surface of j774a. <dig> cells with one or both bacterial ends . the attached wild-type leptospires were visible on the cell surface after <dig> min post inoculation and the adhesion ratios approached a plateau after <dig> to <dig> min p.i. . however, the fliy- mutant was significantly impaired in its ability to adhere to the macrophages, compared to the wild-type strain . host-cell apoptosis induced by the wild-type and the fliy- mutant strains as shown in fig <dig> the wild-type l. interrogans strain lai induced apoptosis of j774a. <dig> cells, and the maximal apoptotic ratio appeared after <dig> h coincubation, as detected by flow cytometry . however, the ability of the fliy- mutant to cause apoptosis was markedly decreased, and the levels of apoptosis and late apoptosis/necrosis at all the different incubation times were significantly lower than those induced by the wild-type strain . attenuated lethality of the fliy- mutant strain in guinea pigs the lethality to guinea pigs of the wild-type l. interrogans strain lai was significantly larger than of the fliy- mutant during a 10d post-challenge period . no animals infected by the fliy- mutant strain died comparing with 100% death, which were infected by wild-type strain with the same dosage. when the challenge dosage for the fliy- mutant was increased to ten times the dosage used for the wild-type strain, only 60% of the animals infected with the fliy- mutant died. discussion recent reports have shown that flagellin and other flagella-associated proteins from many bacteria participate in adhesion to host cells and colonization of hosts <cit> . in vitro studies have suggested that the role of flagella could be to increase invasion into host cells and survival within macrophages <cit> . however, the correlation between flagella and pathogenicity of pathogenic leptospira spp. had not been investigated until now. l. interrogans serogroup icterohaemorrhagiae serovar lai strain lai is the most prevalent pathogenic leptospiral strain, which is responsible for over 70% of human leptospirosis cases in china <cit> . we therefore inactivated the fliy gene in l. interrogans strain lai using a suicide plasmid, which is a frequently adopted strategy for determining the function of a target gene. recently, croda and his colleagues used plasmid pb2sk to successfully construct a suicide plasmid with spectinomycin resistance for inactivating the ligb gene of l. interrogans serovar copenhageni strain fiocruz l1- <dig> <cit> . in the present study we first used another plasmid, p2nil, with an ampicillin resistance gene to construct a fliy gene knock out mutant. a fliy- mutant has been constructed, but that fliy inactivation by ampicillin cassette insertion also negatively affected downstream genes; therefore, care has to be taken when interpreting the phenotypes observed for this mutant. the inactivation of the fliy gene has shown different effects on formation of flagella in different bacteria. in bacillus subtilis, the deletion of fliy resulted in the loss of flagella <cit> . however, the flagella were still produced in the fliy-deleted strain of bacillus cereus <cit> . although the leptospiral fliy- mutant generated in this study displayed remarkably attenuated motility compared to the wild-type strain, it maintained the typical spiral shape and propeller movement which is caused by the periplasmic endoflagella <cit> . as mentioned previously, the major function of flagellar motor switch proteins is to control flagellar motor direction <cit> . thus, we infer that the fliy gene inactivation should not affect the formation of the endoflagella. it is well known that adhesion to host cells is a primary and critical step for bacterial infection <cit> . recently, the importance of cell adhesion for pathogenic leptospira spp. has been demonstrated <cit> . adhesion to host cells also acts as an essential role for pathogenicity of other spirochetes <cit> . mononuclear macrophages are the most important phagocytes in the human innate and acquired immnune systems. however, many pathogenic bacteria can evade host immunity by inducing apoptosis of macrophages <cit> . similarly, pathogenic leptospira spp. can escape from the host immune system by promoting macrophage apoptosis <cit> . in the present study, we provide evidence that the ability of the fliy- mutant to adhere to j774a. <dig> cells, to induce apoptosis in the cells, and to cause death in guinea pigs is much lower than for the wild-type strain. all the phentotypes observed, including lower pathogenicity, could be a consequence of fliy inactivation, or a consequence of the polar effects, or of both. t3ss is one of protein export systems used by most gram-negative bacteria <cit> . morphologically, as a transmembrane channel, t3ss is composed of multiple protein complexes called an injectisome, responsible for transporting virulence factors into host cells, some of which cause cell metabolic disorder and death <cit> . however, the flagellar export apparatus can also function as a bacterial virulence protein secretion system <cit> . for example, flif of pseudomonas aeruginosa, a flagellar associated protein component in the ms ring, is involved in adhesion by controlling secretion of bacterial adhesins <cit> . although the t3ss and flagellar export apparatus are two relatively separate systems in many pathogenic bacteria <cit> , the t3ss and flagellar export apparatus in yersinia enterocolitica play a common role in secretion of bacterial phospholipases during infection <cit> . taken together, these observations suggest that inactivation of the leptospiral fliy gene may decrease the export of some unknown adhesion- and cytotoxicity-associated virulence proteins. CONCLUSIONS inactivation of fliy clearly had polar effects on downstream genes. the phentotypes observed, including decreasing motility, adhesion to macrophages and host-cell apoptosis, and attenuating lethality in infected guinea pigs, could be a consequence of fliy inactivation, but also a consequence of the polar effects.",

    "prompt": "Capture the essential diagnostic criteria in a short summary. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND when the human genome was sequenced, it was found to contain approximately <dig> <dig> genes <cit> . considering the complex biological system encoded by these genes, this seems to be a small number. however, alternative transcripts that arise from different transcription start sites or alternative splicing, may yield a much larger array of functionally related proteins than suggested from the number of actual genes. large scale genomic studies have revealed that 65% of all genes have alternative transcripts <cit> . elucidation of the role and regulation of transcript variants may shed light on how a rather modest number of genes can give rise to the complexity of human biology <cit> . related proteins encoded by the same gene through alternative transcription may have opposing functions in the cell. for instance, transcription factors may exist as isoforms lacking particular dna- or protein interacting domains. when such isoforms are expressed, they may inhibit the function of the full length protein <cit> . an in silico analysis of the mouse transcriptome revealed that alternative splicing preferentially adds or deletes domains in transcription factors that are important for dna binding <cit> . the function of a protein encoded by a particular gene may thus be regulated at the level of differential expression of various transcript variants dependent on the tissue or cell type, or the differentiation status and previous history of the cell <cit> . one prominent example of this type of gene regulation in t cells, is the cd <dig> protein, a membrane receptor tyrosine phosphatase that exists as several isoforms generated by alternative splicing of exons <cit> . the quality of the t cell response in naïve versus experienced t cells is determined in part by the composition of expressed cd <dig> isoforms on the cell surface <cit> . previously, we reported the cloning of the immunoregulatory gene sh2d2a that encodes the t cell specific adapter protein <cit> . adapter proteins lack catalytic activity, but may be crucial in regulation of cellular signalling by mediating protein-protein interactions through conserved protein binding domains <cit> . the function of tsad is as yet unclear, but the murine homologue lad/ribp has been identified as a binding partner for lck, itk/rlk, mekk <dig> and grb <dig> <cit> and human tsad has been found to associate with lck <cit> as well as the molecular chaperone vcp <cit> and vascular endothelial growth receptor <dig> <cit> . recently it has been shown that tsad vegfr- <dig> interaction promotes actin polymerization and migration <cit> . tsad may be involved in the regulation of membrane proximal t cell signalling by modulating the lck activity <cit> , and it has been proposed that tsad may be directly involved in regulation of gene transcription as a transcription adapter protein <cit> . mice lacking expression of tsad are apparently normal <cit> , but as they grow older they spontaneously develop a systemic autoimmune disease <cit> . five naturally occurring transcript variants of human tsad exist. the sh2d2a- <dig> variant encodes full length tsad <cit> , whereas the sh2d2a- <dig> and - <dig> variants encodes tsad proteins shortened by <dig> aa and <dig> aa in the n-terminus, respectively. the sh2d2a- <dig> variant encodes a <dig> aa insertion in the sh <dig> domain of tsad, whereas the sh2d2a- <dig> variant lacks the entire exon <dig> <cit> , which encodes most of the proline rich region including the four c-terminal tyrosines of tsad. the sh2d2a-1- <dig> variants have been isolated from t cells, whereas the sh2d2a- <dig> variant was first identified in a pineal gland cdna library <cit> . in this study, we analysed tsad molecules encoded by the sh2d2a transcript variants to identify potentially important functional domains. we identified tsad aa239– <dig> encoded by exon <dig> to be crucial for tyrosine phosphorylation of tsad by lck, for interaction with the lck-sh <dig> and lck-sh <dig> domain, and for modulation of lck activity. in addition, tsad aa239– <dig> controls tsad translocation to the nucleus. in conclusion, this study demonstrates that exon <dig> encodes structures of importance for tsad function, and that truncated tsad is co-expressed with the full length tsad in cd4+ t cells. whether alternative transcripts of tsad contribute to regulation of tsad function, by being differentially regulated under given circumstances or in given tissues remains to be elucidated. RESULTS expression of tsad variants in primary cd4+ t cells five transcript variants of tsad that encode tsad polypeptides with variable lengths have been reported . we previously observed that tsad mrnas sh2d2a-1- <dig> were expressed in pha stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells <cit> . in this study, we used reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr assay to assess the relative amounts of tsad transcript variants expressed in primary cd4+ t cells . the sh2d2a- <dig> and - <dig> variants constituted 10–15% each, whereas the sh2d2a- <dig> variant which was originally cloned from a pineal gland library, constituted around 5–10% of the total amount of tsad-transcripts in anti-cd <dig> stimulated cd4+ t cells from healthy blood donors. the sh2d2a- <dig> variant, although present, often fell below the detection limit of the assay. it is possible that the function of tsad may be regulated by changing the relative amount of the different tsad transcript variants. we therefore analysed the expression of tsad transcript variants at different time points after anti-cd <dig> stimulation of cd4+ t cells. as seen from figure 2b, the relative distribution of the tsad transcript variants was relatively constant during the observation period. immunoblot of primary cd4+ t cells stimulated through ligation of cd3ε, revealed induction of a strong band of <dig> kda and a weaker band of <dig> kda reactive with tsad antibody after <dig> and <dig> hours of stimulation. the <dig> kda band is induced in parallel with the <dig> kda tsad reactive band and is inhibited similar to tsad in cd4+ t cells transfected with sirna prior to cd <dig> stimulation . taken together, these results suggest that different isoforms of tsad are expressed in cd4+ t cells, and that tsad in cd <dig> stimulated cd4+ t cells is not controlled through the differential expression of tsad transcript variants. the tsad n-terminus modifies phosphorylation of tsad in jurkat t cells we then tested whether tsad variants encoded by the sh2d2a gene displayed distinct functional properties. tsad is phosphorylated upon tyrosines after cd <dig> stimulation <cit> and lck has been identified as a kinase that is able to interact with and phosphorylate tsad <cit> . we therefore assessed tyrosine phosphorylation of ha-tagged tsad variants transiently expressed in jurkat t cells before and after anti-cd <dig> stimulation. in comparison with full length tsad , tsad molecules with shortened n-terminus , displayed 2– <dig> fold higher levels of phosphorylation both in resting and cd <dig> stimulated jurkat t cells . both variants were tyrosine phosphorylated when co-expressed with lck in 293t cells . these results suggest that the n-terminal <dig> amino acids of tsad harbours information that either modify tsad interaction with lck or other kinases within jurkat t cells, or that the n-terminus contains some localisation signal, that when absent makes tsad more accessible for particular tyrosine kinase activity within the jurkat t cell. tsad with aberrant sh <dig> domain is not phosphorylated by lck several lines of evidence indicate that tsad in addition to lck may be tyrosine phosphorylated by other kinases, including src <cit> , vegfr- <dig> <cit> , pdgfr <cit> and zap- <dig> <cit> . tsad with an aberrant sh <dig> domain displayed a similar phosphorylation level as full length tsad when expressed in jurkat t cells . we previously showed that truncated tsad lacking the n-terminal aa 1– <dig> including tsad sh <dig> domain, is phosphorylated by lck when co-expressed in 293t cells <cit> . however, surprisingly as shown in figure 3b, when expressed in 293t cells, lck did not phosphorylate the sh2d2a- <dig> variant. this result is consistent with similar results obtained with tsad mutated for the conserved arginine in position <dig> in the sh <dig> domain . taken together, these results indicate that although the c-terminus of tsad is sufficient for phosphorylation of tsad by lck, in non-t-cells there is a requirement for an intact sh <dig> domain for lck mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the full length tsad. tsad aa239– <dig> controls tyrosine phosphorylation of tsad tsad lacking aa239– <dig> was not tyrosine phosphorylated in jurkat t cells, nor in 293t cells when co-expressed with lck . this indicates that aa239– <dig> harbors one or more tyrosine phosphorylation sites, or motifs crucial for interaction of tsad with lck or other tyrosine kinases. indeed a scansite search <cit> identified several potential lck-sh <dig> and lck-sh <dig> interaction motifs within the tsad aa239– <dig> <cit> . to specifically test whether one or more of the four tyrosines in the aa239– <dig> sequence could be phosphorylated by lck, we thus generated a tsad mutant with all four tyrosines mutated to phenylalanine . we also generated a tsad mutant where a putative lck-sh <dig> interaction site at aa239– <dig> was deleted . when transiently co-expressed with lck in 293t cells tsad-d239– <dig> was still phosphorylated on tyrosine, whereas tsad-4yf was only very weakly phosphorylated . tsad aa239– <dig> and the tsad-sh <dig> domain mediate interaction with lck we previously demonstrated that tsad interacts with lck in jurkat t cells stably expressing ha-tagged tsad <cit> . here we demonstrate that endogenous tsad interacts with lck in cd3/cd <dig> stimulated human peripheral blood cd4+ t cells . in jurkat transient transfectants, lck co-precipitates with tsad variants 1– <dig> . upon longer exposure, a weak lck band can also be seen in immunoprecipitates of tsad lacking aa239– <dig> . in pull down experiments, lck-sh <dig> domain binds to full length tsad and tsad with truncated n-terminus but only when co-expressed with lck . furthermore, the lck-sh <dig> domain could precipitate all tsad variants except for tsad lacking aa239– <dig> . similar pull down experiments using the tsad-4yf and tsad d239– <dig> mutants showed that lck-sh <dig> domain interaction is dependent on the aa239– <dig> whereas the lck-sh <dig> domain interaction is dependent on one or more of the four tyrosines within aa239– <dig> . finally, and consistent with the weak co-immunoprecipitation of lck seen with tsad aa239– <dig> the tsad-sh <dig> domain interacted with lck in pull down experiments . taken together, these data are in accordance with our previous observation that interaction of tsad with the lck sh <dig> and the lck sh <dig> domains requires the c-terminus of tsad <cit> and strongly suggests that the aa239– <dig> is of major importance for tsad interaction with lck in vivo. furthermore, phosphorylation of tsad by lck is dependent on the presence of one or more of the four c-terminal tyrosines whereas the lck-sh <dig> interaction site is dispensable. tyrosines in tsad aa239– <dig> confer the modulatory effect of tsad on lck activity we have previously reported that tsad inhibits early t cell signalling by inhibiting lck activity <cit> . lck is the first kinase to become activated after triggering of the tcr. phosphorylation of the itams of cd3ζ recruits zap- <dig> and zap- <dig> y <dig> becomes phosphorylated by lck or fyn <cit> . zap- <dig> thus activated subsequently phosphorylates the transmembrane adapter lat <cit> . phosphorylation of zap- <dig> y <dig> and lat in resting and stimulated t cells can thus be viewed as indirect measures of lck activity within the cell. immunoblots of cell lysates from cd3ε stimulated jurkat cells transiently transfected with sh2d2a variants 1– <dig> showed decreased phosphorylation of zap- <dig> y <dig> and lat, whereas in cells expressing the sh2d2a- <dig> variant or tsad-4yf no change in y <dig> or lat phosphorylation was observed . taken together, these data show that the tyrosines in tsad aa239– <dig> is essential not only for tsad phosphorylation by and interaction with lck, but also the modulating effect of tsad on lck activity. nuclear localisation of tsad depends on the tsad-sh <dig> domain as well as aa239–334 the localisation of tsad was initially found to be cytosolic <cit> , but was later also shown to be nuclear in activated t cells. tsad was thus proposed to play a role in transcriptional regulation <cit> . here we used immunocytochemistry to assess the intracellular localisation of ha-tagged tsad variants transiently expressed in jurkat tag cells. the nuclear membrane protein lap- <dig> was used as a marker for the nuclear membrane. similar to full length tsad, n-terminally truncated tsad variants were localised both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. in contrast, tsad with disrupted sh <dig> domain or tsad without aa239– <dig> were only found in the cytoplasm . thus nuclear localisation of tsad depends not only on the tsad-sh <dig> domain <cit> but also on the tsad c-terminal sequence aa239– <dig> discussion alternative transcription may extend the repertoire of functionally different proteins expressed from one single gene. in this study, alternative transcript variants of sh2d2a were used as a tool to identify functionally relevant structures of tsad. we found that tsad variants displayed different functional features, indicating that differential expression of sh2d2a transcript variants may contribute to the regulation of tsad function. our findings are summarised in figure 7a. we revealed a prominent role for aa239– <dig> encoded by sh2d2a exon <dig> in controlling tsad interaction with lck, modulation of proximal tcr signalling as well as translocation of tsad to the nucleus, indicating that tsad function may be regulated through alternative splicing of exon <dig> in addition, the tsad n-terminus and the sh <dig> domain affected tsad phosphorylation by lck. in support of the notion that tsad aa239– <dig> is important for tsad function, a high stringency scansite search <cit> of possible protein interaction motifs in tsad encoded by sh2d2a- <dig> revealed that several possible ligands for sh <dig> and sh <dig> domains, as well as tyrosine kinase substrates are encoded by exon <dig> and are thus contained within aa239– <dig> . a low stringency search also revealed one possible sh <dig> and several possible sh <dig> interaction sites encoded outside of exon <dig> . however, a scansite search is limited in that functionally relevant motifs may not appear in searches using the motif algorithms currently available. in particular, although our present studies indicate a role for the n-terminus in modulating tsad tyrosine phosphorylation, no interaction motif is found by scansite in the tsad n-terminus. the motif database underlying scansite searches are based on high affinity interactions as determined by selection of peptides from expression libraries. recently, peptides representing all cytoplasmic phosphorylation sites of the four members of the egfr receptor family were tested for binding to all sh <dig> domains in the genome using plasmon resonance <cit> . in those instances where a consensus sh <dig> domain binding motif was available in scansite, there were only partial overlap between the egfr motives predicted from scansite analysis and the egfr motives found to bind to the recombinant sh <dig> domains <cit> . it thus remains to be determined whether tsad encoded by sh2d2a- <dig> is able to interact with other proteins in an sh <dig> domain independent manner. previous studies on tsad and murine homologue lad supports the notion that motives in the aa239– <dig> are functionally important. we previously reported that lck activity is modulated by the c-terminus of tsad <cit> , and choi et al reported that the isolated lad-sh <dig> domain is unable to modulate lck activity <cit> . recently marti et al reported that both the three c-terminus lad tyrosines and a predicted lck-sh <dig> interaction site in the c-terminal of lad influenced lad modulation of lck activity <cit> . moreover, grb <dig> interacts with lad y <dig> , and y <dig> and y <dig> mediates pdgf induced ap- <dig> transcriptional activity <cit> . thus, taken together these previous studies as well as the present study strongly point to a role for tsad aa239–aa <dig> in control of various functions of tsad. differential regulation of the expression of functionally distinct alternate transcripts from a single gene may contribute to the regulation of the gene's function. we found that the alternative tsad transcripts may constitute up to 15–30% of the total amount of sh2d2a mrna in the cd4+ t cell. at the protein level, we showed that in cd4+ t cells, although the full length tsad <dig> kda band dominate, also tsad of <dig> kda lacking the aa239– <dig> is expressed. however, we did not reliably observe protein bands representing n-terminally truncated tsad variants. when expressed in jurkat t cells or 293t cells, each of the sh2d2a cdnas produced tsad molecules of expected lengths , indicating that all tsad variant mrnas encoded by the plasmid constructs were also translated. when co-transfecting jurkat t cells with sh2d2a- <dig> cdna together with 10% of the amount of sh2d2a- <dig> cdna, we were not able to detect the sh2d2a- <dig> protein band on western blots, although the sh2d2a- <dig> cdna when transfected alone did reveal a distinct protein band of expected length . this indicates that the n-terminally truncated tsad molecules fall below the detection limit of global tsad western blot analysis. in order to directly assess the expression of variant tsad molecules antibodies specifically recognizing one but not any of the other tsad molecules must be generated. however, the sequence differences between the various tsad molecules are minimal, and the predicted antigenicity as assessed by the program \"antigenic\" of the emboss suite <cit> of the n-terminal tsad amino acids, as well as the exon 6– <dig> boundary is not favourable. at present it is therefore not possible to determine to what extent these transcript variants are also represented at the protein level. we were not able to demonstrate differential regulation of the different alternate transcripts of the sh2d2a gene in anti-cd <dig> stimulated cd4+ t cells. however, we have only examined expression of tsad transcripts in one cell type under one stimulatory regimen. physiological t cell activation also requires the presence of co-stimulatory signals delivered through cd28-b <dig> interactions. in addition, tsad mrna expression may be induced in cd4+ t cells via camp dependent signals <cit> . since the initial cloning and characterisation of tsad <cit> , tsad has also been found to be expressed in endothelial <cit> and epithelial cells <cit> . it is possible that the pattern of sh2d2a transcripts differ in these cells. the importance of the sh <dig> domain for nuclear translocation of tsad was previously pointed out by marti et al <cit> . here we extend these data by showing that also the aa239– <dig> of tsad is necessary for translocation of tsad to the nucleus. tsad does not contain a nuclear localisation signal, but are associated with the molecular chaperone valocin-containing protein/p <dig> , and this interaction is thought to be necessary for translocation of tsad to the nucleus <cit> . how tsad interacts physically with vcp is not yet known. the isolated tsad-sh <dig> domain has been shown to be translocated to the nucleus <cit> . it is however conceivable that the intact tsad molecule may have different requirements for interaction with vcp and translocation to the nucleus, as indicated by our observation that truncated tsad with intact sh <dig> domain fails to be translocated to the nucleus. the <dig> aa insertion in the sh <dig> domain of the tsad protein encoded by the sh2d2a- <dig> cdna probably result in a misfolded sh <dig> domain. this variant behaved like tsad harbouring in vitro generated point mutation of the conserved arginine in the sh <dig> domain supporting this notion. the sh2d2a- <dig> transcript was not consistently observed in quantitative pcr analysis of anti-cd <dig> stimulated cd4+ t cells, and it is thus probably expressed at very low levels in t cells. taken together, this indicates that the sh2d2a- <dig> transcript has no functional relevance in the cell and probably represents transcriptional noise. CONCLUSIONS we have demonstrated functional differences between tsad molecules encoded by alternative transcript variants of the sh2d2a gene, and these studies have pointed out a crucial role for aa239– <dig> encoded by exon <dig> in mediating tsad function . further studies are needed to assess to what extent differential regulation of the alternate sh2d2a transcripts may contribute to the regulation of tsad function in t cells and other cell types.",

RESULTS determination of spinal water content after ir injury figure 1a showed spinal water content in rats of sham and ir group evaluated by dry-wet method during 60 h post-injury. there were significant increases in water content in ir group at all observed time points , suggesting development of spinal cord swelling induced by 14-min of thoracic aortic occlusion. similar to the bimodal disruption of bscb, quantitative data appeared to be a m-shape curve with first peak at 12 h and lessened from 18 h, then aggravated again beginning at 36 h and reached the second peak at 48 h and afterwards. on the other hand, water content in sham group maintained almost the same level during all observed time points .fig. <dig> a spinal water content evaluated by dry-net method after spinal cord ir injury during 60 h post-injury. maximal difference of water content between sham and ir group were observed at <dig> and 48 h afterwards, suggesting bimodal damage of spinal cord after ir. **p

showed almost normal bbb structure of bscb as that of sham group. c at 12 h after ir, cytotoxic edema began to appear with thickened basilar membranes but intact endothelial tj . the capillary lumen became irregular in shape and the vacuoles also appeared in the cytoplasm of the astrocytes and capillary endothelial cells. d at 48 h after ir, mixed edema occurred with obvious abnormal structure as breakdown of endothelial tj and more apparent astrocyte swelling . l, capillary lumen. scale bar 1 mm pathological changes in bscb after ir injury our recent study has demonstrated that bimodal disruption of bscb was occurred at <dig> and 48 h after injury in a rat model of spinal cord ir injury <cit> . based on previous work, we estimated that different edema formation such as cytotoxic and/or vasogenic spinal edema might be involved in the process of bscb integrity damage and examined by transmission electron microscope . our observation revealed that at 12 h after ir, cytotoxic edema began to appear with the presence of glial cell foot process swelling and thickened basilar membranes but intact endothelial tj, whereas at 48 h after ir, angioedema appeared consecutively as breakdown of endothelial tj and vascular basal lamina with more apparent cell swelling, suggesting the formation of mixed edema. moreover, there was no abnormal morphology of bscb structure in ir group at 6 h and in sham group at all observed time points . effects of aqp <dig> expression and colocalization with different cell types of bscb in spinal cord after ir compared to sham group, the protein expressions of aqp <dig> in spinal cords of ir group gradually increased with time and maintained a dramatically high level after 48 h post-injury . there were no significant differences between these two groups at 6 h after surgery.fig. <dig> temporal relationship of aqp <dig> expressions in spine cord after ir injury. a western blot analysis of aqp <dig> expression at different

<dig> upregulation in astrocytes appeared at the early phase of bscb dysfunction and endothelial cells emerged with the development of injury, but no identical fluorescence label of aqp <dig> was found in microglial cells immunofluorescent stain was only performed at <dig> and 48 h as bscb dysfunction was suggested to reach maximal level at these two time points. it was correlated well with spinal cord swelling <cit> . continuous capillary endothelial cells, astrocytes, and perivascular microglia are the major cellular components of the bscb. with the understanding that aqp <dig> may play an important role in maintaining water homeostasis and bscb integrity, we further identified a specific cell population in bscb with the following cellular markers: cd <dig> , gfap and iba- <dig> . based on our results, at 12 h after surgery, the majority of aqp <dig> was colocalized with the distribution of astrocytes in ir group, whereas at 48 h, most colocalization was focused on both endothelial cells and astrocytes, but not in microglial cells and all cell types in sham-operated ones. it suggested that ir-induced aqp <dig> upregulation in astrocytes appeared at the early phase of bscb dysfunction and endothelial cells emerged with the development of injury. quantification data of double-labeled cells with aqp <dig> in fig. 2d showed similar results. however, no identical fluorescence label of aqp <dig> was found in microglial cells of rats undergoing ir or sham-operation at the above time points. screening of mirnas targeting aqp <dig> mrna 3′utr after ir we performed microarray analysis and bioinformatic search to determine whether there were potential mirs involved in regulation aqp <dig> mrna after ir. the results showed that compared with sham group, in ir group, ten mirs were upregulated and seven mirs were downregulated at 12 h after surgery , and ten mirs were upregulated and eleven mirs were downregulated at 48 h after surgery . among these aberrant mirnas, ten mirs were reported to be differentially expressed at both <dig> and 48 h after ir. further searching about mirs in targetscan and microcosm targets databases showed that only mir-320a was highly complementary to the 3′-utr of aqp <dig> and hypothesized to target their transcripts. the results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mir-320a was expressed at significantly low level after ir and continuously decreased with time . then the potential link was demonstrated by dual luciferase reporter assay. we co-transfected hek- <dig> cells with luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 3′-utr of aqp <dig> and anti-mir-320a or pre-mir-320a. co-transfection with anti-mir-320a exhibited an increase in the relative luciferase expression, whereas pre-mir-320a strongly inhibited luciferase activity. moreover, no effects were observed in cells transfected with mutated mir-320a binding site of aqp <dig> . collectively, these results indicated that mir-320a could directly target aqp <dig> and their interactions would be further verified in a rat ir model.fig. <dig> screening of mirnas targeting aqp <dig> mrna 3′utr after ir. a hierarchical

by rt-pcr and western blotting, respectively. as shown in fig. <dig> compared with sham group, intrathecal injection with mimic-320a significantly prevented ir-induced increases in aqp <dig> mrna and protein expressions at <dig> and 48 h after ir, whereas pretreatment with amo-320a reversed above changes . there were no significant differences between ir group and nc-320a group at above time points .fig. <dig> effects of intrathecal injection of mir-320a mimics and amo on expressions of aqp <dig> in a rat ir modal. a representative western blot probed with antibodies against aqp <dig> and

ranged from <dig> to <dig> during 48 h after reperfusion. there were significant decreases in average tarlov scores in ir group , suggesting the development of motor function deficits induced by ir.

observed in rats without subjected to aortic arch occlusion at both <dig> and 48 h after ir. compared with sham group, ir caused markedly increases in the amount of eb extravasation and fluorescent densities at <dig> and 48 h after ir . intrathecal pretreatment with mir-320a mimic significantly weakened eb extravasation and fluorescent densities, and conversely much more eb, especially in the gray matter could be seen in rats pretreated with amo-320a at above time points . there were no detectable differences in eb extravasation between the ir group and nc-320a group . discussion spinal cord edema is one of the most serious complications following spinal cord ir injury that closely associated with long-term disability in patients or even death <cit> . pathologically speaking, spinal cord edema is a result of increased spinal water content due to excess accumulation of water in the intracellular or extracellular spaces from the dysfunction of bscb <cit> . our previous work has reported that ir-induced bimodal disruption of bscb and exhibited more pronounced vascular disruptions at 48 h than those at 12 h after surgery. <cit> . in this study, we further identified the factors that modulating bscb integrity and found endogenous modulator to retard the spinal cord edema progression. bscb is comprised of the cells and cellular elements <cit> . based on the morphological and structural change of bscb, spinal cord edema is mainly divided into cytotoxic edema and vasogenic edema , and both can be initiated by trauma, ischemia and inflammation <cit> . it is known that cytotoxic edema causes perivascular glial endfeets swelling for simply a water shift from extracellular to intracellular compartments, and eventually breakdown of endothelial tjs and vascular basal lamina allows for extravasated warer ultrafiltrate and formation of vasogenic edema <cit> . to confirm the above conclusion, our pathological observation by tem showed that at 12 h after ir, cytotoxic edema was detected with presence of glial cell foot process swelling and thickened basilar membranes but intact endothelial tj, whereas at 48 h, two kinds of edema formed mixed edema with presence of both breakdown of cellular elements and more apparent cell swelling. besides, spinal water content gradually increased at 12 h and dramatically increased over 48 h , such observation was consistent with the study of stokum et al. <cit> . they suggested that cytotoxic edema by itself did not cause similar increases in tissue volume or mass as those by vasogenic edema in brain. lu hong’s study was also designed to employ the relationship of traumatic brain edema and bbb structure <cit> . they showed that vasogenic edema was characterized by structural bbb damage, such as endothelial cell and mitochondrial swelling, basilar membrane abruption, as well as dilatation of endoplasmic reticulum. the bbb damaged could be aggravated by mixed cerebral edema that consisting of vasogenic edema and cellular edema with prolonged times <cit> . spinal cord edema is often long lasting and resistant to therapeutic intervention and thus the mechanisms that promote water flux across bscb is worth further investigating <cit> . previous studies showed deregulated expressions of water-channel protein aquaporins anchoring at the perivascular membrane frequently led to a net loss of bscb and parallel increases in spinal water content <cit> . given the involvement of aqp <dig> in cerebral edema , we first examined temporal expressions of aqp <dig> during the time course of ir injury by western blot . studies have confirmed that upregulation of aqp <dig> may participate in vasogenic edema formation <cit> . similarly, the protein level of aqp <dig> was gradually increasing during the early phase of bimodal disruption but dramatically increased after 48 h afterwards, providing potential molecular mechanisms of the generation vasogenic edema during the second disruption of bscb. another study of vasogenic edema formation also confirmed that aqp <dig> gene knockout rats exhibited a 56 % reduction in blood-cerebrospinal fluid versus wild-type mice under isomolar conditions <cit> . to better contextualize their contribution to vasogenic or cytotoxic edema, we further explore the collocation of aqps with specific cellular compositions of bscb during bimodal bscb disruption. the results showed that gfap staining started to increase in number of cells and enhance staining intensities with time and peaked at <dig> and 48 h after ir, whereas the cd <dig> staining became greatly increased at 48 h. to explain the different activation phases of astrocytes and endothelial cells, one can easily considered that different degrees of bscb leakage and different types of edema conformation involved. furthermore, the quantitative analysis showed aqp <dig> was mainly expressed in astrocytes during early cytotoxic edema, while during later mixed edema, aqp <dig> was expressed both in endothelial cells and astrocytes, confirming that endothelial cells participated in vasogenic edema formation. previous studies have supported the existence of species specificity of aqps localization in nervous system <cit> . for instance, several reports demonstrate that aqp <dig> was highly co-distributed in human astrocytes and specialized for water transport both in vitro and in vivo under the pathological condition <cit> . on the other hand, most aqp <dig> was restricted to endothelial cells of blood vessels and choroid plexus to control cerebral spinal fluid secretion <cit> . these findings, together with the present results, suggested that the essential role of aqp <dig> in regulating water transport and balance during bimodal disruption of bscb after ir. aberrant expressions of aqp <dig> might induce a sustained imbalance of water influx and efflux during reperfusion and finally lead to bscb disruption. enhanced aqp <dig> has been demonstrated as a primary factor for the water transport and associated with persistent edema following hypoxia <cit> . factors that reducing the aqp <dig> expression after ir would necessarily maintain bscb integrity and inhibit the spread of edema to improve the prognosis. mirs are single-stranded rna that function as negative regulators of gene expression by either the translational repression or degradation of mrna targets . aberrant mirna expression has been proposed as therapeutic targets in the pathogenesis of ir <cit> . in these analyses, no changes in luciferase activity were detected when mutated reporter was co-transfected with either pre- or anti-mir, suggesting that aqp <dig> was genuine targets of mir-320a . it has been known that single mir is capable of regulating expressions of various target genes, in converse, one target gene can be regulated by several mirs . thus, to verify the effects of mir-320a on the edema-associated outcome was required to be tested in vivo. it was recently shown that intrathecal injection with mir mimics and amos into the subarachnoid space was a common and useful method to regulate the mirs expressions in animal model <cit> . in vivo data also showed that intrathecal pretreatment with mimic-320a clearly reduced the mrna and protein expressions of aqp <dig> by compensating for decreased mir-320a levels, whereas injection with amo-320a clearly abrogated such changes. further, no obvious changes were detected when pretreated with negative control mirs, suggesting that mir-320a directly modulated aqp <dig> both in vitro and in vivo. sepramaniam et al. <cit> suggested that spinal cord injury -induced a mixture of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema involved different mechanisms. given the complexity of mixed edema during second disruption of bscb, we thus focused on 48 h post-injury to determine the net effects of mir-320a during ir in vivo. it showed that ir induced by 14-min aortic arch occlusion produced severe hind-limb motor functional deficits, along with increased bscb leakage. our present study provided clear evidence for the protective effects of mir-320a on neurological outcomes and bscb permeability. specifically, increasing mir-320a expression by intrathecal injection of mir mimics increased average tarlov scores, reduced fluorescent dye and eb extravasation, whereas above effects were reversed by injection of amo. we suggested that protective effects of aqp <dig> deletion during mixed edema were likely contributed to maintain bscb integrity by mitigating astrocytes swelling, removal of excess water through glial and endothelial barriers <cit> . of note, one major character of mirs is that single mir is capable of regulating many target genes through recognition of a continuous 6-base pair “seed match” near the 3′-utr of its targets <cit> . given this, many target genes of mir-320a have been identified. apart from regulating structure of bscb, some studies have showed that protective effects of mir- <dig> involved in regulation heat shock protein- <dig> by inhibiting apoptosis during ir <cit> . since multiple mechanisms involved in neuroprotection after ir and complicated internal environment of in vivo experiments, it is very possible to gain different or even contradictory net effects when exploring the same mir in differently experimental conditions. further in vitro and in vivo studies still need to be conducted to better elucidate the mechanisms and provide therapeutic targets for spinal cord edema. CONCLUSIONS we have identified that mir-320a directly and functionally modulated aqp <dig> expression in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. inhibition of aqp <dig> might provide a new therapeutic alternative for maintenance of bscb integrity and treatment of spinal edema.",

RESULTS the rice gw <dig> gene has two co-orthologs located on duplicated chromosomes in maize blast searches with the rice gw <dig> protein sequence against the maize high throughput genomic sequence database <cit> identified two maize bacterial artificial chromosome clones, ac <dig> on chromosome <dig> and ac <dig> on chromosome <dig> that contain sequences showing high similarity to the rice protein. the structures of these two genes were determined using three maize complementary dna clones from genbank, eu <dig> fj <dig> and eu <dig> which showed high sequence similarity to the two bac clones. both genes consist of eight exons, with an overall sequence similarity of 94% to each other and 93% to the rice gw <dig> gene across the coding region. they were named zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> based on their locations on the maize chromosomes . because the maize genome has been shown to be replete with duplicated chromosomal regions <cit> , we investigated if the two homologs represent duplicated genes. as shown in figure 1a, other gene sequences in the vicinity of the two maize genes also show high similarity, as would arise following an ancient chromosome duplication event. comparison of the regions around both maize genes with the region containing rice gw <dig> showed that both maize regions are collinear with the rice region, indicating that the two maize genes are co-orthologs of the rice gw <dig> gene. besides, compared to the rice region containing gw <dig> both maize regions contain an inversion . phylogenetic analysis of the duplicated maize genes and their corresponding counterparts in sorghum, rice and barley showed that zmgw2-chr <dig> is more closely related to the sorghum counterpart than to the other maize copy , indicating that sequence divergence has occurred between the two maize genes. to identify the fixed polymorphic sites between the maize genes, we sequenced the coding regions of both genes in eight diverse maize lines belonging to five heterotic groups. in total, we found <dig> fixed sites, of which <dig> were synonymous mutations . all polymorphisms but two were snps. the <dig> sites are not evenly distributed across the entire coding region, as 60% of the polymorphisms occurred in exon <dig> and no polymorphisms were found in exon <dig> . only three snps were found in the ring domain, all of which were synonymous mutations, suggesting that this domain may have a conserved function in both genes. e, exon a including a <dig> bp indel b the location of the ring domain, which begins from within the end of exon <dig> and extends to within the beginning of exon <dig> c including a <dig> bp indel zmgw2-chr <dig> is located within a qtl for hkw zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> were located in maize chromosomal bins <dig> and <dig> , respectively. previous studies have mapped many qtl for kernel weight to these two regions . in particular, in an f2: <dig> population <cit> and an immortalized f <dig> population developed by our lab at the china agricultural university <cit> , a qtl for hkw was mapped to bin <dig> . zmgw2-chr <dig> was mapped to <dig> cm on chromosome <dig> between simple sequence repeat markers bnlg <dig> and umc <dig> and within the qtl confidence interval for hkw, near the left border of the qtl . this qtl was identified stably across four seasons and explained <dig> % to <dig> % of the phenotypic variation in the if <dig> population derived from inbred lines zong <dig> and 87- <dig> the zong <dig> allele can increase hkw from <dig> to <dig> g . although the large qtl confidence interval contained lots of genes, the involvement of gw <dig> in hkw in rice and the co-location of zmgw2-chr <dig> with this qtl indicated that zmgw2-chr <dig> is a good candidate for this qtl and may be involved in grain weight variation. <dig> year 2003; <dig> year 2004; bj, beijing; xx, xunxian a positive values indicate that the zong <dig> allele increases hkw b positive values indicate that the heterozygote has higher phenotypic value than the mean of the two homozygotes c phenotypic variation explained by each qtl genetic diversity and ld of the two genes across maize inbred lines the genetic diversity within the ring domain was not analyzed because it is well conserved across the two maize genes . instead, we analyzed three regions of comparable sizes in corresponding regions of the two maize genes . the average levels of nucleotide diversity in the two genes are comparable, both having about <dig> nucleotide differences per <dig> sites between two random sequences across the entire genes . however, the nucleotide diversity is not evenly distributed across both genes. while the 5' end showed the most abundant diversity in zmgw2-chr <dig> , this region showed the fewest polymorphisms in zmgw2-chr <dig> . the middle portion of zmgw2-chr <dig> has only two polymorphisms, while the corresponding region of zmgw2-chr <dig> has <dig> polymorphisms and the highest level of genetic diversity. tajima's d statistic was calculated to determine whether the two genes were subjected to selective constraints. as shown in table <dig> it appears that neither gene has been the subject of natural selection when the entire gene sequences were analyzed. because the selection effect may not extend throughout the entire gene <cit> , we calculated tajima's d statistic separately for the three regions in each gene. the results showed that the middle portion of zmgw2-chr <dig> has a significant positive tajima's d value, suggesting the presence of selection at this region, which is consistent with the observed low level of nucleotide diversity . *, p < <dig> a the number of analyzed maize inbred lines b the total number of sites c the number of segregating sites d the number of haplotypes e the number of nucleotide differences per site between two randomly chosen sequences f the d value calculated according to the polymorphic sites the ld decay patterns of the two genes shown in figures <dig> and <dig> indicate that both genes contain discrete ld blocks. in zmgw2-chr <dig> a large ld block was observed at the 5' end , and in zmgw2-chr <dig> a large ld block was observed in the middle portion . the only two polymorphisms in the middle portion of zmgw2-chr <dig> are in complete ld; thus, only two haplotypes were observed , consistent with the observed selection and reduced nucleotide diversity in this region. although ld extends in each of the three regions in both genes , ld among the three regions within both genes was within <dig> bp , consistent with previous results <cit> . we further investigated ld between the two genes, only <dig> % of r <dig> values for all pairs of polymorphisms was greater than <dig> , and the largest r <dig> was less than <dig> . association analysis of four yield-related traits analysis of variance showed significant phenotypic variation for all four yield-related traits among the maize lines studied , indicating that the assembled panel is suitable for association analysis. a significant year by genotype effect was observed for all four traits. the phenotypic distributions ranged from <dig> to <dig> mm for kl, <dig> to <dig> mm for kw, <dig> to <dig> mm for kt and <dig> to <dig> g for hkw; with an average of <dig> mm, <dig> mm, <dig> mm and <dig> g, respectively . significant positive phenotypic and genetic correlations between kw and kt, and between kernel size traits and hkw were observed , indicating that an increase in any of the three kernel size traits can increase hkw, and thus perhaps grain yield. df, degree of freedom; hkw, one-hundred kernel weight; kl, kernel length; kt, kernel thickness; kw, kernel width; **, p < <dig> ; *, p < <dig> a because the phenotypic values for some lines were missing either for kernel size or for kernel weight, the df are different. the numbers in parentheses indicate the df for hkw and the numbers outside parentheses indicate the df for kl, kt and kw b the numbers above the diagonal are genetic correlation coefficients and the numbers below the diagonal are phenotypic correlation coefficients the mixed model controlling for population structure and kinship as estimated using molecular markers <cit> was employed to test associations between the four yield-related traits and polymorphisms from the two maize genes. out of <dig> and <dig> possible associations , <dig> and <dig> associations were significant for zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> respectively, at p ≤ <dig> ; while at p ≤ <dig> , <dig> and <dig> associations remained significant, indicating that the observed associations were not expected only by chance. taking the ld level among sites into account, seven and five sites from zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> respectively, were significantly associated with at least one of the four yield-related traits at p ≤ <dig> . information on the location, genotype, frequency and probability value for each site can be found in tables <dig> and <dig> the s <dig> site from zmgw2-chr <dig> was of great interest because it showed associations with kw and hkw across all three field experiments , and explained <dig> % and <dig> % of the phenotypic variation for kw and hkw, respectively in beijing in <dig> this site also segregated in the if <dig> population and mapped to a region where a qtl for hkw was identified . three other sites from zmgw2-chr <dig> and one site from zmgw2-chr <dig> were significantly associated with kw in two out of the three field experiments; and sites s <dig> from zmgw2-chr <dig> and s <dig> from zmgw2-chr <dig> showed significant effects on kt in two out of the three field experiments. other trait/site associations identified in this study were

significant polymorphisms associated with hkw from zmgw2-chr <dig> four segregated in the if <dig> population and could be tested. in the association panel, all four favourable alleles are from the inbred line 87- <dig> , while in the if <dig> population, the allele that increases hkw is from the other parent, zong <dig> . for zmgw2-chr <dig> we did not detect any qtl for hkw in its vicinity in the if <dig> population. consistent with this result, the only polymorphism that showed significant association with hkw in the association panel did not segregate in the if <dig> population . expression analyses of the two maize genes real-time quantitative reverse transcription pcr of <dig> different tissues was performed to address whether the two maize genes had diverged expression patterns and whether these patterns were associated with a role in kernel development. as shown in figure 5a, expression trends of the two genes were quite similar, with a correlation coefficient of <dig> , indicating no divergence between the two genes in the tissues examined. the highest expression levels were observed in immature ears for both genes, and expression levels were reduced in kernels after pollination, suggesting a role in kernel development. correlation analysis between the expression levels of the two genes and the four traits across <dig> maize inbred lines showed that zmgw2-chr <dig> transcript abundance was negatively correlated with kw . however, despite the correlation between kw and the expression level of zmgw2-chr <dig> and the association between kw and six zmgw2-chr <dig> polymorphisms , none of these polymorphisms affected the expression level of zmgw2-chr <dig> no significant correlations were observed between zmgw2-chr <dig> transcript levels and any of the four traits. discussion evolution of the two maize genes the collinear relationship between the rice region containing gw <dig> and the maize regions containing zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> suggested that the two maize genes are duplicated genes and both of them are co-orthologs of rice gw <dig> . previous studies consistently showed that maize has a segmental allotetraploid origin, in which the maize genome was thought to have arisen through hybridization of two ancestral diploids whose genomes had partially diverged, one of which shares a more recent common ancestor with the sorghum genome <cit> . to clarify the relationship of the gw <dig> genes in maize and sorghum, we performed phylogenetic analysis with the gw <dig> protein sequences, which showed that zmgw2-chr <dig> is more closely related to its counterpart in sorghum than to zmgw2-chr <dig> . this finding supports the segmental allotetraploid origin of maize, and indicates that the two maize genes may have evolved independently for a period of time <cit> . three processes have been proposed to explain the evolutionary fates of duplicated genes within a species: non-functionalization, neo-functionalization and sub-functionalization. in non-functionalization, one of the duplicates accumulates deleterious mutations and eventually degenerates to a pseudogene or is lost from the genome <cit> . occasionally, mutations in regulatory or coding regions can lead to novel gene function <cit> . alternatively, both genes may experience some degeneration and lose partial functionality, but can complement each other . this can occur through partition of either protein domains or regulatory elements of the ancestral gene <cit> . sequence analyses showed that zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> are highly conserved, with an overall similarity of 94% across the coding region. none of the mutations in either gene led to truncated proteins, and no non-synonymous nucleotide changes were observed in the ring domain. additionally, both genes are expressed across various tissues. thus, neither of the genes has experienced a non-functionalization process. to assess if neo-functionalization and sub-functionalization have occurred, previous knowledge of the ancestral gene's function is required, which is usually unavailable. besides, both processes can occur through changes in regulatory or coding regions. therefore, we tested and distinguished the two processes by investigating whether reciprocal degenerations have occurred. for example, if one gene was expressed in roots and silenced in leaves, sub-functionalization requires that the other gene must be silenced in roots and expressed in leaves ; while neo-functionalization requires that the other gene must be silenced in both tissues so that the expression in roots could be assumed to be a new function. in zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> the exon number, protein length and protein domain are all well conserved , with no protein domains lost or acquired, indicating that neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization through changes in the coding region had not occurred. we further investigated the expression patterns of the two genes across <dig> maize tissues . although the promoter regions of the two genes are highly divergent, both genes were expressed in all of the <dig> tissues and their expression levels were highly correlated , indicating that neither neo-functionalization nor sub-functionalization through changes in regulatory regions had occurred in the tissues examined. however, we could not exclude the possibility that the two genes may show divergent expression patterns under various environmental conditions or in specific cell types which have not been tested. genetic variations in zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> are associated with kernel size and weight in maize the orthologous relationship and high sequence conservation between the two maize genes and the rice gw <dig> suggest that zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> may perform similar functions as gw <dig> in rice. results from expression, linkage and association analyses corroborate this supposition. the expression levels of both maize genes varied according to the developmental stages of the ear or kernel , implying that they may be involved in ear or kernel development. this was further supported by association analysis. although the small size of the association mapping panel did not guarantee optimal power of association tests <cit> , both genes were found to contain polymorphisms affecting at least one of the four yield-related traits . two more lines of evidence were presented to support a role of zmgw2-chr <dig> in kernel size and weight. one came from qtl mapping results , which placed zmgw2-chr <dig> within the confidence interval of a consistent qtl for hkw. another came from the negative correlation between the expression levels of zmgw2-chr <dig> and kw , indicating that down-regulation of this gene may lead to elevated kw, and thus grain yield. this is consistent with the negative function of gw <dig> in rice, where a truncated protein leads to an increase in grain size and weight <cit> . previous study with another yield-related gene, gs <dig> showed that different polymorphisms underlie similar phenotypes in rice and maize <cit> . here, we report a similar phenomenon. in rice, a <dig> bp deletion in the fourth exon leads to a premature truncated protein and causes enhanced grain width and weight <cit> , while in maize, mutations in other regions of zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> cause those phenotypes . however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the <dig> bp deletion found in the rice gw <dig> gene also exists in maize, and would have been found if more lines are sequenced for these genes. moreover, the genetic polymorphisms that were associated with phenotypic variation for kernel size and weight are different between the two maize genes, indicating that they probably affect kernel size and weight through different mechanisms. in qtl analysis, the favourable allele for hkw is from the inbred line zong <dig> . in our association panel, the favourable alleles of all four polymorphisms that segregated in the qtl mapping population were from the other parental inbred line, 87- <dig> . three possible explanations may explain the discrepancy in the direction of allelic effects. one is that the associations are false positives created due to the possible presence of population structure and individual relatedness. the best statistical model to account for the effect of population structure and individual relatedness and control the false positive rate is the mixed linear model <cit> . this was the model used in this study, with which we found that one polymorphism was consistently associated with hkw across three different environments, and the direction of the allelic effect was the same across these environments . for complex traits, such as hkw, the consistent detection of a significant association across various environments using a well-performed statistical model implies that the associations are not false positives. a second possibility for the discrepancy is that we may not have identified the actual functional polymorphism, but rather only one linked to it. our evidence shows that zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> are associated with kernel size and weight in maize. however, it is still unclear what the actual causal polymorphism is in each case because association analysis based on ld can identify neutral polymorphisms in high ld with the actual functional polymorphism . when the detected polymorphism is in complete ld with the functional polymorphism, the favourable allele at the detected polymorphism can represent the favourable allele at the functional polymorphism completely. however, if recombination occurred between the two polymorphisms, some inbred lines would show a favourable allele at the detected polymorphism, but actually contain the unfavourable allele at the functional polymorphism. this cannot be detected in association analysis where the mean effects of all lines are measured, but can be detected in linkage analysis where only two lines are involved. a third possibility is the presence of other functional polymorphisms that we did not detect in the present study. the interval of a qtl usually spans 10- <dig> cm <cit> , and can contain more than one gene involved in the expression of the same trait in some cases <cit> . thus, the qtl effect actually represents the combined effect of all functional polymorphisms within the region. in the association analysis that included zong <dig> and 87- <dig> we detected favourable alleles in zmgw2-chr <dig> from 87- <dig> but if there were other unfavourable functional polymorphisms in zmgw2-chr <dig> or other possible genes within the qtl that were not measured in the association analysis, the mean effect would identify 87- <dig> as the unfavourable parent in the qtl mapping population. this is quite possible, because our correlation analysis also pointed to the presence of other functional polymorphisms. in this study, we found a significant negative correlation between the expression levels of zmgw2-chr <dig> and kw, but this correlation cannot be explained by the identified significant polymorphisms in the association analysis, implying the presence of other causal polymorphisms. these polymorphisms could be cis-acting elements far upstream of the genes, as in the case of tb <dig> <cit> . alternatively, they could be unknown trans-acting elements hidden in the genome, as have been reported in the maize genome <cit> . however, it is very difficult to identify upstream cis- or trans-acting elements using the candidate gene association analysis strategy. an alternative method to identify these elements and to further explore the genetic basis of complex quantitative traits is genome-wide association studies with high density marker coverage <cit> . CONCLUSIONS this study investigated the relationship, evolutionary fate and function of two maize genes involved in kernel size and weight. the two genes represent chromosomal duplicates that are co-orthologs of gw <dig> in rice. the sequences of both genes are well conserved, with no mutations leading to a pseudo-molecule, and no new protein motifs were found, suggesting that both genes may have conserved functions in maize. expression and candidate gene-based association analyses suggested that both genes play a role in kernel size and weight variation, as does rice gw <dig> however, the identified polymorphisms that contribute to phenotypic variation are different between the maize and rice genes and between the two maize genes, suggesting that the three genes may cause phenotypic variation through different mechanisms. mutant or transformation experiments would shed more light on this hypothesis. the conservation of function together with the diversification of mechanism among the three genes can help us to understand the similarities as well as the differences in the genetic basis of grain yield in rice and maize.",

RESULTS whole-genome sequencing of cultivated soybeans five soybean merr.) cultivar genomes were sequenced. two were parental cultivars , and two represented their crossed descendants and were used to detect inherited genome-wide recombination events. one of the descendants, daepoong, has the highest productivity among korean soybean cultivars with excellent yield stability. we also used another elite line, hwangkeum, which is not a member of this family but is popular for its attractive color and bean size. we produced paired-end dna reads of 40–60-fold depths for the five cultivar genomes and mapped them to the williams <dig> reference <cit> . the sequencing qualities of all the samples were high; 94%–99% of the cultivar sample reads were mapped to the reference, and 97%–99% of the reference genome was covered. a williams <dig> genome was also sequenced under the same conditions at a ~60-fold depth to reduce the base-calling noise. additionally, g. soja <cit> , which is an undomesticated ancestor of g. max, was used as a control and analyzed with the same method. comparative analysis procedure for cultivated soybean genomes using vb the main objective of the vb method is to compare the reshuffled genome sequences of bred cultivars. a three-step process was applied to determine and compare the recombination blocks in the five soybean genomes . • step <dig> snv detection: snvs and indels were detected by comparing bred soybean genomes with a reference genome . there were a total of <dig> , <dig> non-redundant snvs and a total of <dig> small indels in the five korean soybean cultivars . of these snvs, <dig> , <dig> were novel . the snvs were highly clustered in certain chromosomal regions, whereas the regions that were genomically identical to the williams <dig> reference showed few or no snvs. • step <dig> determination of vbs: two types of blocks were determined: the sparse variation blocks , which are identical or nearly identical to the reference sequence, and the dense variation blocks , which contain many variations . the boundaries of the dvbs and svbs were regarded as recombination sites. the vbs are thus defined as the sequence fragments that are split by all of the assumed recombination sites. in the five soybean genomes, 30–47% of the regions were dvbs . as expected, in the resequenced williams <dig> genome, only a fraction of the regions were dvbs, which appeared probably due to individual differences between the two williams <dig> cultivars. by contrast, most of the regions in the g. soja genome were dvbs, indicating that the genetic pool of g. soja has been rarely used to breed williams <dig> and the five cultivars that were sequenced in this study. most of the snvs were located in dvbs, even though the dvbs occupied less than half of the genome . a total of <dig> svbs and dvbs were identified in the five genomes, along with <dig> boundary sites that demarcated the vbs. figure <dig> shows an overview of the block structures of all of the chromosomes and the detailed structure of chromosome <dig> . after eliminating redundancy, a total of <dig> recombination sites and a set of <dig> vbs covered the entire genomic region . recombination occurs more frequently in gene-rich regions than in gene-sparse regions <cit> . consistent with this, we confirmed a strong positive correlation between the gene density and vb density in the soybean genome. as a result, short vbs were found mainly in regions with the highest gene densities , whereas most of the very long vbs were located in heterochromatic regions . this observation is consistent with previous studies that reported the suppression of recombination in the heterochromatin of various crops, such as sorghum and tomato <cit> . interestingly, there were identical variation patterns consistently appearing in the same regions of the examined genomes, indicating that these regions were inherited from common ancestors. the existence of boundaries that demarcate the dvbs and svbs indicates that recombination has occurred at least once during breeding.• step <dig> block comparison: the identity of each vb at specific locations was compared to all of the other vbs within the aligned column among the cultivar genomes . to compare the vbs among the genomes, two vbs were considered to be of an identical type and thus to have originated from a common parental genome when they had ≥ <dig> % sequence identity as well as ≥ <dig> snv concordance . snv concordance refers to the extent to which all the snvs that are present in a vb are identical between genomes. applying these thresholds, 98% of the vb types in the descendants were present in the parents . figure 4b shows a comparison of vb types between shingi and its parents. the resulting information was used to analyze the reshuffling patterns of the parental genomes in the descendants .almost all of the descendant chromosomal regions were present in the corresponding parental lines. however, some of the remaining regions, such as an <dig> -mb block in chromosome <dig> of shingi , were not observed similarly in the parental genomes, likely because the two individual parental plants that were used in this analysis are not the direct ancestors of the descendant cultivars. robustness of vb detection with respect to sequencing depth we evaluated the performance of the vb detection at various sequencing depths and found that the vb method remained accurate even with 5-fold depths of mapping data . the performance of the vb method depends on that of the snv calling, which, in turn, depends on the sequencing read depths. in our analysis, the sensitivity of the homologous snv detection decreased dramatically at depths of <10-fold, amounting to 79% at a 6-fold depth and 73% at a 5-fold depth . nevertheless, even with the deterioration of the snv-calling sensitivity, the sensitivity of the vb method remained greater than 90%, even at a 6-fold depth. at an 8-fold depth, the sensitivity and precision of vb detection reached approximately 95% of the highest values. therefore, the vb method is very robust with respect to sequencing depths. vb-based analysis of publicly available soybean and rice genomes to assess its general applicability, we applied the vb method to two sets of publicly available genomes of <dig> soybean lines and <dig> rice accessions <cit> . the <dig> publicly available soybean genomes consisted of <dig> cultivated and <dig> wild soybeans <cit> . all of them were chinese except for three cultivars from brazil, taiwan, and the usa. nevertheless, for simplicity, all the <dig> soybean types will be referred to collectively as “chinese soybeans”. on average, the sequencing depth was 5-fold, which should thus allow for the attainment of at least 89% sensitivity and 88% precision according to depth-performance calibration . the vb method was successfully employed to analyze all but one cultivar genome that had distinctly fewer snvs than did the others. as in the five korean soybean cultivars, each of the <dig> chinese cultivar genomes also contained snvs that were clustered in certain chromosomal regions with distinct snv density profiles . there were a total of <dig> recombination sites, which was <dig> -fold higher than those that were observed in the five korean soybean genomes, likely due to the higher number of analyzed genomes. more than half of the recombination sites in the five korean soybean genomes coincided with those in the <dig> chinese cultivar genomes. the remaining 38% may reflect differences in the genetic pools between the chinese and korean soybeans. the <dig> wild soybeans had much fewer svbs than did the cultivated soybeans. an average of 31% of the genomic regions of the wild soybeans contained svbs, and there were a total of <dig> recombination sites, 43% of which coincided with those of the <dig> cultivars. these observations suggest that the <dig> wild soybeans might have had opportunities to outcross with the ancestors of the cultivated soybeans. to assess the value of the wild soybean genomes as genetic resources, we determined the number of vbs that are shared between the cultivated and wild soybean genomes. many vbs from the cultivar genomes were present in at least one of the wild soybean genomes. by contrast, far fewer vbs from the wild soybean genomes were present in the cultivar genomes , suggesting that wild soybeans have a much more diverse genetic pool than do the cultivars. we next demonstrated that the vb method can be applied to monocot crops, such as rice. the procedures that were used in the soybean genome analysis were directly applied to rice genomes . we selected a total of <dig> oryza sativa spp. japonica genomes from <dig> rice accessions that were reported in a previous study <cit> . the following three varieties were included: seven temperate japonica , ten tropical japonica , and six aromatic varieties. the average mapping depth of the sequencing data was approximately 14-fold, which is sufficient for accurate vb-based analysis . a total of <dig> recombination sites were found in the rice genomes. only <dig> % of the sites were present in all three groups . the seven temperate and ten tropical japonica genomes shared more than twice as many recombination sites as those that were shared with the six aromatic genomes. the resulting vb patterns indicated that the three groups are characterized by visually distinct snv density profiles . the six aromatic varieties had the most distinct patterns. these findings are consistent with the conclusions of the original report, which were based on sequence homology <cit> . 3b. quantification of genome diversity of crop population in terms of vbs vbs were used to quantitatively estimate the genome diversities of crop populations. whereas a sequence-based comparison infers the homology of genomes that have diverged via natural evolution , a block-based comparison determines whether two blocks from two genomes originated from the same parental genome . we examined the genome diversity by calculating the “vb diversity score”, which is defined as the number of unique vb types per the number of all vb sites in a genome. the steps for the calculation of the vb diversity score are illustrated in additional file 10: figure s7a–c. the resulting graphs revealed differences in diversity among the four groups of crops . the <dig> chinese soybean cultivar genomes produced the most smoothly increasing curve of vb diversity scores that eventually leveled off, indicating limited genome diversity in the cultivars. in comparison, wild soybeans produced a steeply increasing irregular curve that did not level off, indicating diverse vb compositions. the genetic diversity of the five korean soybeans can also be seen . the two parental genomes had a score of <dig> , which was similar to the score of the first two genomes in the other soybean groups. the three subgroups of rice genomes showed distinguishable patterns representing subgroups of unique recombination sites . the curve for temperate japonica was the most irregular among the three subgroups. the vb diversity scores of the rice genomes were much lower than those of the <dig> cultivated soybean genomes. vbs as recombination blocks experimental validation supported that vbs are genuine recombination blocks. we determined the recombination frequencies in the <dig> – <dig> mb region of chromosome <dig> in 614 f <dig> progenies of rils, which were the progenies of the cross that was made between hwangkeum and daepoong . in this <dig> -mb region, hwangkeum had three dvbs that were 140 kb, 300 kb, and 190 kb in length alternating with three svbs, whereas daepoong had only one long svb. the three svb regions were of identical types between daepoong and hwangkeum.the analysis of the recombination frequencies in the <dig> rils showed that at least <dig> times more recombination events occurred in the svbs than in the dvbs. a total of nine and <dig> recombination events occurred in 630 kb of dvbs and <dig> kb of svbs, respectively. this indicates that the more similar two sequences are, the more frequently recombination events occur. this relationship is consistent with a previous study that reported reduced recombination rates in regions surrounding non-alignable flanking sequences, such as snvs and indels <cit> . the genetic linkage distances and vb lengths were also compared. vb-specific indel markers were used to determine the recombination status of chromosomes <dig> and <dig> for the f <dig> rils that are described above. genetic and physical maps were constructed using markers that could distinguish between the dvb types of two cultivars, as described in the methods section. we found very large vbs within very short genetic distances. five vbs that were larger than 2 mb were located within <dig> cm of chromosome <dig> , and two large vbs of 12 mb and <dig> mb were found within <dig> cm of chromosome <dig> . these results indicate that vbs are recombination units that rarely split. identification of the locus determining soybean hilum color finally, we showed the practicability of the vb method for map-based screening by identifying a putative locus that determines soybean hilum color. although hilum color is thought to be related to the i locus on chromosome 8 <cit> , the exact locus has not yet been identified. using the vb method, we attempted to detect the hilum color-determining locus. as a result, the entire screening process for narrowing down the target region required only the following three steps in the 614 f <dig> progenies of rils that were selected from the cross of hwangkeum and daepoong . we began by selecting <dig> indel markers that were longer than four base pairs, which allowed for the discrimination of the vbs from hwangkeum from those from daepoong . among these indel markers, the first screening was performed with <dig> markers in all <dig> chromosomes, each of which represented a single vb that was identified from the hwangkeum and daepoong genomes. the hk <dig> marker on chromosome <dig> had the highest correlation with the hilum color phenotype . the second step was performed with five markers that represented one of the five dvbs near hk <dig> because recombination events within the dvbs occurred rarely, as described in the previous section, one marker was sufficient to represent one dvb. we found that the target locus was in a 300-kb dvb spanning the <dig> – <dig> mb region , which showed the highest correlation with the hilum color phenotype. the final step was performed with seven markers to locate the exact hilum color-determining locus, which was located in a very large block of approximately 197 kb. to identify the locus that determines hilum color, a comparative analysis was conducted. soybean seed coats and hilum color are regulated by chalcone synthase genes that control the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin pigments via a posttranscriptional mode of gene silencing <cit> . therefore, we compared the sequence differences for daepoong and hwangkeum of chss in the i locus, which is located close to the hd <dig> marker in the 197-kb block. there were no significant sequence differences except for one non-synonymous snv in chs <dig> of the i locus , which cannot affect the regulation of gene silencing mechanisms between two sequences in this region. instead, we found that two highly similar genes, chs <dig> and chs <dig> were present as inverted repeats near the hd <dig> marker downstream of the i locus . except for these chss, there were no genes that are involved in the anthocyanin metabolic pathway in this 197-kb block. we concluded that an inverted repeat structure of chs <dig> and chs <dig> is a candidate locus for hilum color determination. we compared the sequence differences among the six soybean cultivars in the 197-kb block and found that the only notable difference was a 5-bp deletion in the chs <dig> promoter regions of every genome except for hwangkeum . if the expression of chs <dig> and chs <dig> is regulated by a gene silencing mechanism that is similar to that of the ii allele on the i locus, then these two genes may be silenced in hwangkeum, which has an intact chs <dig> promoter. however, if the 5-bp deletion inhibits promoter activity, chs <dig> would not be silenced due to the absence of interfering rna. therefore, the 5-bp deletion may produce dark-colored hila in all of the soybeans except for hwangkeum. we also examined <dig> other soybean cultivars and found that the 5-bp deletion perfectly correlated with colored hila . we named this putative locus hc, in which the ih and ih alleles control the yellow and brown hilum colors, respectively. these results suggest that the seed color phenotype of hwangkeum is determined by two linked loci, consisting of the ii allele of the i locus and the ih allele of the hc locus. discussion we proposed an efficient recombination block detection method that is based on genomic variation patterns. this method provides key information for the map-based screening of bred cultivars. the vb method can be applied to various crop species that have available reference genomes. in this study, representative monocot and dicot model crops, rice and soybeans, were successfully analyzed using the vb method. the vb-based comparative genomics method has several advantages over other methods. the first advantage is that the samples can be compared directly at the block level. therefore, an agricultural trait-associated locus or gene can be identified with reduced screening efforts by using a small number of markers that represent the vbs. we demonstrated this advantage by identifying a putative locus determining hilum color in soybeans. there is no need to use markers on the vbs of the same type that are present in two genomes, such as the rear half of gm <dig> the middle of gm <dig> and the front half of gm <dig> in the 1st pass . the vbs were also useful in the 2nd pass of the screening. since vbs are the units that rarely split by recombination, only one marker can represent one dvb. in this report, only five markers were used to screen five dvbs in the 2 mb target region . these results indicate that the vb method enables the minimal use of molecular markers and efficient screening via an accurate recombination map. map-based cloning in soybeans has thus far identified few genes <cit> , and this method represents a significant advancement. the second advantage is that the vb method does not depend on the number of samples. in contrast to other statistical methods, such as the ld analysis, the vb method can identify recombination blocks using only one genome if a reference genome sequence is available. this feature is especially useful in genomic screening against ril populations. even with the availability of only two parental genome sequences, researchers can still define the vb blocks, compare the two genomes at the recombination block level, and predict the possible recombination sites that are likely to occur in the ril population. the third advantage is that the vb method can accurately detect recombination blocks even with low-depth sequencing data. the vb method detected recombination blocks with more than 90% sensitivity and precision even with 6-fold depth data.there were many chromosomal regions that have the same types of vbs across multiple genomes, reflecting the limited genetic diversity resulting from artificial selection during the breeding history. as shown in figure 8a, the identical regions showed <dig> times higher recombination rates than those of the other regions. in contrast, recombination occurs randomly in wild-type genomes, which rarely share identical regions with each other. these results imply that low genetic diversity can lead to non-random recombination, followed by the conservation of vbs. CONCLUSIONS in conclusion, we propose the vb method for the identification and comparison of the reshuffled genome sequences of bred cultivars. we demonstrated the usefulness and generality of the vb method by applying it to the publicly available genomes of <dig> soybeans and <dig> rice accessions. the vb-representing indel markers accurately identified a putative locus that determines the yellow hilum color in soybean. thus, the vb method is applicable in the cloning of agronomically important genes in a simple and fast manner.",

    "prompt": "Create a plain-language summary of this clinical abstract. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND although the availability of complete genome sequences and the wealth of large-scale biological data sets opened up unprecedented opportunities to elucidate the genetic basis of rare and common human diseases <cit> , comprehending the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms continues to be challenging. majority of the common diseases are genetically intricate, polygenic and multifactorial, and frequently manifest as different clinical phenotypes. additionally, these complex conditions are often triggered by an interaction of genetic, environmental, and physiological factors, making it difficult for researchers to narrow their focus to a single or few genes. high-throughput genome-wide studies like linkage analysis and gene expression profiling although useful for classification and characterization do not provide sufficient information to identify specific disease causal genes. both of these approaches typically result in hundreds of potential candidate genes, failing to help the researchers in reducing the target genes to a manageable number for further validation. functional enrichment approaches <cit> focusing on gene sets that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation although successful in identifying enriched biological themes are not suitable for gene prioritization. to overcome this, several gene prioritization methods have been developed <cit> . pocus <cit> , for instance, finds candidate genes by identifying an enrichment of keywords associated with gene ontology , shared protein domains and expression profiles among a given set of susceptibility loci relative to the genome at large. similarly, prospectr <cit> and suspects <cit> , focusing on mendelian and oligogenic disorders, compare go, protein domains and expression libraries of putative disease genes with those known to be involved with the same disease. integrating genomic and proteomic data, mootha et al <cit> identified lsfc causal gene. the recent method, endeavour <cit> , uses several data sources to prioritize candidate genes. none of these approaches however utilize the mouse phenotype data in their prioritization approaches although mouse is the key model organism for the analysis of mammalian developmental, physiological and disease processes <cit> . additionally, there have been several reports <cit> wherein a direct comparison of human and mouse phenotypes allowed for the rapid recognition of disease causal genes. extending on the above mentioned approaches, and an earlier hypothesis, that the majority of disease causal genes are functionally closely related <cit> , we reasoned that an integrative genomics-transcriptomics-phenomics-bibliomics approach utilizing the available human gene annotations, mouse phenotype data and literature co-citations of genes will expedite human complex disease candidate gene identification and prioritization. we call our prioritization method toppgene . for the first time, we incorporated the mouse phenotype data as one of the feature parameters apart from go, pathways, biomedical literature, protein domains, protein interactions and gene expression of genes to prioritize human disease candidate genes and demonstrate its utility. RESULTS mouse phenotype as a feature for candidate gene prioritization the mammalian phenotype ontology enables robust annotation of mammalian phenotypes in the context of mutations, quantitative trait loci and strains that are used as models of human biology and disease. the mp ontology supports different levels and richness of phenotypic knowledge and flexible annotations to individual genotypes <cit> . each node in mpo represents a category of phenotypes and each mp ontology term has a unique identifier, a definition, synonyms, and is associated with gene variants causing these phenotypes in genetically engineered or mutagenesis experiments. in the current study, we retrieved mouse genes associated with each of the mp term and extracted the corresponding human orthologous genes. in the current version of mpo, there are <dig> terms associated to <dig> unique entrez mouse genes . we do not check whether the human orthologous gene of a mouse gene causes similar phenotype. rather, we assume that orthologous genes cause \"orthologous\" phenotype and test the potential of the extrapolated mouse phenotype terms as a similarity measure between the training and test group of genes in candidate gene analysis. document identifier as a feature for candidate gene prioritization we use biomedical literature abstract identifiers as a feature for classification, where the dimensionality of the feature space was equal to the number of documents in the document set. we hypothesized that if a pmid is cross-referenced in two genes, the two genes are likely to have a direct or indirect association. a large number of co-citations for a pair of genes probably represents a relationship between the two genes. for each gene, toppgene considers all associated articles as literature annotation of this gene. the gene to pmid association file was downloaded from ncbi entrez gene ftp site <cit> . <dig> pmids were associated with more than one gene and <dig> genes had at least one pmid association. <dig> genes shared at least one pmid with another gene. for the current study, we do not look into the details of the relationship type between the genes but consider only co-citation. in other words, the pmids are used only as a feature of similarity measure in the candidate gene analysis. comparison of toppgene with other gene prioritization approaches to evaluate the performance of our approach and also compare it with other similar gene prioritization approaches <cit> , we performed two types of comparisons: large-scale cross-validations and small-scale test cases . for large-scale cross-validations, we used the same or similar training sets as mentioned in the previous methods. specifically we compared toppgene's performance with endeavour <cit> using random-gene cross-validation; and for comparison with prospectr <cit> and suspects <cit> , we used locus-region cross-validation. additionally, as test cases, we selected two diseases, congenital heart defects and diabetic retinopathy , and compared the prioritization performance of toppgene with suspects <cit> and endeavour <cit> . gene length protein interactions protein interactions comparison of toppgene with endeavour: random-gene cross-validation in the current study we used our own disease training sets because the complete data sets used by endeavour are not available for public access. we, therefore, randomly selected <dig> diseases along with their associated genes from online mendelian inheritance in man and the genetic association database . each disease gene set contained <dig> to <dig> genes. the total number of genes across <dig> selected diseases was <dig> . for negative controls, <dig> sets, each containing <dig> random genes, were created as training data. we followed the same methodology as endeavour to evaluate the performance of our prioritization method and also compare the results with endeavour. in each validation run, the gene group of a particular disease was used as the training set. the \"target\" gene was then mixed with <dig> random genes to make a test set of <dig> genes. the rank of the \"target\" gene in the resulting list, following prioritization, was recorded. this process was repeated for each gene in the list. sensitivity was defined as the frequency of \"target\" genes that are ranked above a particular threshold position, and specificity as the percentage of genes ranked below the threshold. for instance, a sensitivity/specificity value of 70/ <dig> indicates that the correct disease gene is ranked among the best-scoring 10% of genes in 70% of the prioritizations. receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted based on the sensitivity/specificity values and area under curve was computed as the standard measure of the performance of the method. endeavour reported 90/ <dig> sensitivity/specificity value and an auc score of <dig> <cit> . using toppgene, we first created the overall roc curves. in order to compare with endeavour directly, we followed the same definitions for sensitivity and specificity as described by aerts et al <cit> . figure <dig> shows the overall roc curves using toppgene. the auc score of the <dig> disease training sets was <dig> , and the sensitivity/specificity was 90/ <dig> i.e. the \"target\" gene was ranked among the top 23% in 90% of the cases. in case of the control, the auc score of the <dig> random training sets was <dig> . second, we studied the roc curves based on p-value based scores. endeavour provides ranking of the \"target\" gene based on p-values from order statistics, which are local p-values. in contrast, toppgene provides p-values based on random sampling of the whole genome. toppgene p-value based scores are therefore global measures of the similarity of the test genes to the training genes. as a result, sensitivity and specificity can also be defined based on the p-value based scores; specifically, sensitivity is the true positive rate at a cutoff score, and specificity is the true negative rate at the same cut-off level. for example, a sensitivity/specificity of 70/ <dig> indicates that 70% of the \"target\" genes and 10% of the \"non-target\" genes have scores higher than a particular cut-off value. evaluation of features used for gene prioritization in toppgene to study the efficiency of different features , roc curve of each of the feature sets was generated. figure <dig> shows the corresponding auc scores of the roc curves, depicting the relative performance of each feature set in the prioritization method. the mouse phenotype and pubmed showed the best performance while protein interactions and gene expression features performed poorly. in terms of coverage , pubmed was the best while mp had least coverage . to understand better the relative performance and the power of each of the features in gene prioritization, we tested toppgene by performing cross-validations with one of the features left out. the performance decreased significantly only when mp was removed . as expected, the best performance was recorded when all the features were considered for prioritization, with an auc of <dig> and a coverage of ~89%. for a cutoff score of <dig> , the sensitivity/specificity was 74/ <dig> in other words, 74% of the \"target\" genes were included in the candidate list . comparison of toppgene with suspects and prospectr: locus-region cross-validation in this cross-validation we compared the performance of toppgene with two other gene prioritization methods, namely, suspects <cit> and prospectr <cit> . we used the same data set <cit> that was used in suspects and prospectr study . this data set contains a list of <dig> omim diseases . for each cross-validation run, the training set was composed of all the genes related to a disease except the \"target\" gene. the test set was created by including all the genes in the <dig> mb locus region i.e. genes occurring in the <dig> mb flanking regions of the \"target\" gene's chromosomal location along with the \"target\" gene itself. prospectr, which uses sequence features alone for gene prioritization, ranked the \"target\" gene in an average of top <dig> % in the prioritized test lists and among the top 5% about <dig> times out of <dig> . on the other hand, suspects, which uses go, protein domains, gene expression, and sequence features for gene prioritization, ranked the \"target\" genes in the top 5% of the prioritized lists <dig> times out of <dig> , and on average the \"target\" genes were ranked at top <dig> % in the prioritization results. in comparison, toppgene was able to rank the \"target\" gene among the top 5% of the prioritized lists for <dig> times out of <dig> . five genes in the original list were not present in the current ncbi entrez gene database and were therefore excluded. thus, instead of <dig> genes, <dig> genes were used for this cross-validation test. on average, the \"target\" genes were ranked at top <dig> % in the prioritized lists using our approach . to evaluate the performance of the individual feature, we repeated the same locus-region cross-validation with one feature removed at a time . the performance did not change significantly if only go, pathway, protein domains, protein interactions or gene expression features were excluded during gene prioritization. the performance however declined significantly when mp or pubmed was not included as one of the features in gene prioritization . comparison of toppgene with endeavour and suspects test case 1: congenital heart disease we used <dig> genes implicated in congenital heart disease as the test case and prioritized the genes using the random-gene cross-validation method as described in the earlier sections. in each run, same training and test sets were submitted to suspects, endeavour and toppgene manually. twenty-eight prioritizations were performed by each of the three methods and the average size of the test sets was <dig> genes. following the prioritization, the \"target\" genes were ranked among the top 5% in the resulting lists <dig> <dig> and <dig> times out of <dig> , and in the top 10% <dig> <dig> and <dig> times with suspects, endeavour and toppgene respectively. the average rank ratios of the \"target\" genes were <dig> %, <dig> % and <dig> % for suspects, endeavour and our approach respectively . test case 2: diabetic retinopathy a similar comparative analysis was repeated with diabetic retinopathy as a test case using locus-region cross-validation as described in previous section. the training set comprised <dig> known genes implicated in dr while the test sets comprised genes in the locus regions of the \"target\" genes. the \"target\" genes were ranked among top 5% in the resulting lists <dig> times out of <dig> with both suspects and endeavour based gene prioritization. as witnessed in earlier comparisons, toppgene again outperformed both suspects and endeavour by ranking the \"target\" genes among top 5% in <dig> times out of <dig> . if we considered the top 10%, surprisingly suspects fared better than endeavour and was close to toppgene's performance. thus, the \"target\" genes were ranked among the top 10% of the prioritized gene lists <dig> <dig> and <dig> times respectively with suspects, endeavour and toppgene. the average rank ratios of the \"target\" genes were <dig> %, <dig> % and <dig> % for suspects, endeavour and our approach respectively . toppgene implementation and access the programs of our prioritization method are implemented purely in java. open source java package ftpbean by calvin tai <cit> is used to automatically download data and annotation files from ftp servers. biojava packages <cit> are used to process uniprot records <cit> and extract related protein domain information. golem <cit> source code was adapted and modified for dealing with ontology annotations. colt <cit> and jakarta commons-math libraries <cit> are used for statistical analysis. the fuzzy similarity measure and related functions are implemented locally. our prioritization method is available as a standalone web application <cit> . the user interface is written in java script, jsp and servlets, and integrated with the tomcat web server. users can enter the training and test sets of genes of interest as queries from the interface, and the application will display enriched themes in the training set genes along with annotated prioritized test genes. all the gene information and annotation data will be updated automatically except for pathways. discussion traditionally there are two categories of approaches to compute the similarity between any two genes based on semantic annotations: pair-based and set-based <cit> . in pair-based methods, an average or maximum of pairwise term information content is calculated as the similarity between the two genes. this will however cause inconsistency problems. specifically, an average of pairwise term information content tends to underestimate the similarities while a maximum of pairwise term information content tends to overestimate the similarity . on the other hand, set-based similarity measures, such as jaccard and dice similarity <cit> , will generate <dig> if the two genes do not share a common annotation term. this behavior is especially undesirable for annotation terms from ontologies. the fuzzy-based similarity measure adopted and applied in our approach can overcome these problems and therefore could generate a better similarity measure than the traditional methods. most of the current tools to enrich lists of genes or candidate gene prioritization are based on go, gene expression or pathways <cit> . previous studies have also shown that integrating multiple lines of evidence is good for candidate gene analysis. however, to the best of our knowledge none of the previous candidate gene prioritization approaches used mouse phenotype features although the mouse is a key model organism for the analysis of mammalian developmental, physiological, and disease processes <cit> . additionally, there have been reports wherein a direct comparison of human and mouse phenotypes allowed for the rapid recognition of disease causal genes . in this paper, for the first time, we use phenotype annotations for mouse orthologs of human genes as one line of evidence for candidate gene analysis. we are aware that comparing phenotypes between two different organisms may involve consideration of several issues. for instance, the mouse genotype may involve mutations to orthologs of one or more of the genes associated with a phenotype, but the mouse phenotype may not resemble the disease in human. nevertheless, finding, for instance that targeted disruption of the mouse ortholog of human cfc <dig> gene results in l-r laterality defects including cardiac malformations <cit> can lead to novel and interesting hypotheses. although, our results have conclusively demonstrated the utility of mouse phenotype data in human candidate gene analysis, there are some inherent limitations in using mouse phenotype annotations. for instance, mp is not a disease-centric ontology and the phenotype of a same gene mutation can vary depending on specific mouse strains or their genetic backgrounds. most importantly, orthologous genes need not necessarily result in orthologous phenotypes. we are currently working on a more efficient cross-species phenome extrapolation where in the mouse phenotype terms are mapped to human phenotype concepts semantically and the resultant orthologous genes associated with an orthologous phenotype are identified. how to efficiently utilize this kind of information in human disease candidate gene prioritization is a topic of future research. apart from the contribution of mp, improved performance of toppgene over other methods can be attributed partially to the usage of more comprehensive data resources. for instance, unlike endeavour, the pathway data set in toppgene is not limited to kegg resource. we compiled more than <dig> additional pathways from various sources and used for gene prioritization. our approach however has some limitations. first, by using a training set we assume that the disease genes we have yet to discover will be consistent with what is already known about a disease and/or its genetic basis which may not always be the case. second, it is important to note that the annotations and analyses provided and the prioritization by our approach can only be as accurate as the underlying online sources from which the annotations are retrieved. only one-fifth of the known human genes have pathway or phenotype annotations and there are still more than 40% genes whose functions are not defined . third, using an appropriate training set – although the difference was not significant, while cross-validating, we noted that using larger training sets would decrease the sensitivity and specificity of the prioritization when compared to using smaller training sets . CONCLUSIONS existing disease candidate gene prioritization methodologies mine biological and functional information about candidate genes, and we believe that our system, toppgene, can complement these existing approaches by using a novel method that mines mouse phenotype data. the aim of toppgene is to generate likely candidates by extensive analysis of all known characteristics of genes, and is inevitably restricted by existing information be it go annotation, pathways, phenotype or gene expression data. through various examples, we demonstrate that toppgene performs better than suspects, prosepctr and endeavour in candidate gene prioritization. however, it needs to be emphasized that our aim is not to prove that toppgene prioritized genes are true disease genes but to aid in selection of a subset of most likely disease gene candidates from larger sets of disease-implicated genes identified by high throughput genome-wide techniques like linkage analysis and microarray analysis. for the first time, we have used the mouse phenotype data in human disease candidate gene analysis. our results demonstrate that employing the mouse phenotype data improves candidate gene prioritization significantly and can therefore aid in the process of focusing the search for the most likely human disease gene candidates. lastly, as the functional annotations of human and mouse genes improve, especially the mouse phenotype annotations, we envisage a proportional increase in the performance of toppgene and strongly believe that it will be a valuable adjunct to wet lab experiments in human genetics and disease research.",

performing important biological activities. the action of an entity can mediate or interfere with the action of other entities developing a complex network of interactions. frequently entities perform more than one activity in the system, some which are known and integrate the current knowledge in life sciences. other activities are not so well documented or remain unknown for long periods of time and are generally discovered by chance. drugs, for instance, have a primary pharmacological activity and secondary activities responsible for side effects. however, drug side effects can be explored as new uses for the treatment of different diseases. a remarkable example is the impotence drug sildenafil citrate that was originally designed for the treatment of angina and hypertension. viagra® clinical trials revealed, nevertheless, the drug ability of increasing erectile function as its side effect <cit> . on the other hand, research achievements in the post genomic age have promoted an enormous and continuous increasing on biological knowledge. these achievements often describe biological entity activities and have been published around the world aiming to assist, increase and speed up the number of discoveries in life sciences. a similar process has occurred since the inception of the world wide web and the rise of digital libraries. web pages have been continuously and rapidly published given rise to a enormous amount of interlinked information. this allowed the conduction of many studies about methods for extracting and analysing the information published in this ocean of information. in many of these studies the vector space model <cit> has been recognized as an important tool to extract the most relevant information in a given context. in this work we have developed an inference model based on the vsm in order to predict new interactions between biological entities of distinct categories such as ecosystems, organisms, organs, tissues, cells, organelles, genes, proteins, diseases and drugs. our model constructs a network of known entity interactions from a textual collection. the documents in this collection describe the current knowledge in life sciences. known entity interactions represent entity co-occurrences in at least one document of the textual collection. after finding all known interactions, our model traverses and analyzes the network predicting new entity interactions. our objective is to use the known interactions to infer new ones and to rank all found interactions. the ranking of interactions allows researchers to focus in the most promising activities, thus promoting further advances in life sciences. the prediction of new interactions is performed using the vsm along with a transitive closure similar to that used in literature-based discovery <cit> . the transitive closure relies on the fact that “if an entity x interacts with entities y and w and another entity z also interacts with entity y, then z probably also interacts with entity w”. different from previous work, in our model we adapt this transitive closure in order to exploit the primary and secondary activities performed by entities of distinct biological categories. in the context of our model, x and z are entities of the same biological category, y and w are also entities of the same biological category. however, the category of entities x and z is different of that of entities y and w. we have implemented a system called biosearch <cit> as a proof of concept of our model. the system deals with <dig> types of distinct entities: diseases, drugs, genes, and targets. the textual collection used in the system encompasses a sample of <dig> patent claims gathered from the united state patent and trade mark office <cit> . we have used the patent claim because it is an important section in patent specifications, presenting the invention and defining the scope of patent protection <cit> . from <dig> possible interactions between entities in our network, the system has found <dig> known interactions in the patent claim collection and has inferred <dig> new interactions. thus, based on our model, the system has constructed a network with <dig> interactions that can be further analyzed in order to promote new advances in science and technology. to validate our results we have conducted an experiment over the patent issue dates. we have reconstructed the interaction network in a range of <dig> years. we have observed that new interactions found in a given past year were confirmed by patents issued in a more recent date. for instance, we have <dig> patent claim issued in <dig> specifying the interaction between the disease heart attack and the gene ppar-gama. when we removed this patent claim from the textual collection, <dig> patent claims indicated this interaction as a possible new interaction in <dig> we have also found scientific papers that confirm some of the new inferred interactions. for instance, the best result found in our model specifies a new interaction between the adrenaline neurotransmitter and the androgen receptor gene in the 2-dimensional subnetwork gene × target. no patent claim in our collection indicates this interaction. however, sastry et al. <cit> reported in <dig> that the antiapoptotic effect of adrenaline partially depends on androgen receptor. related work in this work, our objective is to present a model that employs the vsm in order to identify biological entity activities from a textual collection. in our approach, known entity activities represent entity co-occurrences in the textual collection. on the other hand, new activies are predicted from the known ones. jenssen et al. <cit> show that co-occurrence reflects biologically meaningful relationships, thus providing an approach to extract and structure known biological knowledge. accordingly, we have developed a strategy based on the vsm that constructs a network of biological entity interactions from the life science literature and ranks these interactions. our strategy combines the vsm ability to extract knowledge from text along with some underlining principles of literature-based discovery <cit> . don r. swanson has pioneered the work in the field of literature-based discovery using the syllogism x → y and y → z then x → z in order to discover new biological entity activities <cit> . in this syllogism x → y and y → z are known interactions stated in the literature. on the other hand, x → z is a new interaction not explicitly found in the literature and inferred from previously known interactions. afterwards, smalheiser et al. <cit> have implemented this syllogistic construction in a software called arrowsmith. in addition, weeber et al. <cit> have contributed to literature-based discovery introducing a model based on natural language processing techniques in order to find concepts in the biomedical literature and reduce the search space. none of these techniques associates weights with these biological interactions in order to rank them. as mentioned, a challenge we face when dealing with literature-based discovery is how to rank a large number of inferred interactions in a way that can facilitate new discoveries by prioritizing the ones with the largest potential. in order to tackle this challenge, swanson et al. <cit> have proposed and tested strategies to rank and filter the output of the arrowsmith system. hristovski et al. <cit> presented a method for literature-based discovery based on association rules and implemented it in a system called bitola. moreover, wren et al. <cit> have considered the construction of networks from the biomedical literature describing a method based in the syllogism proposed by swanson. they have defined areas of research interest such as genes and diseases, and model and rank the interactions using the fuzzy set theory. the ranking strategies used in these works consider that entities co-occurring frequently in a textual collection are more likely to represent biologically meaningful relationships <cit> . therefore, these strategies promote new interactions which are predicted from a large number of indications. however, in literature-based discovery there are many distinct scenarios and in some situations a great number of indications may not reveal the most relevant new interactions. for instance, many indications may lead to a set of new interactions that were already studied but were not published because they are not feasible or they are unwanted in practice. on the other hand, there exist situations in which new interactions predicted from a few number of indications are in fact the ones with the best potential. in this sense, ranking strategies for new interactions predicted from few indications are an important tool for literature-based discovery because they help in the identification of relevant interactions not easily observed and extracted from textual collections. in this scenario the vsm provides a great aid to the literature-based discovery. the tfidf weighting strategy exploited in the vsm promotes interactions with many occurrences in few documents in the collection and penalizes interactions commonly occurring in many documents of the collection. consequently, the vsm fosters rare interactions over the trite ones. in literature-based discovery we must avoid the inference of interactions already stated in the literature. kostoff <cit> has discussed this problem and issues related to the quantity and quality of interactions. kostoff et al. <cit> have presented a generic methodology for literature-based discovery and have used this methodology to identify interactions concerning raynaud’s phenomenon <cit> , cataracts <cit> , parkinson’s disease <cit> , multiple sclerosis <cit> and water purification <cit> . kostoff et al. <cit> have also compiled the lessons learned in these experiments and presented guidelines for further research. however, in this series of works the authors have not used any numerical filter to rank the new interactions found. we have also to cope with the coverage problem when looking for biological entity activities by searching several information sources such as experimental data <cit> , drug labels <cit> , scientific papers <cit> and patents. patents are very important instruments of knowledge transfer and researchers commonly resort to this literature because its great value as a source of strategic, technical and business-related information <cit> . trippe <cit> , for example, described patinformatics as the science of analyzing patent information to discover relationships and trends. mukherjea et al. <cit> developed a system to retrieve information from biomedical patents. larkey <cit> described the patent retrieval and classification system developed for the uspto. fall et al. <cit> evaluated the best ways to deal with patent classification and presented a comparison of the classification effectiveness of several algorithms in this task. tseng et al. <cit> described and evaluated several text mining techniques to create patent maps and improve patent analysis tasks such as classification and knowledge sharing. particularly, the claim section is considered the most important section in patent specifications <cit> . thus, shinmori et al. <cit> proposed a framework to represent the structure of the patent claim section and a method to automatically analyze it. accordingly, here we also explore patents, more specifically, the patent claim section, along with our proposed model in order to discover new biological entity interactions of potential interest. main contribution we have created a model to construct networks of entity interactions from the biological literature with the objective of finding known and new entity activities in a biological system. in our model we have used vsm to identify already known entity interactions. in addition, we have extended the vsm with a transitive inference process capable of predicting new entity interactions. the networks are formed by subnetworks of interactions between entities of distinct categories. the advantage of using categories is the ability to restrict the research space for interactions between entities of specific categories and promote more accurate results. interactions are initially established in a network by entity co-occurrences in a textual collection. these interactions represent known interactions already described in the literature. the known interactions receive a weight corresponding the interaction level between entities based on the similarity value derived from the application of the vsm. the advantage of using the vsm is to explore its well documented algebraic framework for information retrieval from textual collections in order to find the entity co-occurrences and also measure their interaction levels. the vsm contributes for literature-based discovery by helping to predict the best new potential interactions not easily extracted from textual collections. the vsm also helps in situations in which entities rarely co-occurring in a document set are the ones with the potential best contributions for a researcher. our model uses the interactions established in the network to predict new interactions based on the transitive closure that we have employed in the inference process. the transitive closure states that “if an entity x interacts with entities y and w and an entity z interacts with entity y then z may also interact with w”. differently from previous work, entities satisfying the transitive closure must always follow a constraint. the constraint imposes that x and z are entities of the same biological category c <dig> y and w are entities of another category c <dig> and that c <dig> and c <dig> are distinct categories . this constraint gives rise to the subnetworks that form the network of interactions. the main advantage of using this constraint is to narrow the research space of entity interactions promoting more accurate results. new interactions also receive a value for their interaction levels, based on the interaction levels of the interactions satisfying the transitive closure, as will be detailed later. this makes it possible to rank all entity activities in the network. the main advantage of ranking the network interactions is to reduce the human effort spent in their analysis, by focusing in the ones with the largest potential. we have implemented the model in a system called biosearch which uses a textual collection formed by patent claims. in our system, users can search all interactions established in the network . searching known entity interactions, users have a representation of the prior knowledge in a given subject that can be extracted from patent literature. these interactions are very important because they present a description of the current knowledge, avoiding patent infringements. on the other hand, users can search new interactions and have a representation of possible new technologies that may yet receive patent protection. in the present work our goal is not to ensure a comprehensive coverage of the biological literature. instead, we provide a proof of concept demostrating the applicability of our model in disclosing and ranking new entity interactions. for this, we have used a small textual collection to assess the model. many new interactions inferred by our model based on this collection may have already been reported in scientific papers, thus validating our results. network construction entities in a biological system interact with each other forming an interaction network. we can classify these entities into categories such as diseases, drugs, genes, and targets. in this work we have combined these categories in order to construct a network composed of n-dimensional subnetworks. we have extracted all entity interactions of a subnetwork from a textual collection using the vsm. given, for instance, the subnetwork with dimensional space drug × disease, consider that our model indicates we have documents reporting the use of drug m <dig> in the treatment of diseases d <dig> and d <dig> ). moreover, suppose the model also indicates we have documents which report the use of drug m <dig> in the treatment of disease d <dig> then, drugs m <dig> and m <dig> possibly share some common characteristic responsible for the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of both diseases d <dig> and d <dig> thus, the model infers a new connection in the subnetwork drug × disease linking drug m <dig> and disease d <dig> the new connection represents a new use of drug m <dig> then, in this example, m <dig> → d <dig> m <dig> → d <dig> and m <dig> → d <dig> are known interactions found in the literature. on the other hand, m <dig> → d <dig> is a new interaction inferred from the previous three known interactions. we have represented each subnetwork as a weighted graph whose weights measure the interaction level of the entities based on the textual collection. in this graph, nodes are entities of categories forming the subnetwork dimensional space, edges represent interactions between entities of distinct categories, and the interaction level is a value in the range <cit> . we determine the interaction level based on the vsm when we look for the entity co-occurrences throughout the textual collection. in a subnetwork with dimensional space drug × disease, for instance, suppose that drug m <dig> treats diseases d <dig> with interaction level a and d <dig> with interaction level b ). in addition, suppose drug m <dig> treats disease d <dig> with interaction level c. then, the model assigns an interaction level to the new connection linking drug m <dig> and disease d <dig> whose value is determined based on a, b e c. the graph in our model is represented by a matrix that receives biological entities of the subnetwork dimensions in its lines and columns ). we have defined that three interactions in the matrix are in transitive closure when they satisfy the condition and and → that means ”if entity x interacts with entities y and w and entity z interacts with entity y then z may also interact with w”. then, the model infers a new interaction in the matrix whenever it finds three interactions satisfying this transitive closure. all cells in the matrix initially receive the value <dig> indicating no entity interactions ). we use the entities of a cell in order to form a query. this query represents a conjunction of entities of distinct categories. the conjunction is important because it ensures that documents in which the entities occur are not orthogonal, i.e., they must have occurrences of all entities present in the query. then, we perform searches in the textual collection in order to find documents satisfying the query of each matrix cell ). the vsm assigns weight values for each query entity based on the tfidf strategy . we use these weights to measure the importance of the entity for a query of the matrix and also for a document of the textual collection. in the tfidf weight strategy wx,i is the weight of entity ex in a document di in the textual collection, tfx,i is the normalized frequency of entity ex in document di, idfx is the inverse document frequency of entity ex, fx,i is the frequency of entity ex in document di, maxj,i is the number of times the most frequent entity ej occurs in document di, n is the number of documents in the textual collection, and nx is the number of documents in the textual collection in which entity ex occurs. each query of the matrix receives a similarity value for each document in the textual collection based on the vsm . for the vsm similarity, qj is a query j of the matrix representing a conjunction of entities, t is the number of biological entities of the network, wx,i is the weight of entity ex in document di, wx,j is the weight of entity ex in query qj. in our model, the entity weights in a query are always <dig> . the similarity value stated in the vsm indicates the relevance of a document for a query. we use the similarities returned by equation <dig> to determine the interaction level of the query entities. the cell linking the query entities receives this interaction level which represents a known interaction in the subnetwork ). in our current experiments we determine the interaction level of a known interaction in <dig> different ways: the arithmetic average of the similarities, the maximum similarity found, and the sum of all the similarities. after all searches in the textual collection are concluded, we have established all known interactions of the network. however, some cells remain equal to <dig> indicating that some entity interactions are not explicitly mentioned in the collection ). these cells with value <dig> represent the potential new interactions between the biological entities they relate. the model infers a new interaction in the matrix whenever it finds three interactions satisfying the transitive closure and <dig> ). in our current experiments the interaction level of a new interaction is the arithmetic average of the interaction level of the three interactions satisfying the transitive closure. if many interactions satisfy the transitive closure, the model chooses the one with highest arithmetic average ). we have applied several iterations of our model on the matrix of a subnetwork in order to infer new interactions from interactions previously inferred. in iteration <dig> the model discovers all known interactions reported in the textual collection. in iteration <dig> the model discovers new interactions based on the known interactions. in iteration <dig> the model discovers new interactions based on interactions discovered in iterations <dig> and <dig> the model stops iterating when all cells of the matrix receives a value different from <dig> or when it is no more possible to find interactions satisfying the transitive closure. starting from iteration <dig> our model divides the interaction level of new interactions by the number of iterations performed. this penalty ensures that interactions found in earlier iterations have higher interaction levels. methods in our experiments, we have considered a sample of patent claims crawled from the uspto web site constituting a textual collection with <dig> documents. all these patents were issued between 01/01/ <dig> and 12/31/ <dig> besides, in the claim section of all these patents we are able to find at least one entity of the four biological categories considered in our crawling process, namely diseases, drugs, genes, and targets. in the uspto web site the query we have used to retrieve these patents is represented as aclm/”entity” and isd/1/1/ <dig> → 31/12/ <dig> where aclm specifies the patent claim section, entity is the biological entity name, and the isd specifies the patent issue date, respectively. the entity names are quoted in order to specify the phrase search mode. as mentioned, we have considered entities of <dig> biological system categories: diseases, drugs, genes, and targets . we have chosen these categories based on their importance for life sciences research and the practical applications of their entity interactions for the society. the category disease corresponds to a set of possible states of a biological system . the category drug corresponds to a set of molecules capable of changing the state of a biological system . the categories gene and target correspond to a set of building blocks of the biological system. the category gene is a set of building blocks responsible for generating other building blocks . the category target is a set of building blocks generated by genes and over which a drug acts . mayo clinic <cit> , therapeutic target database <cit> , drug bank <cit> , patient.uk <cit> , therapeutic target database, hugo gene nomenclature committee <cit> , therapeutic target database, in order to detect the entity occurrences throughout the collection, we have used exact string matching over the entity names and we have also considered entity related names such as synonyms. for instance, we have considered diabetes mellitus type <dig> and type <dig> diabetes as the same biological entity of category disease. we have formed clusters of related names for each entity . a representative single name in each cluster is used to represent the whole cluster during the network construction. some syntactic variation in entity names are also considered in each cluster . in our experiments all categories forming a subnetwork are disjoint sets. for instance, the categories gene and target do not have entities in common when forming the subnetwork gene × target. combining these <dig> biological categories, we have a network composed by <dig> subnetworks . of these, <dig> have <dig> dimensions, <dig> have <dig> dimensions, and <dig> has <dig> dimensions. in the current implementation of our model we neither use natural language processing <cit> nor heuristics to capture the context in which the entity names are applied in the documents. notwithstanding, the entity names we have selected were satisfactory for our purpose of validating the model, as we shall see. RESULTS network construction in our experiments the biological network has <dig> possible interactions. searching the patent claim collection our model has identified <dig> known interactions . based on these known interactions our model was able to infer <dig> new interactions. we have ranked the subnetworks according to their best new interactions . in most cases, subnetworks with few dimensions had the higher interaction levels. this happens because in a subnetwork with many dimensions it is more difficult to find documents in which entities of all dimensions co-occur. however, we find more accurate results in subnetworks with more dimensions because the model is able to better constrain the research space when we increase the number of dimensions of a dimensional space. drug acetylsalicylic acid gene apolipoprotein a 1 gene apolipoprotein e drug hydrochlorothiazide drug gene tamoxifen ppar-gamma validation removing patent claims from our collection according to the years in which they were issued and applying our model after each remotion, we observed that new interactions found in a year were confirmed by patent claims removed from the collection and issued in more recent years . for example, in order to better assess the quality of our model, we have analyzed known interactions established in the network in <dig> that became new interactions in <dig> when the patent claims issued in <dig> were removed from our textual collection . these known interactions in <dig> represent patents filed in <dig> that our model would have identified in <dig> thus, we used these known interactions in <dig> as confirmation patent claims for new interactions inferred in <dig> for instance, the interaction between the disease heart attack and the gene ppar-gama has <dig> patent claim issued in <dig> when we removed this patent claim from the collection, <dig> patent claims indicated this interaction as a new one in <dig> disease drug breast cancer tamoxifen removing all patent claims issued in <dig> our model predicted <dig> new interactions based on patents issued up to <dig> among these new interactions in <dig> we had <dig> confirmation patent claims filed in <dig> we then verified the top <dig> new interactions found in <dig> for each subnetwork in order to check whether these <dig> confirmation patents were among the highest ranked indications of our method . we have observed the distributions of confirmation patent claims when the known interactions were determined by the average, maximum and sum strategies applied over the similarities returned by the vsm. in the subnetwork disease × drug, for instance, we had <dig> new interactions in <dig> . this subnetwork had <dig> new interactions with confirmation patent claims issued in <dig> when we used the arithmetic average strategy for known interactions we had <dig> new confirmed interactions at the top <dig> new interactions of this subnetwork ranking. on the other hand, with the maximum and sum strategies we found <dig> new confirmed interactions at the top <dig> new interactions of this subnetwork. further, the first confirmed new interaction in this subnetwork is among the top <dig> interactions of the ranking and the second one is among the top <dig> when we used the arithmetic average strategy. in sum, when we applied the average, maximum and sum strategies, we found 53%, 56%, and 69% of the <dig> confirmation patents at the top <dig> new interactions of all subnetworks, respectively. in addition, we have looked for papers on the web in order to confirm some of the new interactions found in <dig> for instance, the best result found in our model relates the interaction between the androgen receptor gene and the adrenaline neurotransmitter in the 2-dimensional subnetwork gene × target. sastry et al. <cit> reported that the antiapoptotic effect of epinephrine partially depends on androgen receptor. a modest decrease in the antiapoptotic effect of epinephrine in cells where androgen receptor expression was reduced provides evidence that epinephrine reduces sensitivity of cancer cells to apoptosis. we have found confirmation papers on the web for the first new interaction of five 2-dimensional subnetworks . out of six 2-dimensional subnetworks, four have had their most relevant new interaction confirmed by later papers issued from <dig> up to <dig> in just one case we have not found a confirmation paper for the first new interaction, in the ranking of the 2-dimensional subnetwork drug × target. we have not found any confirmation paper for the first new interaction in the ranking of the 3-dimensional subnetworks neither for the 4-dimensional subnetwork. we have not looked for papers on the web for new interactions in other positions of the rankings in each subnetwork. hydrochlorothiazide aspirin apolipoprotein e apolipoprotein a-1 tamoxifen ppar-gamma example session research space of new interactions in our model, subnetworks with more dimensions constrain better the search space for new interactions, thus promoting more accurate results. for instance, consider a researcher using our system who is interested in new interactions related to the drug aspirin. initially, the researcher decides to analyze the interactions of aspirin with hmg-coa reductase, cachectin and acetylcholinesterase targets . our system shows that the best option would be to conduct research about the interaction between aspirin and acetylcholinesterase, since this interaction has a high interaction level and the other two are known interactions. therefore, our model predicts the interaction between aspirin and acetylcholinesterase as a very promising research topic. however, the researcher can still reach more precise results since the search space is still very large and these entities can interact with several other entities of distinct categories. in other words, the researcher may obtain even more accurate results when considering subnetworks with more dimensions. using a 3-dimensional subnetwork, the researcher now considers the dimension gene in the analysis. then, the researcher discovers that the interaction between aspirin and the acetylcholinesterase becomes less promising because no interaction between these entities is established in the 3-dimensional subnetwork. the researcher realizes that in the 3-dimensional subnetwork drug × gene × target the interaction between aspirin, hmg-coa reductase and leptin with interaction level l <dig> = <dig> becomes the most promising research topic. finally, going a step further by searching the 4-dimensional subnetwork, the researcher discovers that the interaction among aspirin, hmg-coa reductase, leptin and type <dig> diabetes with interaction level l <dig> = <dig> is in fact the most promising interaction for research. interaction history the history of how each new interaction may have been established in the network can be followed with the biosearch system. as an example, we observe the history of the new interaction with highest interaction level in the network when we used the arithmetic average strategy to determine the known interaction values. our model inferred this interaction in <dig> steps on the matrix of subnetwork gene × target . in the first step the model identifies the possible new interaction between the androgen receptor gene and the adrenaline target ). in the second step, the model finds three known interactions in the transitive closure. these known interactions produce an interaction level for the new interaction with value <dig> ). in the third step, the model finds other three known interactions in the transitive closure. in this case, the known interactions produce a new interaction with value <dig> ). no more possibilities are found for this new interaction. thus, the interaction level found at the third step becomes the interaction level of the new interaction because it is higher than that found in the second step. discussion we have been able to achieve significant results in a strategy that combines the vsm with an inference process in order to predict new biological entity activities. we have used this strategy to model biological systems and to construct a network of biological entity interactions. modeling biological systems is a complex task for many reasons. for example, we must consider a large number of biological parameters, we must identify entity concentrations and roles in different reactions, and we must bear in mind that biological systems are not linear systems and perturbations commonly give rise to unexpected results. thus, we have abstracted details and studied biological systems in a higher level in order to decrease their complexities and conduct our analysis <cit> . our abstraction of biological systems is constructed from textual collections that represent a particular view of the technological advances in life sciences reported in patent claims. in our model, we have focused on retrieving biological entity information from a textual collection consisting of patent claims using the vsm and expressing this information in a transitive closure. this approach has allowed several analysis with important findings. the approach has indicated the vsm as a useful tool to retrieve relevant information in an inference process and how the biological knowledge is interconnected in patent claims. texts in patents have a particular writing style characterized by a rich technical terminology and an intentional vagueness in order to promote wide protection to inventions <cit> . this intentional vagueness may bring a potential benefit to our inference strategy of new interactions. the vagueness in patent texts can indicate some known interactions not easily observed in other literatures characterized by a more strict writing style, as scientific papers. from these known interactions we can infer new ones that are even more innovative than those predicted from texts with strict writing style. as observed in some contemporary search engines, term co-occurrences is a good way to restrict the documents which can better satisfy an user information need. thus, term co-occurrences is a good strategy to isolate good hits from a big mass of documents. in addition, previous work in the field of literature-based discovery have indicated many important findings relying on term co-occurrences <cit> . particularly, jenssen et al. <cit> have shown that co-occurrences reflect biologically meaningful relationships, thus providing an approach to extract and structure known biological knowledge. accordingly, in our work we have relied on term co-occurrences in order to produce relevant results from a textual collection. our model has predicted <dig> new interactions considering patent claims issued up to <dig> in <dig> we have <dig> patent claims in which these new interactions are mentioned. these <dig> patent claims issued in <dig> serve as confirmations for the new interactions predicted in <dig> we have also observed that using the vsm we have ranked up to 69% of these <dig> new interactions among the <dig> first new interactions of all subnetworks. in other words, 69% of the confirmed interactions would have been identified within the top <dig> new indications of all subnetworks. these <dig> confirmation patent claims also demonstrate that implicit interactions not easily observed in a textual collection must be recognized as important contributions in the field of literature-based discovery. we consider the <dig> new interactions with confirmations as a significant number mainly when considering the reduction in the number of biotechnological patents filed from <dig> to <dig> <cit> , and the fact that patents are not filed for the majority of scientific discoveries, being instead published as research papers <cit> . in fact, we already expected a small number of confirmation patent claims for two main reasons. first due to the fact that these are patents filed in <dig> only one year after the new interactions were indicated by the collection issued up to <dig> a higher number of patents may have been filed in later years which would provide more indications. second, filing a patent is the final step of a long sequence of activities related to scientific discovery, and most researchers stop in the scientific article publication phase. as such, a large number of confirmation patent claims should probably never been expected. our findings have encouraged us to further investigate biological parameters we have to use in order to improve our representation of biological systems and achieve better results in the inference process and ranking strategy. these parameters have another important function in preventing noise propagation. interactions poorly established in the network propagate spurious interactions in the inference process. thus, this study should help impose constraints to the identification of interactions during network construction. the definition of these parameters for several sources and their integration in our model is also an important concern. in literature-based discovery, simple ranking strategies that promote new interactions based on the raw frequency of known interactions found in textual collections are often used. however, they show, in some situations, implicit interactions that have already been studied but were not documented because they are not feasible or are unwanted in practice. our results demonstrate, on the other hand, that ranking strategies based on the vsm are good tools for the identification of significant implicit interactions occurring in texts, mainly those occurring in few documents of a textual collection. this is an important contribution because it is far more difficult to find relevant new interactions from knowledge not frequently co-occurring in a literature than that often observed. however, we must always keep in mind that relevance is a subjective concept. therefore, biological entity interactions may be considered differently, i.e., with different importance, by different researchers. then, we must consider strategies in literature-based discovery as complementary tools that help to identify the best new interactions based on the researcher’s interests. in this sense, we should even think of systems in which new ranking strategies may be integrated as add-ons. we should also emphasize that our goal is not to ensure a complete coverage of the biological literature, creating an enormous network of known interactions. instead, we focus in providing a proof of concept to show the vsm applicability to disclose and rank biological entity activities based on implicit connections found in biological literature. accordingly, we have checked the existence of these implicit connections in patent claims using a small and restricted textual collection just for assessing the model. we are aware that many new interactions inferred by our model have already been reported in scientific papers. however, we have observed that these findings had not received patent protection at the uspto until <dig> and we have used some of these scientific papers as validation of our results, mainly due to the inexistence of textual collections currently available for validating literature-based discovery systems <cit> . for a production system we should index as much as possible of the current biological literature sources in order to filter prior art. nevertheless, we have observed that our strategy provides a good tool for tracking scientific advances published in scientific papers but not yet protected under the intellectual property law. CONCLUSIONS in this work we have introduced a technique that employs the vector space model for the identification of biological entity activities based on a network of biological entity interactions extracted from textual collections. the algebraic framework of the vsm has demonstrated to be a helpful tool in the task of finding known biological entity activities. we have extended the vsm with a transitive closure approach in order to predict new potential biological entity activities. the transitive closure we have used explores the primary and secondary activities of entities in a biological system. in addition, we have imposed a constraint in this transitive closure in order to ensure that interactions established in the network connect entities of distinct categories. this constraint reduces the search space for new interactions, promoting more accurate results. moreover, we have used the similarity values derived from the vsm to rank the new discovered entity activities. our experiments using a collection of uspto patent claims demonstrate that the biotechnological patent literature has implicit connections that can be explored to provide further advances in life sciences. iterating our model according to the years in which the patent claims were issued, new interactions found in a year were confirmed by patent claims not in the collection and issued in more recent years. the experiments also showed that many confirmation patent claims were found for interactions at the top of our ranks of results. for instance, considering the ranking strategy based on the sum of the similarities returned by the vsm we had 69% of the confirmation patents among the first <dig> new interactions of all subnetworks. we have also found scientific papers that validate several of the suggested interactions. for future work we intend to construct networks using other patent fields , the whole patent text, and other sources, such as paper abstracts, paper titles and drug labels. we will analyze the contribution of all these pieces of evidence in our inference process when they are considered separately and together. in addition, we intend to explore natural language processing techniques and ontologies in order to improve the identification of entity co-occurrences in the textual collection. moreover, we also want to conduct our analyses by considering entities co-occurring in one sentence, in a window of sentences, and in a whole paragraph in order to evaluate a phrase-based vsm approach in the context of our model. then, we will apply proximity criteria for these occurrences in order to ensure the semantic interaction between entities. furthermore, we will evaluate a set of biological parameters extracted from the literature in order to help with the establishment of interactions in the networks. finally, we intend to study other possible strategies to rank biological interactions and conduct a trend analysis on how the interaction value evolves when restricting the number of documents in the textual collection. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions wdm, acfc and svac conceived the project. acfc and svac directed the project. wdm conceived and designed the model; implemented and tested the algorithms; prepared and tested the data. wdm and mag conceived, designed and performed the computational experiment. acfc and svac provided support throughout the research process. acfc and svac hosted the biosearch system in their lab at ufmg. all authors analyzed the data and results; and wrote, read and approved the final paper. supplementary material additional file 1 appendix. a concise explanation of the biosearch system interface and the clusters of entity names we have used in our current experiments. click here for file acknowledgements wdm acknowledges support from capes by the grant of the special program biomicro. all authors acknowledge support from fapemig by the grant of publication fees. this article has been published as part of bmc genomics volume <dig> supplement <dig> 2011: proceedings of the 6th international conference of the brazilian association for bioinformatics and computational biology . the full contents of the supplement are available online at http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12?issue=s4",

    "prompt": "Summarize the procedural steps and outcomes outlined below. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems are complexes of a stable toxic- or growth-arresting factor and its unstable inhibitor <cit> . they are diverse, abundant in all bacteria, except a few intracellular parasites, and are found in many archaea <cit> . on the basis of their ubiquity and diversity, we can assume that regulation by ta must be common and beneficial in a wide range of microorganisms. however, their role in bacterial physiology is unclear <cit> , in part due to redundancy <cit> . they were first discovered in plasmids and characterized as addiction systems, which are responsible for post-segregational killing <cit> . however, because of its high cost to the host, such a stability mechanism is used only in rare cases <cit> . chromosomal ta loci were found thanks to full genome sequencing <cit> and were demonstrated to be functional, expressed at significant levels, and activated by various stressful conditions, particularly by amino acid starvation <cit> . our current study focuses on type ii ta systems. in this group, both the toxin and the antitoxin are proteins, which are encoded by adjacent co-transcribed genes. in a growing cell, toxins are neutralized by tightly bound antitoxins. antitoxins are degraded by proteases much more quickly than toxins, and if antitoxin production stops, toxins target vital functions of the producer through diverse mechanisms. many toxins are endoribonucleases and inhibit protein synthesis through cleavage of free or ribosome-bound mrna <cit> . mazf also cleaves 16s rrna <cit> and vapc endonucleases of enteric bacteria cleave initiator trna <cit> . another group of toxins interferes with dna gyrase <cit> , whereas hipa is a protein kinase <cit> , and zeta toxins inhibit cell wall synthesis <cit> . activation of toxins causes growth inhibition and dormancy that may be transient <cit> but in some circumstances is irreversible and leads to cell death <cit> . besides direct protein-protein interaction, antitoxins regulate toxin activity at the level of transcription. antitoxins are dna-binding proteins and specifically repress transcription of their own ta operons both alone and, even more effectively, in complexes with their cognate toxins. degradation of an antitoxin causes de-repression of the ta promoter <cit> and allows the toxin activity to be detected indirectly by measurement of transcript levels. gerdes and colleagues have demonstrated fine-tuning of transcription by the toxin:antitoxin ratio for the relbe system <cit> . the relb antitoxin in excess of the rele toxin promotes formation of the relb:rele complexes that bind to the operator sites and repress transcription. rele toxin in excess promotes formation of the reb:rele complexes that are unable to bind dna <cit> . as a result, over-expression of rele causes substantial increase in the relbe mrna level. these authors suggested that such transcriptional regulation by the t:a ratio is commonplace for ta loci <cit> and demonstrated it recently for vapbc <cit> . importantly, the levels of ta mrnas were increased in cell populations enriched for persisters, thereby linking ta systems to antibiotic susceptibility <cit> . persisters are transiently dormant bacteria that remain non-dividing under growth-supporting conditions and are not killed by bactericidal antibiotics <cit> . ta systems, by their very nature, may be primarily responsible for persister formation. mutations that increase toxicity of the ta toxins were shown to increase the frequency of persisters and cause high persistence phenotypes <cit> ; and deletion of the yafq toxin significantly decreased persister frequency in e. coli biofilms <cit> . a recent study reports that successive deletion of <dig> endoribonuclease-encoding ta loci progressively reduced the level of persisters while single deletions of ta systems had no effect on persister frequency in planktonic e. coli <cit> . hence, it is extremely important to consider redundancy and possible cross-talk when we study ta-related phenotypes, because most bacterial genomes contain multiple ta loci. in the current study we found that uninhibited toxins can activate transcription of the other ta operons. cleavage of these transcripts by endoribonuclease toxins adds another layer of complexity. reciprocal transcriptional de-repression and transcript cleavage predict that toxin-antitoxin systems have a potential to form a complex network of regulators that controls growth and dormancy of bacteria. RESULTS uninhibited toxins can activate other toxin-antitoxin systems excess of a toxin has been shown to destabilize binding of the toxin-antitoxin complex to operator dna and to activate transcription of its own operon <cit> . to test whether toxins can activate transcription of other ta operons, we measured the transcription of relbe in response to ectopic expression of toxins mazf, mqsr, yafq, hica, and hipa by northern hybridization . since the relbe genes are co-transcribed with the downstream relf <cit> , which encodes a hok-like toxin targeted against the inner membrane <cit> , we analyzed the transcription of the full relbef operon. in a reverse experiment, we over-expressed rele and monitored the transcription of several chromosomal ta operons . amino acid starvation is known to upregulate relbef transcription <cit> and was induced by addition of mupirocin <cit> as a positive control. ectopic expression of rele served as an additional positive control for activation of relbef transcription whereas synonymous substitutions were introduced into the plasmidal rele sequence to enable unambiguous detection of the chromosomal rele transcript. active rele toxin could be expressed from the altered gene and the plasmidal transcript was not detectable in the Δrelbef strain, showing that our hybridization probes are specific and do not cross-hybridize . toxins were induced in log phase cultures and concomitant measurements of optical density confirmed growth inhibition in all cultures tested . samples for rna isolation were collected before induction and during a two hour time-course post-induction ; mrna of the chromosomal ta operon was analyzed by northern hybridization using dna oligoprobes complementary to relb, rele, and relf . as shown in figure <dig> we indeed saw a clear cross-activation of relbef in response to all toxins tested except yafq. induction of rele, mazf, mqsr, hica and hipa conferred a clear increase in the relbef mrna level in an hour. use of three separate probes revealed, however, that different mrna species pile up in response to different toxins. before induction and <dig> min after, all three probes – relb, rele and relf – detected a transcript of the same size corresponding to the full-length mrna of the operon <cit> , as confirmed later by primer extension mapping of the 5′ end . only after mazf expression a shorter transcript, a putative cleavage product, could be detected at the <dig> min time point using rele probe . at later time points, hybridization with relb and rele probes gave different signals: in response to induction of mazf, mqsr, and hica we saw cleavage of the full-length mrna and massive accumulation of the toxin-encoding part, while the antitoxin-coding portion could not be detected and was apparently degraded . such cleavage and accumulation of the toxin portion also occurred in response to rele. hybridization with relf probe revealed additional cleavage, both within rele and downstream, in response to expression of all these toxins, and the relf part accumulated as the most abundant portion of the relbef transcript . also, some transcripts larger than the full relbef mrna appeared, particularly after induction of rele and mqsr. production of hipa, which is not a ribonuclease, conferred strong induction of full-length relbef mrna but cleavage and uneven accumulation of different mrna fragments could not be seen. mup treatment produced overproduction of the full relbef mrna as well as accumulation of some cleavage products. production of yafq did not lead to a clear cross-activation of relbef transcription. however, rele probe showed accumulation of a short rna fragment in response to this toxin. it is possible, that transcription of the operon is activated by yafq but the transcript is degraded to small fragments. clearly, these fragments cannot serve as templates for synthesis of rele and, therefore, functional cross-activation does not occur. modest induction of relbef with no cleavage was evident in the 1h and 2h samples of control cultures, lacking artificial production of any free toxin. we have to consider that, at this stage, the control cultures were approaching stationary phase, and induction of toxin-antitoxin modules has been described in similar conditions <cit> . probes complementary to yiaf and rpss were used for control because the levels of transcription of these genes did not differ between log phase cells and the ampicillin-refractory non-growing subpopulation, where ta operons were highly expressed <cit> . rpss is a part of the large s <dig> ribosomal protein operon with an estimated transcribed length of <dig> bp <cit> ; yiaf encodes for a putative membrane protein of unknown function; it is located between genes pointing in the opposite direction and must form a single-gene operon. the control mrnas were not induced by toxins . after induction of toxins, the yiaf transcript was degraded without accumulation of any stable fragments. . surprisingly, mupirocin initially induced transcription of yiaf whereas the level of the transcript dropped after longer incubation . the s <dig> transcript was degraded as well. some accumulating stable fragments of the s <dig> transcript were detectable after mazf, rele and mqsr production . to be sure that the accumulating rna fragments, which correspond to the 3′ portion of the relbef mrna, are not initiated from toxin-inducible cryptic promoters within the operon, we deleted the promoter of the relbef operon. in the promoterless bw <dig> Δprelbef strain, we did not see induction of the relbef mrna nor the characteristic accumulation of its 3′ portion . we still saw a transcript that could be detected by the rele and relf probes but the level of this transcript did not depend on the rele production. it might be initiated from a constitutive promoter that was newly created by deletion of prelbef. transiently induced smear of rna that was detected in bw <dig> Δprelbef with the relb probe is transcribed from the relb-expression plasmid pkp <dig> that is the reason why we omitted this plasmid when we studied induction of relbef in response to rele . thus, we can be sure that the shorter transcripts that massively pile up in response to toxins are indeed cleavage products and are initiated at the genuine prelbef promoter. next, we tested whether over-production of the toxin rele activates other toxin-antitoxin genes in the chromosome. the northern hybridization results show strong induction of the mqsra, mazef, dinj-yafq, hicab, yefm-yoeb, and prlf-yhav ta systems . similarly to relbef, the induced transcripts were cleaved and the toxin-encoding parts seem to accumulate preferentially while the antitoxin-coding parts are more effectively degraded. that appears to be true irrespective of whether the toxin is encoded by the first or the second gene of the operon . reliable testing of this phenomenon requires characterization of the cleavage products and additional experiments in the future. additional experiments indicated that transcriptional cross-activation of ta operons does not occur between all possible ta combinations. northern hybridization using mqsr probe showed that overproduction of mazf and hica does not induce the mqsra promoter while yafq and hipa induce it , as well as rele . activation of mazef by amino acid starvation is dependent on relbe we wanted to test whether ta cross-activation happens also during natural physiological stresses. amino acid starvation has been shown to induce transcription of the relbe <cit> and mazef <cit> genes. we induced amino-acid starvation by addition of mupirocin to the cultures of bw <dig> and bw25113Δrelbef. northern analysis indicated that transcription of mazef is upregulated only in wild type bacteria and not in the relbe deficient strain . transcription of mqsra, the other ta operon that we tested, was induced in both strains, independently of the relbe system . thus, relbe system activates another ta system, mazef, in response to amino acid shortage. this evidences that ta cross-activation is not a mere artifact of toxin overexpression but occurs as a part of a real physiological response. cross-activation occurs in lon, ppk, clpp, and hslv deficient strains since it is widely accepted that ta loci are activated by proteolytic degradation of antitoxins, we tested whether transcriptional cross-activation is affected by lon, clpp or hslv proteases. besides, we tested the requirement of polyphospate, which has been shown to activate lon <cit> . we expressed rele, mazf, and mqsr toxins in bw <dig> strain lacking lon or ppk, which encode for lon and polyphosphate kinase, respectively, and observed chromosomal relbef transcript by northern hybridization using probes rele and relf . deletion of lon or ppk did not abolish cross-induction of relbef by mqsr, and as seen on relf probed blot , by mazf. we further tested relbef activation in a double-knockout strain lacking lon and clpp, and a triple-knockout lacking lon, clpp and hslv proteases. again, expression of mazf and mqsr obviously induced relbef in the strains deficient for multiple proteases . accumulating rele-, mazf- and mqsr- specific cleavage intermediates produced similar patterns in all tested strains . production of yafq did not cause a clear activation of relbef transcription in the protease-deficient strains, similarly to the wt strain. accumulation of a small fragment hybridizing to the rele probe can be detected in the ΔclppxΔlonΔhslvu strain . ectopic production of rele induced transcription of chromosomal relbef in all strain backgrounds, as expected. essentially, we can conclude that cross-activation of ta transcription occurs also in lon-, ppk-, clppx-lon-, and clppx-lon-hslvu- backgrounds. cleavage of the relbef mrna in vivo to characterize the in vivo cleavage of relbef mrna in more detail, we mapped the 5′ ends of the cleavage products using primer extension analysis . as seen in figure <dig> the cleavage sites in the mrna, which was purified from the cells with over-expression of the nucleases mqsr and hica, are distributed all over the operon. several specific cutting sites of the mazf nuclease are found in the relb-encoding part. no cleavage is detected in response to production of the protein kinase hipa, as expected. most of the cutting sites were unique for each toxin indicating that the cleavage in vivo was a result of primary activity of the over-produced toxin. rna from mazf and mqsr over-expression samples was mostly cleaved at the specific cutting sites of these toxins, i.e. aca <cit> and gcu <cit> . however, several unique cleavage sites in the mazf and mqsr over-expression samples do not contain these sequences and might be generated by unidentified ribonuclease, possibly cross-activated toxins . we also observed that not all aca and gcu sequences were cleaved in the relbef mrna by mazf and mqsr, respectively. as before <cit> , the cleavage preferences of hica could not be identified. to confirm our notion of ta cross-activation, we hoped to see some cleavage hotspots. at those sites, strong cleavage by an overproduced toxin occurs at its specific cutting sequence . cleavage at the same site in response to expression of another toxin would indicate activation of the primary cutter by the over-produced toxin. we tested possible cross-activation at three of these sites. at position <dig> , the relbef transcript is cut by mazf and in response to the over-produced hica. the mqsr-specific cleavage sites at positions <dig> and <dig> are also cleaved in the samples from hica over-production . we found that these cuts were not due to the activation of mazf and mqsr, since they occurred in rna extracted from the bw25113Δmazef and bw25113Δmqsra cells . chpbk, a homolog of mazf with similar but relaxed sequence specificity <cit> may be accountable for the cleavage at <dig> . the cleavage products of relbef mrna can be translated into proteins the toxin-encoding parts of the ta transcripts seem to be generally more stable than the antitoxin-encoding parts and accumulate after cleavage . if the toxin open reading frame on these cleavage products is intact and translated into a functional protein, the t:a balance must be shifted towards toxin followed by more cleavage, cross-activation of other ta systems, and inhibition of protein synthesis. that creates the possibility of a positive feedback circuit and even a network of them. a positive autoregulatory loop, in turn, could explain the bistability of bacterial growth observed in response to toxin expression <cit> . to test whether proteins are translated from the cleaved relbef mrna, we used the t <dig> promoter for expression of two transcripts, which begin at the sites of mazf-inflicted cleavage, at positions + <dig> and + <dig> from the 5′ end of the full-length transcript, and extend downstream of the rele orf. the + <dig> rna starts immediately upstream of the relb orf . thus, the relb orf is leaderless and lacks the upstream untranslated region with the ribosome binding site . the + <dig> rna starts in the middle of the relb orf. to allow rele to be detected, we added the his <dig> tag to the c-terminus of the toxin and introduced substitutions r81a and r83a, which reduce its toxicity <cit> . expression of these rnas in bl <dig> resulted in production of the toxin rele-c-his, although in smaller quantities than from the control transcript with the intact 5′ end . thus, the accumulating cleavage products of ta mrna can be translated into proteins, although less effectively than full transcripts with intact rbs in front of relb. reduced translation of the downstream rele-c-his open reading frame in shorter transcripts suggests that rele lacks its own rbs and it is produced due to translational coupling of relbe genes. translational coupling of polycistronic ta mrna has been demonstrated previously for pard of plasmid r <dig> <cit> . transient expression of toxins can induce bistability of growth production of toxins causes an extensive rearrangement of bacterial physiology. it can inflict dormancy and antibiotic tolerance <cit> if the toxin level exceeds a threshold <cit> . fluctuations in toxin levels above and below the threshold have been used to explain the coexistence of dormant and growing cells in a population <cit> . the possibility of positive feedback by the generation and selective buildup of the toxin-encoding mrna fragments may explain this heterogeneity in growth. therefore, we wanted to evaluate the recovery of single bacteria and test possible growth heterogeneity after over-production of a toxin and the resulting activation of the chromosomal ta loci. we monitored growth resumption by individual cells using dilution of previously synthesized green fluorescent protein <cit> . the plasmid ptm <dig> was inserted into the chromosome of bw <dig> to allow iptg-inducible gfp to be expressed, and this strain was transformed with plasmids for l-arabinose-inducible production of toxins rele, mazf, mqsr and hipa. expression of gfp was induced for <dig> h; thereafter, the cells were transferred into medium containing l-arabinose to induce the toxins. after <dig> min, the growth medium was changed again to shut down toxin synthesis and allow recovery . analysis of the bacterial gfp content by flow cytometry showed that after temporary expression of rele and hipa the bacteria resumed growth rather uniformly, while after expression of mazf and mqsr a subpopulation started to grow with a delay. thus, expression of these toxins created bistability in a population. most importantly, all bacteria resumed growth after the transient expression of toxins. although inhibition by mazf and mqsr was apparently stronger and induced growth heterogeneity, it did not generate a subpopulation of persistently non-dividing bacteria . discussion mutual cross-activation of ta systems sequential or simultaneous activation of different ta systems has been reported elsewhere. transcription of several ta operons was induced in the persister-enriched subpopulation <cit> . amino acid starvation in e. coli activated both rele and mazf <cit> . we observed induction of the mqsra system in response to hipa activation <cit> , whereas overproduction of mqsr induced transcription of relbe and relf <cit> . also, ectopic expression of vapc toxins originating from salmonella and shigella activated yoeb <cit> and production of the doc toxin activated rele in e. coli <cit> . here, we show that overexpression of several toxins can activate transcription of the other ta operons. since toxins and ta operons in this study present a random sample, such cross-interactions might be common and be the rule rather than the exception. consequently, ta systems have a potential to form a cross-activation network, which operates at the transcriptional level . the presence of such network versus lone and uncoordinated ta systems must have an impact on ta activity during the stress response and setup of dormancy. induction of the chromosomal relbef in response to the ectopically produced rele can be explained by conditional cooperativity <cit> . however, according to our current knowledge, such mechanism is not applicable to cross-induction. activation of yoeb by vapc depended on lon protease <cit> . also, lon was required for induction of ta operons in response to amino acid starvation and chloramphenicol <cit> . our experiments do not provide a solid support for the role of lon and clpp in cross-regulation between ta systems of e. coli . since the cross-induction was present in the knock-out strains, an additional, lon-, clpp-, hslv-, and polyphosphate-independent mechanism of regulation must be involved. unlocking this mechanism remains a task for future studies. the simplest explanation to activation of ta systems would be depletion of antitoxins. it must inevitably happen when protein synthesis decreases. that predicts nonselective induction of all ta operons in response to inhibition of translation, no matter if it is caused by starvation or artificial production of a toxin. requirement of relbe for transcriptional activation of mazef during amino acid starvation contradicts this prediction as well as the lack of mqsra induction in response to overproduction of mazf and hica . an option for a mechanism of cross-activation is positive feedback regulation due to selective accumulation of toxin-encoding fragments upon mrna cleavage. as we saw, after cleavage by overproduced toxin, the antitoxin-encoding rna fragments are rapidly degraded while the toxin-encoding fragments may serve as templates for translation of toxin. different toxins produce different cleavage products. that can potentially explain why they cause unequal level of trans-activation when overproduced. another intriguing issue of ta cross-reaction is the possible cross-inhibition due to non-cognate interactions. some authors report such cross-reactions <cit> while others have tested but not found them <cit> . as a part of this study, we examined non-cognate inhibition between e. coli toxins and antitoxins of the relbe, mazef, mqsra, and hipba systems in vivo. in this attempt, we run into a previously described phenomenon that may become a source of erroneous results. if toxins are expressed from the arabinose-inducible pbad promoter and antitoxins from an iptg-inducible promoter, it is important to consider that iptg inhibits pbad directly <cit> . when we used an expression vector that encoded for the iptg-insensitive c280* version of arac transcriptional activator, we could not see any cross-inhibition. based on that, a recent report on functional non-cognate ta interactions in mycobacterium tuberculosis <cit> may require retesting. selective targeting of mrna by toxins as a mechanism of gene regulation in the current study, we found that the cleavage products produced by ta toxins differ in stability. selective targeting of mrnas by endoribonucleolytic toxins and different stabilities of the resulting cleavage products may constitute another layer of gene regulation in the bacterial stress response. differences in half-life and translational efficiency of mrna cleavage products, along with generation of a pool of ribosomes lacking the anti-shine-dalgarno sequence , could profoundly affect the proteome composition. an example of such an effect is the occurrence of a mazf-resistant protein pool in e. coli <cit> . the accumulation of toxin-encoding mrna fragments may have potential use as a marker of toxin activation in studies of stressed and non-growing bacteria. increase of the t/a ratio may possibly trigger a positive feedback loop consisting of transcriptional activation of the ta operon, successive cleavage of the ta transcript, buildup of the toxin-encoding mrna fragments, and translation of them, shifting the t/a balance . thus, it can be related to ta-linked growth heterogeneity in bacterial populations <cit> . CONCLUSIONS the main finding of this study is that bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems affect mutually each others’ expression and activity . we show that overexpression of one toxin can activate transcription of the other ta operons. toxins with endoribonuclease activity add another layer of complexity to these interactions. they cleave ta mrna, which is followed by degradation of the antitoxin-encoding rna fragments and accumulation of the toxin-encoding fragments. we show that these accumulating mrna fragments can be translated to produce more toxin. most of bacteria have many different ta systems. although their function is debatable, many ta toxins have similar activity and the inhibitory effect on bacterial cells is common to all of them. therefore, an important question is whether ta systems are redundant or not. another intriguing issue is whether different ta systems are functionally connected and do cross-talk <cit> . here we over-expressed toxins to show that ta systems have a potential to form a network of cross-reacting regulators in e. coli. we found an example of such cross-reaction, which occurs without artificial overexpression: the relbe-dependent transcriptional activation of mazef during amino acid starvation. it remains a rather difficult task to identify the mechanism of ta cross-activation. currently we know that cross-activation is not dependent on major proteases lon, clpp, and hslv. also, it cannot be a self-evident outcome of antitoxin shortage since we know examples where shutdown of protein synthesis does not activate a ta promoter.",

processes in living cells. these interactions are mediated through the respective molecular surfaces and are governed by the properties of the amino acid residues and atoms, which form these surfaces, as well as more distributed properties such as hydrophobicity and electrostatic potential. structural data from crystallographic analyses deposited in the protein data bank <cit> contain a vast amount of information on protein-protein contacts, including \"biological\" contacts which are also present in solution as well as contacts necessary for crystal formation. several programs are available which allow the calculation and analysis of surface properties, e.g. to predict hotspots for protein interaction <cit> . however, these programs are not designed to calculate, analyze and visualize actual protein-protein contact patches. various reviews describe investigations about statistical analyses of protein-protein interaction, characterization of different interface properties <cit> and the identification of contact patches especially focused on the distinction between biological interactions and crystal contacts <cit> . other studies describe specific properties used to discriminate between interfaces and non-interfaces like shape and geometric parameter complementarities, accessible surface comparison at multimerization as well as physicochemical properties, conservation scores and interface residue preferences and clusters <cit> . despite the fact that this information is very useful for the identification and analysis of biological contacts, it lacks a convenient visual representation of information especially for crystal contact surfaces and their properties. a plethora of macromolecular visualization tools exist, which are either web-based or stand alone programs . most of them also provide structural analysis tools or are part of different databases which contain all sorts of organized structural annotation information like the gpssserver <cit> , the mark-us server <cit> , the polyview-3d utility <cit> , or the program pocketpicker <cit> . there are also databases which are mainly focused on protein contacts or interfaces like the scowlp <cit> . this database is based on the scop <cit> classification and provides interaction information on domain interfaces and uses jmol <cit> for visualization. web based visualization tools like jmol are very useful to give an overview of the structure including of the different provided information. however, they are less powerful than stand-alone programs like the swiss-pdb viewer <cit> or pymol <cit> . not all of these tools provide sufficient surface representation features or the surface representation is generated on the fly. consequently, the actual surface points are not accessible directly for annotation or calculation purposes. software packages which do provide contact interaction information most often make use of atom to atom distances and atom coordinates instead of surface point coordinates. many programs also do not take into account crystal symmetry. therefore, we devised vasco a program package enabling the annotation and visualization of surface properties and contact patches. specifically we aimed at identifying contact patches in protein crystal structures including contacts generated by crystal symmetry, annotating these patches according to different surface properties and analysing surface patches of proteins in contact with rna, dna or ligands. additional aims were the convenient representation of annotated surfaces and the development of a distance calculation for the surface points in contact regions. for visualization we chose pymol because of its wide spread within the structural biology community and its broad functionality and expandability. implementation vasco itself is a python <cit> based command line tool which makes use of the vasco modules to calculate properties and run external programs. the programs patchcalc and hydrocalc, written in c, are used to calculate hydrophobicity as well as contact patches and distance values. the external programs msms <cit> for surface calculation and delphi <cit> for electrostatics calculations are separately available and licensed but included in the program package. the vasco package integrates the calculation of molecular surfaces of proteins, the computation of different properties , the identification of contact patches, and a flexible visualization module. for the latter task we use the program pymol <cit> representing molecular surfaces as \"compiled graphic objects\" , a pymol specific format allowing the generation of three-dimensional objects from building blocks such as spheres, cylinders and triangles. we developed a plug-in, which reads the vasco surface file and generates cgos based on the provided information. this phython-based plug-in provides a convenient interface to visualize the surface output. RESULTS vasco is a program package for the calculation of protein surface properties and the visualization of annotated surfaces. our software uses a unique surface point based approach where each of these points can be directly annotated by different properties. the surfaces and interaction patches are visualized in pymol using a custom-made plug-in. surface points are defined by the solvent excluded surface of a protein. in addition, it identifies contact patches between protein molecules based on a point distance cutoff, considering also symmetry equivalent molecules in a crystal. thus, surface points are separated into contact and non-contact areas allowing separate analysis. the current set of properties contains the electrostatic potential, the hydrophobicity and the contact distance and is easily extendable due to the modular structure of the program package. the different modules and programs are integrated into an analysis pipeline to allow fast and efficient analysis of the protein structures. special emphasis was given to the visualization of crystal contact patches and surfaces which is especially important for the analysis of this kind of data. we do not distinguish between biological and crystal contact patches automatically, yet the patch information with the mapped properties may help to differentiate them visually. our software can serve as a supplement to other available visualisation tools and provides additional information on protein-protein contacts which are relevant for structural biologists and crystallographers as well. another strength of the vasco program is the possibility to compare molecular surfaces of biomolecules. to that end, a pdb file has to be generated containing two superimposed structures . by neglecting the symmetry information one is able to annotate surfaces with a surface difference value which corresponds to the minimum distance of a particular surface point in one molecule to any surface point in the other molecule. these calculations can be used to identify regions on those surfaces which differ significantly from each other or to investigate the influence of mutations on surface shape. calculation pipeline the python based command line program called vasco.py, reads a pdb file and in turn calls the various modules and programs performing the necessary calculations . the output of the program is a gzip-compressed text file containing information on the surface itself as well as on the calculated properties, which can be visualized in pymol using the vasco surface viewer plug-in . reasonable default parameters and libraries are provided, but can easily be changed for particular purposes. surface determination molecular surface points are determined by msms version <dig> . <dig> <cit> using the ses definition, a probe radius of <dig> Å and a vertex density of <dig> . there are other surface calculation programs available including naccess <cit> , surface racer <cit> , asc <cit> , or the molecular surface package <cit> . we chose the program msms because it provides surface point files with additional information such as triangulation and normal vectors which can be used directly for visualization. hydrophobicity the command line program hydrocalc was developed to calculate hydrophobicity values at each surface point. a library of atomic hydrophobic contribution values was created based on the values derived by ghose et al. <cit> and newer calculations of viswanadhan and ghose et al. <cit> . these hc values can be seen as fragmental increments to the total lipophilicity of the molecule. andry et al. have created a distance dependent function for a so called molecular lipophilicity potential <cit> the applicability of which has been proven for small molecules. due to its unsuitability for large molecules another form of the mlp definition was used <cit> . mlp=∑i=1nfi⋅g∑i=1ng formula 1: molecular lipophilicity potential . fi is the partial lipophilicity of the i-th fragment of a molecule. di is the distance of the surface point from the center of the fragment i. n is the amount of fragments considered for the calculation and g is the distance function for the i-th fragment. the program uses a fermi-type distance function <cit> to calculate the contribution of a particular atom to the molecular lipophilicity potential at a certain surface point. the empirical drop-off parameters c <dig> and c <dig> were set to standard values . the fermi-function simulates the decrease of hydrophobic influence of distant atoms to avoid false assignments within protein molecules. g=e−c1c2+1ec1+ <dig> formula 2: fermi-type distance function. c <dig> and c <dig> are empirical drop-off parameters. d is the distance of a certain surface point from the center of the fragment. compared to other algorithms to assign hydrophobicity values to surface points, this approach has the advantage that the hydrophobicity calculation can be carried out with distance dependent atomic contributions on every surface point separately. this is in contrast to other strategies where whole amino acid hydrophobicity scores are used and mapped onto the surface <cit> . our calculation is clearly more time consuming but has the advantage that the hydrophobicity is smoothly distributed over the surface. due to its distance dependent character it accounts for the three dimensional arrangement of the atoms and their contributions to the hydrophobicity on each surface point. electrostatic potential the program delphi <cit> is used to calculate the electrostatic potential at the molecular surface points. as default parameters we used a grid spacing of <dig> Å with the macromolecule taking up 60% of the calculation box. internal and external dielectric constants were set to <dig> and <dig> respectively. an ion exclusion radius of <dig> Å and a salt concentration of <dig> mol l- <dig> were applied. the probe radius for the surface calculation is the same as used for msms . all parameters can be changed by the user, if necessary. delphi requires the positions of hydrogen atoms. as most of the structure files deposited in the pdb miss this information, we calculate hydrogen atom positions using a modified version of the program protonate, which is part of the amber program package <cit> . we consider only backbone and n-terminal hydrogen atoms and assign charges only to fully charged amino acids as well as backbone atoms. histidines are assigned a total charge of + <dig> . the delphi output file contains the electrostatic potential at the given coordinates in units of kt/e , where k is the boltzmann-constant and the temperature t is set to <dig> k. contact patch calculation the program patchcalc was developed to calculate interaction patches based on a distance cutoff involving surface points. this includes interactions between different unit surfaces as well as interactions between symmetry related surface points. we define a \"unit\" as an assembly of protein chains for which surface points and corresponding properties will be calculated. by default each protein chain forms a separate unit, but one can combine several chains to a larger unit, e.g. to an oligomer. the combination of all thus defined units forms the so called \"partition\". the command line program patchcalc calculates all the contact patches of each unit within a partition . a surface point contact is assumed, when the distance between surface points is below a certain threshold, which is <dig> Å by default but can be changed by the user. in order to utilize crystal symmetry the program requires information on the unit cell and on the space group, which is both provided automatically within the vasco-program. atomic cartesian coordinates are transformed to fractional coordinates <cit> . space group symmetry is provided as library of transformation matrices and vectors which are applied to the fractional coordinates. nearest neighbors of a particular surface point are identified taking translational symmetry into account. the final output contains the point to point distance as well as unit and symmetry information which are used to annotate the different contact patches. visualization a pymol plug-in was developed for displaying the surface properties calculated by the vasco program. each identified surface contact patch can be viewed and analyzed separately. the user can freely define colours and transparency levels of the different surfaces. the minimum and maximum values for a colour ramp describing a certain property are calculated automatically, but can as well be set manually . to speed up loading of the surface representation the user can select to view just those annotated surfaces, which are the current focus of interest. after loading of the surfaces one can switch fast and easily between the annotated surfaces by using the standard function keys. because pymol's internal ray-tracing routine also works for the additional properties calculated by the program package, it can be used to create high-resolution, publication quality figures. the plug-in configures itself depending on the available surface properties in the input file and is therefore flexible to show different properties depending on the currently active surface file. this feature will be especially useful when new surface properties will be provided in later versions of the vasco program package. examples surface property visualization the vasco program can be used to visualize surface interaction patches between different units as well as to analyse crystal contact patches calculated with crystal symmetry information. the structure of a gun <dig> homolog <cit> was chosen as an example. the asymmetric unit of this structure consists of a single polypeptide chain with a length of <dig> amino acid residues. as the structure comprises only one chain, this chain forms the only unit. figure <dig> shows the molecular surface coloured according to hydrophobicity and electrostatic potential employing the default colour ramp. figures 3c and 3d contain information on interactions with symmetry related molecules . interaction patches are coloured according to contact distances and to patch types . the latter are defined by the interacting unit and the applied symmetry operation. another example of the results of contact patch calculation is shown in figure <dig> the antizyme inhibitor which regulates cellular polyamine homestasis is compared with the highly homologous orithine decarboxilase which is in contrast to azi enzymatically active <cit> . figures 4a and 4b show all contact patches for chain a of azi <cit> and chain a of odc <cit> , respectively. in the case of odc two protein chains are present in the asymmetric unit, but a very similar \"dimer\" of azi is generated by crystal symmetry . a visual comparison of the proposed dimer interfaces reveals a significantly smaller surface contact size in the case of azi as well as a more compact contact surface in the case of odc . this analysis suggests that this interface in azi could be an artefact of crystal formation and nonphysiological. biochemical studies indeed showed that azi exists as a monomer in solution while odc is dimeric <cit> . in addition, the \"hydrophobic zipper\" <cit> can easily be seen on the odc dimer interface which is missing in case of the azi . thus, vasco can be very helpful in getting a first visual impression of the interfaces and their properties. visualization of surface differences the comparison of molecular surfaces of biomolecules is an additional strength of the vasco program. a specific example of a surface comparison involving two homologous rna binding proteins is shown in figure <dig> highlighting surface differences between signal recognition particle <dig> from h. sapiens <cit> and methanococcus jannaschii <cit> . another example shows the active site of two old yellow enzyme homologues . these two enzymes exhibit opposite enantioselectivity in the reduction of a nitroalkene substrate, which is supposed to be caused by subtle structural differences <cit> . the differences in the surface topography around the active sites of opr <dig> <cit> and opr <dig> <cit> are shown in figure <dig> by mapping minimum point distances onto the respective molecular surfaces. in this example, red areas indicate surface indentations which are not present in the other molecule, whereas green areas indicate convexities. specifically, the red area close to the flavin cofactor in opr <dig> emphasizes a deep pocket missing in opr <dig> which, however, is important for the proper binding of the substrate . the lack of this pocket in opr <dig> necessitates a different binding mode of the substrate thereby yielding the opposite enantiomer. our tools provide a convenient way to visualize such differences and to analyze their biological significance. CONCLUSIONS the vasco package provides convenient tools for the representation of annotated surfaces. it allows the facile inclusion of new properties for surface mapping. the calculated surface is always divided into patch and non-patch surfaces allowing separate visual analysis of these regions. the tool also provides a unique point distance approach for the analysis and visualization of surface differences between two structures. by using the common protein representation and visualization tool pymol as environment for the plug-in, the annotated surfaces can be visualized. the plug-in automatically accommodates additional surface properties provided in the input file. we expect that vasco will expand and grow over time especially by integrating new surface properties and property calculations. availability and requirements project name: vasco project home page: . operating systems: windows, unix programming languages: python, c software packages: python <dig> or higher , pymol <dig> or higher hardware requirements: processor: <dig> ghz pentium <dig> or similar, memory: <dig> gb ram video card: 3d opengl compatible graphics accelerator card with <dig> mb ram license: the vasco program is free for academic use but includes third party programs like the msms program for surface calculation and the delphi v. <dig> program for electrostatic calculations which have to be registered . for more information about licensing see any restrictions to non-academics: if you are interested in a commercial use license for vasco, please send your name, address, fax and telephone numbers and email address to: vasco@genome.tugraz.at. commercial versions of msms and delphi have to be obtained from .michel f. sanner and .raquel norel respectively. authors' contributions gs designed and implemented the software and drafted the manuscript. rr was involved in software design and testing. ggt contributed to the draft of the manuscript, webpage creation and coordination of software packaging and licensing. kg participated in the design and implementation of hydrocalc and patchcalc and helped to draft the manuscript. general scientific advice was given by ck and kg. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. supplementary material additional file 1 calculated hc values for amino acids. the data table provided contains the calculated hydrophobic contribution values for the standard amino acids. click here for file acknowledgements this work was supported by the austrian federal ministry of science and research through the gen-au project bin ii and by the research centre applied biocatalysis. we want to acknowledge markus c. jorde who was involved in parts of the coding of hydrocalc and patchcalc and daniel friedl who helped to write the installation manual as well as gustav oberdorfer who provided the docked nitroalkene structures. we would also like to thank michel f. sanner and raquel norel for allowing us to integrate and distribute their programs along with vasco.",

which one-carbon units at various oxidation levels can be attached at the n <dig> and n <dig> positions . in natural folates the pterin ring is in the dihydro or tetrahydro state, and a short, γ-linked polyglutamyl tail of up to about eight residues is usually attached to the first glutamate. tetrahydrofolates serve as cofactors in one-carbon transfer reactions during the synthesis of purines, formylmethionyl-trna, thymidylate, pantothenate, glycine, serine, and methionine <cit> . most folate-dependent enzymes strongly prefer polyglutamates to monoglutamates, but the opposite is usually true of folate transporters so that polyglutamylation is generally considered to favor folate retention within cells and subcellular compartments <cit> . plants, fungi, certain protists, and most bacteria make folates de novo, starting from gtp and chorismate, but higher animals lack key enzymes of the synthetic pathway and so require dietary folate <cit> . folates are crucial to human nutrition and health <cit> , and antifolate drugs are widely used in cancer chemotherapy and as antimicrobials <cit> . for these reasons, folate synthesis and salvage pathways have been extensively characterized in model organisms, and the folate synthesis pathway in both bacteria and plants has been engineered in order to boost the folate content of foods <cit> . the de novo folate synthesis pathway has the same steps in bacteria and plants, and consists of a pterin branch and a paba branch . the first enzyme of the pterin branch is gtp cyclohydrolase i , which catalyzes a complex reaction in which the five-membered imidazole ring of gtp is opened, c <dig> is expelled as formate, and a six-membered dihydropyrazine ring is formed using c <dig> and c <dig> of the ribose moiety of gtp <cit> . the resulting <dig> -dihydroneopterin triphosphate is then converted to the corresponding monophosphate by a specific pyrophosphatase <cit> . removal of the last phosphate is believed to be mediated by a non-specific phosphatase <cit> . dihydroneopterin aldolase then releases glycolaldehyde to produce 6-hydroxymethyl- <dig> -dihydropterin, which is then pyrophosphorylated by hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase . dhna also interconverts <dig> -dihydroneopterin and <dig> -dihydromonapterin, and cleaves the latter to 6-hydroxymethyl- <dig> -dihydropterin. a paralog of dhna, folx, interconverts the triphosphates of <dig> -dihydroneopterin and <dig> -dihydromonapterin, and also catalyzes the same reactions as dhna at very slow rates <cit> . in the paba branch of the pathway, chorismate is aminated to aminodeoxychorismate by adc synthase using the amide group of glutamine as amino donor <cit> . adc is then converted to paba by adc lyase <cit> . 6-hydroxymethyl- <dig> -dihydropterin pyrophosphate and paba moieties are condensed by dihydropteroate synthase . the resulting dihydropteroate is glutamylated by dihydrofolate synthase giving dihydrofolate , which is reduced by dihydrofolate reductase to tetrahydrofolate . folylpolyglutamate synthase then adds a γ-glutamyl tail. in escherichia coli, it has been reported that there can also be α linkages in the distal part of the polyglutamyl tail <cit> . although the biosynthetic steps are the same in plants and bacteria, the plant pathway is split between three subcellular compartments, with pterin synthesis in the cytosol, paba synthesis in chloroplasts, and the other steps in mitochondria <cit> . fpgs isoforms are present in all three of these compartments, as are folates themselves <cit> . folates – both poly- and monoglutamates – are also found in plant vacuoles <cit> . the highly compartmented nature of folate synthesis in plants implies the existence of pterin and folate transporters that are integral components of the pathway. folate-related salvage pathways are of three kinds. the first enables utilization of supplied folic acid and dhf, and relies on a dhfr activity to reduce these oxidized folates to thf, and on an fpgs activity <cit> . dhfr activity is also required to recycle the dhf produced in the reaction catalyzed by thymidylate synthase . the second kind of salvage , known in leishmania and other trypanosomatid parasites, involves the reduction of fully oxidized pterins to the dihydro and tetrahydro levels by pteridine reductase <dig> <cit> . this enables oxidized pterins to be used for folate synthesis, and as cofactors for aromatic hydroxylases and other pterin-dependent enzymes. finally, some bacteria, plants, and protists probably carry out a more radical kind of salvage, in which the pterin and paba-glutamate fragments produced by folate breakdown are recycled for folate synthesis <cit> . this type of salvage has been little studied and will not be considered further in this article. genes for all the enzymes of folate synthesis have been identified in model organisms such as escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . likewise, the intact folate salvage pathway has been well characterized in mammals, the malaria parasite plasmodium, and lactobacillus casei <cit> , and pterin salvage in leishmania <cit> . however, analysis of the distribution of known folate synthesis and salvage genes in hundreds of bacterial genomes using the seed platform <cit> reveals that much remains to be learnt about both synthesis and salvage. the seed is a freely available, open-source database that provides efficient ways to discover new genes or pathways, to generate predictions about gene function, and to improve annotations, based on a 'functional subsystem approach' <cit> . this approach has much in common with metabolic reconstruction <cit> . a functional subsystem may be defined as a set of functional roles jointly involved in a biological process. a typical subsystem is a group of enzymes, transporters, and regulatory components that participate in a metabolic pathway such as folate synthesis or salvage. subsystem analysis examines which components are actually present in a genome and which should be present but cannot be identified, and so provides a picture of what is actually missing. this sets the stage to pursue the 'missing genes', also termed 'pathway holes' <cit> . homology-based searches alone are usually unable to locate missing genes that have not been previously identified in any genome or those that are missing due to non-orthologous gene replacement <cit> . in this study, we first predicted the pathways present in around four hundred sequenced bacteria and identified cases of missing genes for almost every step of the synthesis pathway. candidates for such missing genes in bacteria and plants were then predicted using comparative genomic tools and representative candidates were tested experimentally. RESULTS are folates essential in all bacteria? as folate-dependent formylation of the initiator trna is a hallmark of bacterial translation and bacteria cannot import formylmethionyl-trna <cit> , we investigated the distribution of the fmt gene encoding methionyl-trna formyltransferase as a signature gene for a folate requirement. homologs of fmt are found in all sequenced genomes except mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and onion yellows phytoplasma oy-m . we confirmed the observation <cit> that m. hyopneumoniae lacks all the enzymes of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism except for glycine hydroxymethyltransferase , which has aldolase activities that do not require folate <cit> . another widespread folate-dependent metabolic step is the conversion of dtmp to dump, catalyzed by thymidylate synthase . this step can also be performed by a folate- and flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase <cit> . as first observed by myllykallio et al. <cit> , most bacteria have a thya or a thyx homolog, some have both, and the few that have neither – such as m. hyopneumoniae or ureaplasma parvum – contain the tdk gene encoding the thymidine salvage enzyme thymidine kinase. our genomic analysis suggests that m. hyopneumoniae strains are the only sequenced bacteria that do not require folate for initiator trna formylation or thymidylate synthesis. the situation in the phytoplasma that lacks the fmt gene is different; it contains a thya homolog like most mycoplasma species and therefore presumably requires intact folates. a combination of the presence dhfr <dig> dhfr <dig> or dhfr2; b combination of the presence of folc and folc2; : gene identified; blankcell with : no gene identified; : predicted missing gene intact folate transport and salvage as just discussed, folate is most probably essential for all sequenced bacteria except m. hyopneumoniae. however, not all bacteria synthesize folate de novo but instead rely on an external supply . to predict the absence of the de novo synthesis pathway, the hppk and dhps proteins were used as signature proteins . many bacteria lack homologs of both these genes and so almost certainly rely on reducing and glutamylating intact folates taken up from the environment. these are mainly host-associated bacteria such as mycoplasma or treponema or organisms that live in folate-rich environments such as lactobacilli. chloroplasts and vacuoles must likewise take up folates from the cytoplasm , and there is also evidence for folate uptake by intact plant cells <cit> . transport systems that mediate folate uptake in auxotrophs such as lactobacillus casei and l. salivarius have been partially biochemically characterized <cit> , but the corresponding genes remain unknown. whatever they are, they are most likely unrelated to mammalian folate carriers since these lack close homologs among bacteria and plants. however, cyanobacteria, which are folate prototrophs, have a protein with significant similarity to a folate carrier from leishmania species , and the cyanobacterial protein has a close homolog in plants , as well as several more distant relatives in plants and in alpha-, beta-, and gamma-proteobacteria. we showed first that the cyanobacterial protein conferred the ability to transport folates and folate analogs when expressed in e. coli, and then that its plant homolog did the same <cit> . we further showed that the arabidopsis at2g <dig> protein is located in the chloroplast envelope <cit> . the weak slr <dig> homolog in some alpha-proteobacteria clusters with the folate-dependent enzyme sarcosine dehydrogenase, suggesting that this protein may also be a folate transporter. thus, despite progress in identifying folate transporters in cyanobacteria and in the chloroplast envelope, there are as yet no candidates for the folate carriers in many folate-requiring bacterial taxa, or in plant mitochondrial, vacuolar, and plasma membranes. these still-missing genes are future prospects for discovery by comparative genomics methods <cit> . reduction as noted above, dhfr is essential in both de novo and salvage pathways. most bacteria have a fola gene , but two other bacterial enzymes able to reduce dhf are now known: folm belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family <cit> , and a flavin-dependent dihydropteroate reductase that is fused to dihydropteroate synthase . <cit> . the trypanosomatid enzyme ptr <dig> can also reduce dhf and folic acid <cit> . as folm occurs in e. coli and other bacteria that also have a fola gene, its normal function is most probably not folate reduction, as discussed in a later section. the annotation of dhfr <dig> family members is complicated by their similarity to pyrimidine dehydrogenase family members , which are numerous in actinomycetes like streptomyces coelicolor. at this stage we named them all dhfr <dig> but further genetic or biochemical analysis is needed to check these assignments. analysis of the distribution of dhfr genes in bacterial genomes reinforced the conclusions <cit> that many bacteria such as prochlorococcus marinus lack any recognizable dhfr proteins, and that most of these organisms use thyx and not thya. even if a high capacity for dhf reduction is not needed in thyx-dependent organisms <cit> , these do require some dhfr activity to complete the de novo or salvage pathways so the corresponding gene have yet to be identified in these organisms <cit> . glutamylation folc-like proteins can have fpgs activity alone <cit> or both dhfs and fpgs activities <cit> , which complicates annotation. although the bifunctional type has a unique dihydropteroate binding site <cit> , it overlaps the rest of the substrate binding site and we could not derive a motif to distinguish mono- and bifunctional enzymes. we therefore annotated them all as bifunctional. by analogy with the lactococcus. lactis situation, we predict that organisms reliant on the salvage pathway will have a monofunctional fpgs. the folc gene is missing in the mycoplasma species that contain an fmt, a thya and a fola gene and must therefore rely on a salvage pathway . this absence points to three possibilities for these species: they import folate polyglutamates; they have a novel type of fpgs gene; or they import monoglutamyl folates and polyglutamylation is not needed. we favor the last hypothesis as there is evidence for monoglutamyl folate uptake in mycoplasma mycoides <cit> . a similar situation must exist in bacteria such as borrelia burgdorferi that lack all folate synthesis genes but contain thf-dependent enzymes such as fmt . de novo folate biosynthesis the majority of sequenced bacteria contain all genes of the pathway and are therefore predicted to be prototrophic for folate . however, a substantial minority lack just one or a few genes of the pterin or paba branches, and detailed analysis of these cases reveals several biologically significant points. * prediction not experimentally verified; # fused proteins; underlined and bold: physical clustering; : gene identified; : no identified gene; : predicted missing gene. the pterin branch the first enzyme of this branch, gchy-i, is encoded in e. coli by the fole gene. a recent analysis of the distribution of fole genes among bacterial genomes showed the fole gene to be locally missing in one-third of them <cit> . another protein family, cog <dig> was found to responsible for <dig> -dihydroneopterin triphosphate formation in these organisms. this protein was named gchy-ib and the corresponding gene fole <dig> <cit> . further analysis revealed that a few bacteria such as wolbachia, chlamydia, and chlamydophila species lack both fole and fole <dig> homologs whereas they contain the signature genes of the pathway folkp , suggesting that another family of gchy-i enzymes has yet to be identified. for instance, at least certain chlamydia species are known to synthesize folates de novo <cit> , but lack fole and fole <dig> a candidate for the missing gcyh-i enzyme was the chlamydia trachomatis protein ct <dig> and its homologs, which cluster with the folabkp folate genes in chlamydia and wolbachia species . the protein is homologous to the pyrroloquinoline quinone biosynthesis protein pqqc that catalyzes an overall eight-electron oxidation, leading to a pyrrole and pyridine ring, but their active sites are not conserved, consistent with a different enzymatic activity <cit> . the ct <dig> gene was cloned in pbad <dig> but failed to complement the dt auxotrophy of the e. coli fole mutant. the strong linkage of ct <dig> homologs with folate genes certainly points to a function in folate metabolism as other de novo folate genes than fole are missing in chlamydiae such as folq or pabaabc , but further studies are needed to determine its functional role. the second step of folate synthesis is the removal of pyrophosphate. although an enzyme mediating this step had been demonstrated in e. coli <cit> , no gene was known from any organism. we identified a dhntp pyrophosphatase candidate in l. lactis as part of the folkepqc gene cluster <cit> . folq belongs to the nudix hydrolase family <cit> . biochemical and genetic tests confirmed dhntp pyrophosphatase activity <cit> . furthermore, the closest arabidopsis homolog of l. lactis folq was also shown to have this activity <cit> . since the nudix family is large and functionally heterogeneous it is not very amenable to projection of annotations just by homology. folq homologs with a high homology score occur in rather few bacteria, so that the dhntp pyrophosphatase gene is still missing in most genomes, including e. coli. other putative phosphohydrolases unrelated to folq, folq <dig> members of the hdig superfamily, are found in some folate-related gene clusters , such as cpe <dig> in clostridium perfringens; these genes are good candidates for alternatives to folq but again have a limited phylogenetic distribution leaving the problem open in most bacterial species . the third specific enzyme of the pathway, dhna, is encoded in e. coli by the folb gene. this gene and its paralog folx <cit> appear to be missing in many phylogenetically diverse bacteria such as geobacter metallireducens. genome and functional context analysis allows the prediction that the dhna role is played by members of the transaldolase family . specifically, about half the bacteria that lack dhna have a transaldolase encoding gene that clusters with folk genes in several organisms . this prediction awaits experimental validation as this transaldolase family is broad and only some of its members might encode a dhna aldolase. some genomes such as rickettsia felis lack both folb and transaldolase homologs while containing all the other de novo enzymes , again suggesting that another family of folb enzymes has yet to be identified unless the pathway is on its way to elimination in these organisms specifically. hppk and dhps are distinctive proteins found in all organisms that make folate de novo and so, as noted above, these were used as pathway signature genes. a few sporadic organisms apparently lack one of the two genes, but further analysis shows that this is usually because of a gene-calling problem or because the corresponding genome is still incomplete. some organisms, however, have two folp genes or two folk genes . are these functionally redundant or catalyzing different reactions? in most cases one paralog is clustered with folate genes and the other clusters with genes involved in different pathways . for instance, in the high-gc gram-positive group the second folp clusters with cell wall synthesis genes. in mycobacterium leprae the folp <dig> gene does not complement an e. coli folp mutant whereas the copy that clusters with the folate genes does, suggesting that folp <dig> is involved in another pathway <cit> . folk is duplicated in many organisms. in most cases such as shewanella denitrificans , one copy is in a folate operon and the other in a pantothenate operon but there are several cases where both genes are close to other folate biosynthesis genes . only experimental testing will show whether both copies are active. it is of note that an internal duplication of folk and fusion with folb is found in bifidobacterium longum. the sequenced chlamydiae all lack homologs of folc but have folpk homologs , making folc a locally missing gene in this group. inspection revealed that a member of gene family cog <dig> is clustered in chlamydiae with folate biosynthesis genes . this cog <dig> family contains the f420:γ-glutamyl ligase cofe of archaea and mycobacteria <cit> . cofe catalyzes the gtp-dependent successive addition of two γ-linked l-glutamates to the l-lactyl phosphodiester of <dig> -didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin , a reaction analogous to that mediated by folc. chlamydiae almost certainly do not make f <dig> since they lack all the other known cof genes <cit> . we accordingly predicted that the cofe homolog in chlamydiae has folc activity. a cofe homolog was shown to complement the methionine and glycine requirements of the e. coli folc mutant sf <dig> <cit> indicating that ct <dig> can indeed functionally replace folc . the e. coli folc gene from the aska collection <cit> was used as a positive control. the paba branch we adopted the nomenclature of xie et al. <cit> for the paba branch genes. these genes are hard to annotate for several reasons. in the first place, they can be fused in various combinations. a fusion between the subunits of adc synthase is a common arrangement, as is fusion between pabaa and adc lyase . in one genome, corynebacterium diphtheriae, our analysis indicated a triple fusion. the functions of this pabaa-pabab-pabac fusion gene were tested experimentally. the gene was cloned into an expression vector and introduced into an e. coli pabaa pabab mutant , which cannot grow on minimal medium unless it expresses a recombinant enzyme with adc synthase activity. a bifunctional pabaa-pabab adc synthase protein from arabidopsis served as a positive control. like the positive control, expression of the dip <dig> protein restored paba prototrophy . this result shows that the dip <dig> protein has adc synthase activity but does not demonstrate adc lyase activity because the bn <dig> strain has endogenous adc lyase . enzyme assays were therefore used to test dip <dig> for adc lyase activity. bn <dig> cultures harboring plasmids encoding dip <dig> arabidopsis adc synthase, and e. coli pabac were grown and induced, and proteins were extracted. extracts of cells expressing dip <dig> were incubated with chorismate and glutamine, without or with e. coli pabac; paba was formed in the absence of pabac whereas, as expected, arabidopsis pabaa-pabab formed paba only if pabac was added. reaction rates were: dip <dig> – pabac, <dig> ; dip <dig> + pabac, <dig> ; arabidopsis adcs – pabac, < <dig> ; arabidopsis adcs + pabac, <dig> . these data establish that dip <dig> has adc lyase as well as adc synthase activity. another difficulty in annotating the pabaabc genes is that most organisms contain paralogs of pabaa and pabab that participate in tryptophan biosynthesis <cit> , and in some cases the pabab subunit is shared between the paba and tryptophan pathways <cit> . finally, pabac belongs to the large branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase family and is hard to distinguish from these enzymes. these problems mean that the current seed annotation of the paba branch of folate synthesis should be taken as tentative. that said, analysis of the distribution of these genes reveals that most bacteria make paba from chorismate. as expected, many intracellular bacteria lack all paba genes. in cases where the organisms have the pterin branch but lack all enzymes of the paba branch, annotation problems cannot be ruled out but an alternative pathway for the biosynthesis of paba, starting for example with dehydroquinate instead of chorismate, could also be the answer <cit> . pterin salvage the leishmania pterin reductase ptr <dig> is a member of the sdr family, but has a highly characteristic motif tgx3rxg <cit> . this motif is shared with e. coli folm and similar sdr family proteins in a variety of bacterial taxa. several of the folm-like genes are clustered with genes of the pterin branch of folate synthesis , suggesting a function in folate or pterin synthesis since e. coli <cit> and other bacteria <cit> are known to contain tetrahydromonapterin or other tetrahydropterins that could serve as cofactors for pterin-dependent enzymes, we predict that folm-like genes are not primarily involved in folate synthesis but rather are pteridine reductases that, like ptr <dig> produce and/or reduce <dig> -dihydropterins. consistent with this prediction, the recombinant folm protein catalyzes reduction of dihydrobiopterin to the tetrahydro form; unlike ptr <dig> however, it does not mediate reduction of fully oxidized biopterin to the dihydro form <cit> . supporting the latter observation, we found that an e. coli gchy-i mutant can use the dihydro but not the oxidized forms of neopterin, monapterin, or 6-hydroxymethylpterin to support folate synthesis <cit> . futhermore, expression of a typical folm-like gene from a plasmid did not enable this mutant to use oxidized pterins, indicating that – like folm – the pd <dig> gene product does not act on oxidized pterins . in control experiments in which leishmania ptr <dig> was expressed from a plasmid, the mutant was able to use oxidized pterins, confirming that it is oxidized pterin reduction that is lacking in e. coli <cit> . searching the arabidopsis genome revealed some <dig> members of the sdr family, of which none had the tgx3rxg motif. this led to the prediction that arabidopsis would be unable to salvage oxidized pterins, which was verified by showing that 6-hydroxymethylpterin was not reduced in vivo or in vitro, and was not incorporated into folates <cit> . CONCLUSIONS this analysis and integration study demonstrates that simple phylogenomic analysis of a biochemical pathway – even a well-known one – can unearth globally missing or locally missing genes in bacteria and plants and reveals that many open questions remain . it can also identify, or suggest functions for, additional genes related to the pathway . such analysis can thus lead to discovery of potential new drug or herbicide targets such as gchy-ib, which occurs in many pathogenic bacteria but not in mammals, or the chloroplast folate carrier that is likewise absent from mammals. it should be noted that content of the current seed folate subsystem captures the present status of an ongoing annotation effort, that the content will be refined and improved as more bacterial and plant genomes are added, and that further predictions are expected to emerge. finally, we emphasize that the predictions herein are offered with the hope that others will find them useful in their own research.",

clock system in most organisms. these biological timekeepers permit organisms to maintain near <dig> h rhythms in most physiological processes and anticipate periodic changes in their environments. in mammals, the circadian system consists of a master circadian timekeeper in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus <cit> and several slave timekeepers distributed in multiple tissues throughout the body, such as the liver, lungs and kidney <cit> . nevertheless, there is a common underlying mechanism producing circadian rhythms in these tissues based on transcriptional-translational feedback loops <cit> . in the ttfl, the protein products of several genes inhibits their own transcription after associated delays due to transcription, translation and post-translational modification. after the identification of the scn master clock <cit> , the first component of the ttfl was identified as the gene clock <cit> . subsequently, other “core” members of the ttfl, such as the repressors period and cryptochrome , activators arntl and npas <dig> and nuclear receptors rev-erb and ror were established. there has been continued interest in finding new members of the ttfl not only for better understanding the mammalian circadian clock, but also because mutations in these core genes have been linked to several disorders <cit> . while clock was discovered by costly and laborious forward genetic screens by joseph takahashi and colleagues <cit> , current high-throughput data from genetics, transcriptomics and proteomics and availability of the entire genome combined with system biological approaches have tremendously accelerated our ability to find new putative members of the ttfl <cit> . recently, anafi et al. used probabilistic machine learning to identify a putative clock member and subsequently experimentally verified it to discover the novel clock gene chrono <cit> . similar bioinformatic approaches were used to identify novel circadian genes from microarray data <cit> and using co-expression data and text-mining <cit> , to find circadian genes disrupted in cancer cell lines <cit> and to find health implications of disrupted clock genes <cit> . in this work, we aim to filter the list of a <dig> putative clock genes from <cit> to determine the strongest candidates for further experimental validation. we do this by including other sources of high-throughput data, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing , proteomic and protein-protein interaction data, not included in the original machine-learning procedure of <cit> . we combined metrics for different data sources using a simple scoring scheme and shortlisted p <dig> cytochrome oxidoreductase , metastasis suppressor <dig> , proviral integration site <dig> , diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase <dig> , protein phosphatase <dig> regulatory sub-unit 3b and uridine phosphorylase <dig> . method we started our meta-analysis from the list of <dig> putative clock genes identified by anafi et al. , henceforth referred to as the ‘master list’. anafi and colleagues compiled this master list by combining bayesian scores representing five features necessary in a clock gene: oscillating transcripts in liver, pituitary and nih3t <dig> cells; a circadian phenotype in response to rna interference of the gene; significant number of functional genetic interactions with an exemplar list of known “core” clock genes based on radiation hybrid mapping; ubiquity of expression of the gene across multiple tissues based on expressed sequence tags ; phylogenic conservation across fruit flies and mammals. we exploit the wealth of available high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data on the circadian system not used by anafi et al. to further screen the master list for putative clock genes that are most worthy of experimental validation. we restricted our attention to data on mice , since circadian data sets are overwhelmingly based on the mouse model and therefore several time-resolved high quality circadian data sets are available . however, we included data from all mammals in the non-circadian ppi data sets. our data set selection criteria was to include all chip-seq data on circadian tfs, circadian proteomics data and ppi data on mice that was available when this meta-analysis was conducted. the source of the published data, the characterized protein or transcription factor, the total number of binding sites for the chip-seq data and the number of genes corresponding to the quantified proteins in the case of proteomics or protein-protein interaction data are provided. when data could be filtered to include only circadian components, the number of genes with circadian chip-seq or proteomic evidence is also listed. finally, the total number of hits from each data set among the <dig> gene long master list is given. the statistically overrepresented circadian hits are marked by significance ∗:p< <dig> ,∗∗:p< <dig> ,∗∗∗:p< <dig> ,ns:not significant chip-seq data the rhythm generation in the circadian clock is a result of a ttfl, as described earlier. within the ttfl, clock genes acting as transcription factors mutually regulate each other. thus, it is likely that putative clock genes are transcriptionally regulated by known clock transcription factors , such as bmal <dig> clock, npas <dig> e4bp <dig> ror α, rev-erb α and rev-erb β. therefore, we searched for chip-seq binding sites for each clock tf in the vicinity of the genes in the master list. moreover, when time-resolved binding of the tf factor was measured in a study, we restricted our attention further to only those chip-seq binding sites that show circadian binding of the tf. koike et al. <cit> provide time-resolved genome-wide chip-seq binding sampled every four hours over one day in mouse liver for the tfs bmal <dig> clock, npas, cry <dig> cry <dig> per <dig> and per <dig> . it is worth noting that pers and crys do not possess dna binding domains, but we still retain the data as we believe that they might represent regulation by a complex composed of these important circadian proteins. we used the false discovery rates for circadian binding from the original study to filter genes with circadian tf binding using a cutoff of <dig> . rey et al. <cit> similarly performed a detailed study of the genome-wide binding of activator bmal <dig> in the mouse liver sampled every four hours over one day . as before, we restricted our choice to gene with circadian bmal <dig> binding with a fdr< <dig> , based on a fisher test for periodicity as suggested by the authors of the study. cho et al. <cit> compared the cistromes of both isoforms of the nuclear receptor repressor rev-erb at a single time point 8) and against the cistrome of bmal <dig> the raw chip-seq was processed using the tftargetcaller package in r <cit> to produce an annotated list of chip-seq peaks. although they discovered significant overlap between the binding sites of both isoforms, we retained the genes proximal to binding sites of each isoform, separately. bugge et al. <cit> and feng et al. <cit> , in related studies, investigated the role of nuclear-receptor repressors rev-erb α and rev-erb β in metabolism in the liver. they measured binding using chip-seq of both tfs at two time points, <dig> hours apart. as before, we processed the raw chip-seq data using the tftargetcaller package in r <cit> to produce an annotated list of chip-seq peaks. since circadian binding cannot be reliably determined from two time points, we pooled binding sites from both time points for both tfs. fang et al. <cit> , recently, measured binding of the d-box repressor e4bp <dig> and nuclear receptor activator in the mouse liver at zt <dig> as part of a study on identifying functional circadian chip-seq binding sites. we processed their raw data using homer <cit> for peak-calling and assigning peaks to the nearest gene. proteomics data a common feature of clock genes is that they are cycling both at the transcript as well as the protein level. the circadian nature of the former is already included in compiling the master list. subsequently, three studies of the circadian proteome were published and we use them as another source of data for screening. robles et al. <cit> quantified the circadian proteome in the liver sampled at <dig> time-points over two days under light-dark conditions. they used a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture combined with mass spectrometry to find oscillating proteins. we included all genes whose proteins were determined to have significant oscillations with a <dig> fdr cut-off in the original study . mauvoisin et al. <cit> performed a similar study of the liver proteome under light-dark conditions also using the silac-ms approach. with <dig> samples over two days, we selected those gene whose proteins were deemed circadian with an fdr of <dig> according to the analysis in the study . chiang et al. <cit> , on the other hand, quantified the mouse scn proteome sampled at six time points over one day using silac combined a slightly different ms approach. the genes with time-of-day variation in protein concentration were selected using a <dig> fdr cut-off . it is interesting to note that none of the proteomics studies identified as circadian the core circadian proteins, such as the pers and crys, since their levels were too low to be detected using current techniques. protein-protein interaction data for a gene to be an integral part of the ttfl, it might interact at the protein level with known clock members. therefore, we complemented the gene interaction study used by anafi et al. with publicly available protein-protein interaction data. in particular, we searched for protein interactions with a list of <dig> core circadian genes gathered by wallach et al. <cit> . note that this list of core circadian genes is longer than the exemplar list of <dig> used by anafi et al. <cit> . wallach et al. <cit> compiled the list of all proteins interacting with the <dig> core circadian genes from the unified human interactome database <cit> that was mined from <dig> different sources using four different approaches. we looked for evidence of interactions between genes in the master list and these <dig> core clock genes . from the protein interaction network analysis database , we were able to obtain complementary data on interactions identified in m. musculus alone that is similarly drawn from multiple public resources. as before, genes in the master list with at least one interaction with the <dig> core clock genes were sought in the pina database. combining the sources and scoring we drew our data from multiple sources that are generated using different techniques, as described above, which makes integrating them a non-trivial task. it is particularly difficult to assign confidences to these different measurements. we therefore resorted to a very simple scoring scheme where the presence of a gene in a particular data set gets a score of one and its absence, a score of zero, otherwise. thus, we give equal weight to a data set, whether chip-seq, proteomic or ppi. the only exception to this weighting rule is the data set from rey et al. <cit> , which is given a weight of three, since it is a particularly detailed and thorough study of a central transcription factor . whenever time-resolved data were available, we restricted our attention to binding, concentrations or interactions that were identified to be circadian at the appropriate statistical level . we mapped all protein data back to coding gene and assigned chip-seq peaks to the nearest gene, and used the entrez gene id as the common unified index for each gene ). the final score for each gene in the master list was computed as the sum of gene score within each constituent data set and reflects simply the number of studies that provide evidence supporting the circadian nature of that gene. a gene under this scheme can receive a maximum score of <dig> we were able to attach a p-value to the total score for each gene using the following randomized shuffling procedure. we assigned the total number of hits obtained from each data set randomly to genes in the master list. iterating this procedure, we produced an empirical distribution of scores and the probability of achieving a more extreme total score can be thus computed. selecting genes robust to the choice of weighting scheme we used a simple binary scoring scheme for each gene within a data set that resulted in a much heigher weight being assigned to the chip-seq data compared to the other two. we therefore tested if genes were particulary sensitive to the relative choice of weights for the different types of data sets. we therefore introduced pre-factors for each class of data: α for chip-seq, β for proteomic, and γ for protein-protein interaction , respectively. then, the total score for a gene g for this choice of pre-factors is s=α+β+γ=α∑chip-seqdataiii+β∑proteomicsdatajij+γ∑ppi datakik, where il is one, if the gene g is present in a data set l, zero if it is not. we further fix α+β+γ= <dig> our original scoring described above and in additional file <dig> is equivalent to a choice of equal pre-factors for all three classes, i.e., α=β=γ= <dig> we then altered each pre-factor randomly while restricting changes to at most <dig> % above or below the original equal pre-factors. in other words, we generate random , such that <dig> <α,β,γ< <dig> . care was taken while generating these random pre-factors to ensure that the pre-factors were truly uniformly distributed over the simplex. finally, for each random choice of pre-factors, we computed a background distribution of scores s using the randomized shuffling procedure while keeping the fixed. significant candidate genes for that particular choice of pre-factors were those genes with a p-value < <dig> . finally, we retained only genes that were found to be significant in each of <dig> random choices of . this list of genes was thus robust to variations in the choice of pre-factors and are listed in fig. <dig> fig. <dig> data mining approach to find novel clock candidate genes. the schematic outlines the approach along with the types of data sources used to filter the master list of <dig> genes from anafi et al. <cit> to the list of <dig> novel candidate clock genes. some key properties of the novel candidates genes are also indicated. the entire list of robust and non-robust candidate genes are given in table s <dig> in additional file 2 model of phase regulation of genes by combinations of transcription factors we processed the mrna transcript time series data from <cit> using jtkcycle <cit> to obtain phases of master list genes. we then grouped the chip-seq data sets into e-box activators , d-box repressor , and rre regulators . we used the chip-seq components in the table of scores to construct scores for each tf group regulating a gene by summing all chip-seq scores for that tf group in the table of scores and normalizing each score by the maximum score attainable within that tf group. each gene was thus associated with three scores, se, sd and srre, for the e-box, d-box and rre tf groups, respectively, that all take values between zero and one. we fit a type of generalized linear model for the phase of gene transcripts with the three scores as predictors. since transcript phase is a circular dependent variable , we needed a link function to relate the linear predictor based on the three scores to the transcript phase. the circular variable is assumed to have a von mises distribution whose mean is linked to the linear regressors via an ‘arctan’ link function as suggested in <cit> : e=μ+2arctancese+cdsd+crresrre, where ϕgene is the wrapped gene phase in ct and the model parameters include the unregulated mean phase μ of the genes and the contributions of the three scores to the linear regressor . the concentration parameter of the von mises distribution κ is assumed to be constant and independent of the tf scores and is also estimated . the glm was fit using iteratively-weighted least squares implemented in the circular package in r. RESULTS candidate genes identified by the meta-analysis the meta-analysis approach outlined in fig. <dig> yielded a table of scores for the <dig> genes in the master list , which is one of the primary results of this work. the chip-seq data sets contributed the largest number of hits to the master list and hence, was the largest contributor to the total score . the proteomic and ppi data sets had limited effect on the total score. based on the chip-seq data sets, genes in the master list were mostly bound by transcription factors via rre and to a lesser extent at e-boxes and d-boxes . it must be noted, that the e-box binding tfs satisfied the stringent criteria of binding chromatin in a circadian manner, while the rest were based on experiments performed at one or two circadian phases. we tested whether the presence of a gene in any of the data sets assembled in this study is predictive of high ranks in the original evidence factor-based ranking of anafi et al. <cit> . interestingly, presence of circadian bmal <dig> binding <cit> , or circadian proteome according to <cit> , or identified ppis with any clock protein in mouse or humans were all significantly predictive of high ranks. overall, we found a significant but weak positive association between the original ranking and a ranking based on our score . thus, the data sets incorporated in this work are broadly consistent with the master list from <cit> . thirty-one genes in the master list obtained statistically significant total scores based on the randomized shuffling procedure, where a total score of <dig> was significant at the <dig> level . we used this rather stringent threshold to compensate for the inherent correlation in the scores between data sets that is unaccounted for in the shuffling procedure. our simple scoring of genes results in chip-seq data sets contributing the most to the total score of each gene, as described above. we therefore compensated for this effect by pruning out genes from the list of <dig> statistically significant scoring genes that were not robust to the choice of relative weights for the chip-seq, proteomic and ppi data sets . after pruning, we were left with <dig> robust candidate clock-associated genes that included nine known clock-associated genes. in fact, all the known clock-associated genes in the list of significant scorers were robust to the weighting scheme. further, our candidate list contained <dig> out of <dig> ‘core’ clock genes defined by ueda and colleagues <cit> . among the <dig> novel robust candidate genes, all except tomm <dig> had a rhythmic transcript in at least one tissue <cit> and five genes had a significantly rhythmic protein product in at least one of the three proteomic studies . in line with the overall trends identified earlier, most novel genes were predominated by chip-seq binding of clock tfs with little evidence in the proteomic or ppi studies. moreover, <dig> of the <dig> robust candidate genes featured in the top <dig> ‘circadian’ genes in <cit> including six known clock genes . the novel robust candidates in the top <dig> were por, azin <dig> and gys <dig> curiously, we observed a bimodal distribution of evidence-based ranks among these <dig> robust candidates , with genes falling in the top or bottom of the anafi et al. list. lima <dig> fam20a and ppp1r3b constitute robust candidates that were indeed ranked in the bottom <dig> where our meta-analysis adds novelty to the candidate list. fig. <dig> scores of the significant and robust candidate genes and their relationship to the

evidence-based ranks from anafi et al. <cit> for the <dig> significant and robust candidate genes identified in a. the candidate genes that obtained evidence-based ranks in the top and bottom <dig> are also listed motivated by the close association between the circadian clock and metabolism, we checked if candidate gene products catalyzed metabolic reactions using the kegg database <cit> . por, gne, upp <dig> gys <dig> and etnk <dig> were robust candidate genes with enzymatic functions, while dgat <dig> pik3r <dig> and chka were significantly high-scoring, but non-robust, genes with a metabolic role. however, only upp <dig> and gys <dig> were directly involved in catalyzing reactions with at least one substrate with circadian variation in abundance in the mouse liver <cit> . however, no substrate of candidate genes were circadian in the human metabolome in the saliva <cit> . candidate gene transcripts in different tissues we next compared our meta-analysis to the recently published high-resolution micro-array and rna-sequencing study of the circadian transcriptome in <dig> tissues <cit> . recall that the original master list was compiled using an earlier microarray circadian transcriptome study in just three tissues <cit> and with the intention of finding genes with ubiquitously circadian transcripts. therefore, it was surprising to find that only <dig> out of the <dig> master list genes had a circadian transcript in at least one tissue in <cit> . nevertheless, the total score was reasonably correlated with the number of tissues in which the gene transcript was significantly circadian , even with the simple scoring methodology used here. when we considered individual components of the score, we found that e-box binding, circadian protein expression and ppi with clock genes to be the most significant predictors of genes transcribed in a circadian manner in multiple tissues , though rre binding also played a, albeit less significant, role . moreover, bmal <dig> and rev-erb α,β appeared to be the main e-box and rre transcription factors, respectively, responsible for driving oscillations in many tissues. the <dig> robust candidate genes were significantly over-representative of genes that were circadian in many tissues . more than <dig> % of the candidate genes were expressed in a circadian manner in at least four tissues, while this reduces to <dig> % among the low-scoring non-robust non-significant genes . in addition, when robust candidate genes were sorted in descending order of the number of tissues in which they showed circadian transcripts, eight of the nine known clock-associated genes were at the top of this list. interestingly, significantly high-scoring non-robust genes were also generally expressed in many tissues and exhibited similar properties to the robust candidates . fig. <dig> transcript expression of candidate genes. a the distributions of the number of different tissues and expression phase in those tissues compared across candidate genes and the rest of the master list based on <cit> . b the circadian expression profiles in fourteen different tissues of genes in the candidate list that were expressed in a circadian manner in at least four tissues when we consider the regulated phases of only significant circadian transcripts , we noticed that genes in the master list were expressed uniformly throughout the day with a slight bias towards ct23-ct24/ <dig> . however, transcript phases of robust candidate genes were strongly concentrated around ct9- <dig> . remarkably, the circadian transcripts of candidate genes in different tissues shared the same phase of peak expression with very few exceptions. in fact, candidate genes that were circadian in at least five tissues showed a very high degree of expression phase coherence . the exceptions were mostly genes expressed in four or fewer tissues, such as chka and mtss <dig> for example, mtss <dig> and chka showed distinctly different phase of expression in the heart as compared to the other three tissues in which they were expressed in a circadian manner . regulation of master list genes by circadian transcription factors in the mammalian transcriptome, few circadian tfs appear to regulate many circadian transcripts with a wide variety of expression phases throughout the circadian cycle . one hypothesis of circadian phase regulation is that different circadian genes are regulated by different subsets of tfs. this results in different phases of expression of the regulated genes, since each circadian tf has its peak expression at a different time of day . we examined this hypothesis of whether binding of certain tfs was indicative of phase-specific transcript regulation using the chip-seq data on different circadian tfs and the transcript phase of master list genes. in particular, we assumed in this analysis that chip-seq binding of tfs in the mouse liver is highly representative of binding of those tfs in other tissues. this allowed us to pool circadian phases of significant transcripts from all <dig> tissues <cit> in order to get sufficient sample sizes in each combination of tfs. we grouped the chip data sets into e-box activators , d-box repressor , and rre regulators . we were able to combine rre activator and repressors, since the rre activators and repressors were expressed <dig> h apart . in other words, the peak of the rre activator and nadir of the rre repressor occur approximately simultaneously and vice-versa, thus, making their effects on gene transcription similar. based on this classification, we expect activation via each regulator group to peak when the corresponding tf peaks . we first qualitatively compared the presence or absence of these regulatory features of genes against the phase distribution of the transcripts . transcripts regulated by only e-box elements were likely to peak around dusk , while only rre regulated transcripts peaked commonly around dawn . for reference, rev-erbβ is a typical e-box gene that peaks at c <dig> and bmal <dig> is a typical rre regulated gene that peaks at ct <dig> genes in this list regulated by both elements showed a spread of transcripts phases throughout the day with a bias towards dusk-phased e-box genes. few genes in the master list were regulated either by d-boxes alone or by a combination of e- and d-boxes and hence, no conclusions could be drawn on them. the confluence of repression by a dusk-phased d-box regulator and rre regulators produced an even stronger peak of expression at ct22- <dig> finally, regulation by all three groups of tfs produced two equally strong peaks of expression at dawn and dusk. fig. <dig> phase regulation of circadian transcripts. a the distribution of the expression phase of genes that are significantly circadian in different tissues <cit> classified according to the combinations of transcription factors binding their promoter based on chip-seq data. e-box: bmal <dig> or npas <dig> or clock, d-box: e4bp <dig> rre: rev-erb α or rev-erb β or ror α. the grey vertical lines represent the median phase of expression within each group of transcripts and the line width increases with increasing significance of the mean-direction . the number of transcripts in each group is also provided. b the estimated distribution of phases for each combination of tfs from the generalized linear model fit of the transcript phases to the normalized scores for each tf group within the chip-seq data in our meta-analysis. under the model, the phase of expression within each group is assumed to follow a von mises distribution, whose mean is linearly dependent on the normalized scores we computed normalized scores for the regulation of each gene by the different tf groups based on the chip-seq data and then a regression between the expression phase of the gene against a linear combination of the scores . we assumed that genes with higher scores, i.e., more consensus within the chip-seq data sets for a tf, also have higher affinity for the particular tf. the fitted model of phase regulation was as follows: mean gene phase = <dig> +2arctan− <dig> se+ <dig> sd+ <dig> srre, where se,sd,srre are the chip-seq scores for e-box, d-box and rre regulators respectively. the model parameter estimates were significant at the <dig> level and the concentration parameter of the phase distribution was estimated to be <dig> . the predicted phase distribution for genes regulated by different combination of tfs from the fitted model in is shown in fig. 4b. the model fits are consistent with the qualitative observations in fig. 4a. the model eq. <dig> reveals that the mean expression of genes unregulated by these tfs in the master list is ct <dig> genes with higher e-box scores progressively decrease the gene phase from ct <dig> i.e., move them towards dusk. on the other hand, d-box and rre regulation increase the gene phase from ct <dig> i.e., move them towards dawn. however, e-box scores have a larger effect on phase than d-box and rre scores. finally, the model can be used to predict the phase of expression for other genes, if chip-seq data are available to estimate their scores. discussion we presented in this paper a meta-analysis , where we integrated circadian chip-seq, proteomics and protein-protein interaction data with the recently published machine learning-based selection of putative circadian genes from transcriptomic data, small interference rna screens and genomic conservation data <cit> . our goal was to screen for novel candidate genes bioinformatically using publicly available data sources. this analysis produced a table of scores for the <dig> potential circadian genes from <cit> . interestingly, we found no strong correlation between our ranking based on gene scores and the ranking of anafi et al., suggesting that two sets of sources provide complementary insights into the circadian nature of the genes. the anafi et al. ranking reflects mainly transcriptional rhythmicity and as such the chip-seq data would be expected to be consistent with it, since they relate to the same process of transcription. however, binding to the chromatin is not always functional and unless the activity of the tf is also circadian, binding of circadian tfs does not necessitate circadian transcription. this nevertheless represents an inherent limitation of chip-seq data and is a caveat to our entire study. on the other hand, proteomics and ppi are truly independent data sources, since they represent altogether different cellular processes from transcription. we therefore expect that our three data sources do provide new information as compared to <cit> to further filter these genes. the chip-seq data consisted of the largest number of different sources and predictably had the strongest influence on the scores. the three categories of tfs, e-box binding, rre binding and d-box binding were all individually influential and gave hits in the master list . although there were few genes in the master list with a circadian protein expression, they were significantly over-represented in the master list. this can be attributed to the few circadian proteins identified overall in those studies <cit> , where low concentrations make quantification of most known core circadian genes difficult. the ppi with known core clock genes also provided sparse hits within the <dig> master list genes. nevertheless, hits from ppi, bmal <dig> and rev-erb α,β chip-seq and circadian proteomics data sets were predictive of both original evidence-based ranking and rhythmic transcriptome in the mouse liver, pituitary and nih3t <dig> cells as quantified by <cit> . thus, despite the low correlation between scoring methodologies alluded to earlier, the newly integrated data appear to be consistent with the original data sources. we verified our approach against the recently published rna-sequencing study on the circadian transcriptome in multiple tissues <cit> , which was not used in our study. surprisingly, only about <dig> % of genes in the master list were circadian in at least one of fourteen tissues. nevertheless, we found that high gene scores in our meta-analysis was indicative of robust circadian transcripts in multiple tissues. this supports the ability of our analysis methodology to find potential clock-associated genes, since we expect candidate clock genes to be ubiquitously circadian. consistent with conclusions based on data of <cit> , we found bmal <dig> and rev-erb α,β were predictive of circadian rhythms in multiple tissues along with interaction with known circadian proteins and oscillating protein expression. this suggests that e-boxes and rre repressors might be major drivers of the circadian transcriptome in multiple tissues. we therefore compared the phases of the robust circadian transcriptome in multiple tissues in <cit> against the analyzed chip-seq data for e-box activators, d-box repressor and rre regulators in order to check for characteristic patterns of phase regulation by these tfs. one remarkable feature was that the transcript phase for at least the master list genes were quite consistent across <dig> tissues. consistent with expectations, we found that genes with only rre binding were likely to peak around dawn , whereas e-box only bound genes were likely to peak at around dusk . those genes with binding at both e-boxes and rres showed a mixture of phases between dawn and dusk. moreover, we observed that the d-box repressor regulated most master list genes only in conjunction with rres, where they enhanced dawn-phase expression, since the effect of both regulators were in-phase. indeed, fang et al. <cit> showed that this d-box repressor works downstream of rev-erb α,β. the presence of all three regulator types produces both dawn and dusk-phase expression. the amount of consensus between the different chip-seq sources in our meta-analysis was used to measure the affinity of tfs to particular genes as a score. the e-boxes, d-boxes and rres scores for each gene were then used as predictors of the expression phase of the gene via a model. this model provided a statistically significant fit to the data and described how the presence of the different tfs quantitatively tuned the expression phase of a gene . it must be borne in mind that for this analysis of phase regulation, we pooled all the transcript phases and assumed that chip-seq binding in the liver implies similar binding in all tissues. moreover, since the master list was itself obtained from a machine-learning-based search for novel clock genes <cit> , this list might not be representative of the entire circadian transcriptome. we found <dig> candidate genes with highly significant scores in our meta-analysis that were also robust to the choice of relative weights for the chip-seq, proteomics and ppi data. nine known clock-associated genes were included in these <dig> genes, serving as a sanity-check for our approach. although there were abundant chip-seq hits among these robust candidate genes, the few ppi hits were present only for known clock genes and circadian protein expression was restricted to por, gne, mtss <dig> upp <dig> and ppp1r3b. the intersection of the top <dig> genes in <cit> and these candidate genes yielded four novel genes: por, azin <dig> and gys <dig> most known clock-associated robust candidates received high ranks in <cit> , while others that received quite low ranks were the truly novel candidates identified in this study, such as mtss <dig> and ppp1r3b . several novel robust candidate genes had protein products that had an enzymatic role in metabolism. this is not unexpected as most of the data used in our meta-analysis were gathered from the liver, which is known to have a very important role in metabolism. however, only upp <dig> and gys <dig> catalyzed reactions with a substrate with circadian variation in abundance in the mouse liver <cit> and none of the substrates were circadian in humans <cit> . these <dig> robust candidate genes were also statistically expressed in more number of tissues than other master list genes based on circadian transcriptomics data <cit> . since known clock genes are generally expressed in many tissues, this is indeed a desirable feature for candidate clock-associated genes. in addition to the remarkable consistency of expression phases of gene transcripts in tissues in which they are significantly circadian, transcripts of candidate genes were enriched for peaks at dusk suggestive of e-box regulation. the similarity in the phase of candidate genes across tissues sets them apart from circadian output genes that are suggested to be regulated in a tissue-specific manner <cit> . we next discuss specific candidate genes that might be the most rewarding to be studied experimentally based on a combination of factors including circadian protein expression, number of tissues in which their transcript is circadian and their robustness to the choice of weights for the different data classes . nadph-cytochrome p <dig> oxidoreductase had a rhythmic transcript in nine tissues with an average phase of ct <dig> and was the only gene in our candidate gene list with a circadian protein concentration in both liver proteomic data sets. por is a flavoprotein responsible for electron transfer from nadph to all p <dig> enzymes in microsomes. while por knockout in mice is embryonic lethal <cit> , conditional knockout of por in the liver affects lipid metabolism and homeostatis and results in hepatic lipidosis <cit> . recently, johnson et al. <cit> showed that ablation of the liver circadian clock affects the levels of por expression, protein and activity, which in turn likely plays in role in regulating hepatotoxicity caused by acetaminophen. based on the analysis of the chip-seq data, the por promoter is bound by three types of clock tfs, e-box regulators , rre regulators and d-box repressor . metastasis supressor <dig> was expressed in a circadian manner in four tissues with an average phase of ct <dig> and cycling protein levels in one liver study <cit> . mtss <dig> was identified as a potential tumor suppressor as it was not expressed in human bladder cancer cell lines <cit> and involved in signaling in other carcinomas. it also plays a role in cytoskeleton dynamics by interacting with actin filaments <cit> . since it is strongly expressed in the liver, mtss <dig> was identified as circadian gene with different phase of expression in rats and mice based on early microarray transcriptomic studies <cit> . moreover, mtss <dig> was only candidate gene that displayed significantly different phase of expression between tissues. while the mtss <dig> gene promoter certainly binds e-box regulators , rre activator and d-box repressor , the evidence of regulation by the rre repressors was mixed between two studies <cit> . another oncogene, proviral integration site <dig> pim <dig> was expressed with consistent phase across six tissues without being detected in either proteomic study. pim <dig> encodes a kinase that is upregulated in many cancer cell lines <cit> and downregulation of pim <dig> retarted cell proliferation in human hepatoma cell lines <cit> . further, pim <dig> appears to play a role in glucose homeostatis by downregulating insulin-secretion in response to glucose, thus making pim3−/− mice tolerant to glucose in vivo. in the circadian context, pim <dig> was identified as a light-induced immediate-early gene in the scn <cit> making it important also in the function of master circadian clock consistent with the bioinformatic prediction that pim <dig> has a conserved cre element its promoter <cit> . the promoter of pim <dig> binds d-box repressor and the rre-regulators , but there is inconsistency in the binding of e-box tf between the two studies. diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase <dig> dgat <dig> did not exhibit any cycling in protein levels, but showed transcript oscillations with an average phase of ct <dig> in six tissues. dgat <dig> is responsible for the synthesis of triglycerides from diacylglycerol. moreover, dgat <dig> is directly regulated by the cardiomyocyte circadian clock and participates in the response of the heart to fatty acids <cit> . the e-box activators and rre repressors , but not the d-box repressor or rre activator , bind the dgat <dig> promoter. the choice of dgat <dig> is also supported by an independent rnai study <cit> performed by maier and colleagues , where a significant one hour period lengthening was observed in u2os cells in response to the gene knockdown. this rnai phenotype led to the choice of dgat <dig> although it was not robust to the choice of weighting scheme . next, we consider a protein phosphatase regulatory subunit 3b of pp <dig> ppp1r3b that was a robust candidate gene. pp1r3b suppresses the glycogen phosphorylase activity of pp <dig> and enhanced its glycogen synthase activity. although ppp1r3b was expressed in a circadian manner in fewer tissues than the previous four genes, the knockdown of the gene displayed a significant long period phenotype in an independent rnai study <cit> on human u2os cells. pp <dig> a known clock component <cit> , affects the period of the mammalian circadian clock <cit> and is known to target per <dig> <cit> . nevertheless, none of the catalytic subunits of pp <dig> is transcriptionally circadian in any tissue. this might indeed be novel layer of the clock regulation by pp <dig> by means of a circadian regulatory subunit ppp1r3b. finally, uridine phosphorylase <dig> was a robust candidate gene in our meta-analysis. upp <dig> is a particularly interesting candidate, since it is an example of a circadian protein that is also a metabolic enzyme. eckel-mahan et al. <cit> showed that upp <dig> acted on two circadian metabolites and thus is one of the few known common nodes between circadian transcriptome and circadian metabolome <cit> . while upp <dig> has been shown to be a clock output gene in the liver <cit> , our meta-analysis revealed that upp <dig> was robustly circadian in the kidney too with the same phase as in the liver . interestingly, in humans, upp <dig> is expressed more in the kidney than in the liver <cit> . therefore, it might be interesting to study the circadian role of upp <dig> further, in addition to the known metabolic context in the liver. CONCLUSIONS we combined multiple high-throughput public data sources of circadian data to filter the shortlist of <dig> potential circadian genes from <cit> to obtain <dig> novel robust candidate genes. in particular, we suggested por, mtss <dig> pim <dig> dgat <dig> ppp1r3b and upp <dig> for further experimental studies as potential clock genes. these genes appear to have a role in either metabolism or cancer or stress response making them a potential link between the circadian clock and these physiological processes. we also showed from the different chip-seq data that phase regulation of transcription of circadian genes is driven by specific transcription factors in a combinatorial manner consistent across multiple tissues. although we focused our discussion on the significant candidate genes, we have assigned scores based on our analysis for the all <dig> shortlisted genes that can serve as a starting point to integrate additional data sources as they or tools to integrate them become available. in order to keep the scoring in the meta-analysis simple we used binary scoring of hits from various data sources. a bayesian analysis might be performed in order to consistently combine final scores from <cit> for a better consolidated final ranking. meta-analyses of the ever growing publicly available data targeted at different aspects of the regulatory network has the potential to aid functional network discovery in the circadian and other contexts and utilize these data to their fullest potential. availability of data and materials the data sets supporting the results of this article are listed in additional file <dig> additional files additional file <dig> complete score table from the meta-analysis for all the <dig> master list genes with individual hits of a gene within each data set. additional file <dig> supplementary tables. table s <dig> list of core circadian genes according to anafi et al. <cit> , wallach et al. <cit> and ukai and ueda <cit> in the master list of <dig> genes and their scores based on our meta-analysis. the shaded genes were found among the <dig> candidate genes by our meta-analysis. table s <dig> list of candidate genes robust to choice of weighting scheme. table s <dig> highly significant candidate clock associated genes with the number tissues in which they are known to be expressed in a circadian manner. table s <dig> peak protein expression phase of different circadian transcription factors. additional file <dig> supplementary figures. figure s <dig> the distribution of promoter elements among the master list genes. figure s <dig> distribution of total scores for each gene in the <dig> gene-long master list. additional file <dig> sources of publicly-available data used in the meta-analysis. abbreviations chip-seqchromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ctcircadian time e-boxenhancer box fdrfalse discovery rate glmgeneralized linear model ppiprotein-protein interaction rnairibonucleic acid interference rreror response element scnsuprachiasmatic nucleus silacstable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture sirnasmall interference rna tftranscription factor ttfltranscriptional-translational feedback loop ztzeitgeber time competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors’ contributions ba and hh designed the study. ab performed the analysis. ba, ab and hh interpreted the results and ba wrote the paper. all authors read and approved the final manuscript.",

<cit> . in most cases, the disease occurs sporadically but can also be preceded by inflammatory bowel disease or a familial genetic predisposition, for example, familial adenomatous polyposis <cit> . as with other cancers, the immune system plays a large role in the control of disease. work by galon et al has shown that a large infiltrating population of cd8+ t cells predicts improved patient outcome <cit> . more mixed results have been obtained regarding other immune cell populations in tumour tissue and their relation to patient outcome . the gut is an immunosuppressive environment and control of local disease may also be altered. for example, in many cancers an increased frequency of infiltrating regulatory t cells correlates with poor outcome but in colorectal cancer, the infiltrate of tregs has been associated with both good and poor outcomes <cit> . it is therefore important to consider this altered environment and to perform observations at this distinct site when considering tissue targeted immunotherapies. orthotopic models of colorectal cancer have been described , but we wished to investigate the ability to modulate the systemic immune response to prevent local tumour growth in the gut. previously, we showed that vaccination with chitosan gel could generate a population of cd8+ memory t cells in both peripheral and gut-associated lymphoid sites <cit> . furthermore, vaccination with chitosan gel also provided protection in a subcutaneous tumour challenge model, both prophylactically and therapeutically <cit> . however due to the specialised nature of the gut immune system the ability of systemic immunisation to protect against a gut tumour is unknown. we showed that vaccination with chitosan gel was protective in an intracaecal mouse model of cancer, while vaccination with dcs was not. the gel-mediated protection was associated with an increase in antigen specific t cells and t cells producing ifn-γ. methods mice c57bl/ <dig> and ot-i transgenic mice were obtained from the htru and were bred and housed under specific pathogen free conditions. all experimental procedures were approved by the university of otago animal ethics committee. no changes in weight or general health were observed in mice following tumour injection with or without vaccination. cell lines b16-ova and b16-luc cell lines were cultured in complete rpmi , 5 % fetal calf serum at 37 °c, 5 % co <dig> b16-ova cells were grown in 5 % complete rpmi with the addition of geneticin at 500 μg/ml to prevent loss of ovalbumin protein expression. formulation of chitosan hydrogel chitosan and methylcellulose were added to <dig> mol/l hydrochloric acid and stirred at 4 °c overnight. glycerol 2-phosphate disodium hydrate was added drop wise to give the solution thermosensitive properties and stirred for a further hour. ovalbumin protein and quil-a were added for a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and 200 μg/ml, respectively, then stirred for a further 30 min to ensure uniform distribution in solution. bone marrow derived dendritic cell generation bone marrow harvested from the leg bones of naïve c57bl/ <dig> mice was cultured for 7 days in complete rpmi and 20 ng/ml gm-csf as described <cit> . for ova vaccinations, cells were pulsed with ova protein overnight on day <dig> at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml followed by 1 μg/ml of lipopolysaccharide overnight on day <dig> dendritic cells were mhcii+ and cd80hi. vaccination and adoptive transfer of cells two hundred microlitres of chitosan hydrogel containing both ova and qa or qa alone , or <dig> × <dig> ova-pulsed dcs in 200 μl phosphate buffered saline , were injected subcutaneously into the flank of c57bl/ <dig> mice. <dig> × <dig> naïve ot-i lymphocytes <cit> were injected intravenously in 200 μl of pbs into the tail vein of mice at the time of vaccination. subcutaneous and intracaecal tumour challenge mice were injected with <dig> × <dig> b16-ova or b16-luc cells subcutaneously in the flank in 100 μl pbs 30 days following vaccination. surgery for intracaecal injection was carried out according to tseng et al <cit> . briefly, mice were anaesthetised one at a time using a combination of ketamine, domitor and atropine injected subcutaneously. pre-operative carporfen was also administered subcutaneously. the abdomen of the mouse was shaved and oil was applied to the eyes. an incision was made through the skin and peritoneum. the caecum was externalised and 25 μl pbs containing 1× <dig> cells was injected under a 10x surgical microscope into the subserosa of the caecum. the caecum was repositioned in the abdominal cavity and peritoneum and skin were resutured separately. the mouse was injected with amphoprim antibiotic and antisedan to reverse the anaesthetic effect. mice were monitored twice daily for 5 days to assess recovery and carporfen and amphoprim were administered twice daily for 2– <dig> days. all drugs and anaesthetics were distributed by the animal welfare office, university of otago. bioluminescence mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μl of luciferin and placed in the induction chamber of an isofluorane based gas anaesthetic device. at <dig> min following administration of luciferin, mice were x-rayed for 30 s and imaged to detect bioluminescence for 5 min. bruker mi and imagej were used for image capture and analysis. flow cytometry single cell suspensions were resuspended in 1 ml pbs and incubated with titrated concentrations of live/dead fixable red dead cell stain for 30 min at 4 °c in the dark. samples were washed with facs buffer and incubated with titrated concentrations of the following fluorescently labelled anti-mouse antibodies for 10 min at 4 °c in the dark: cd8-percpcy <dig> , cd <dig> -bv <dig> , cd122-pe , cd4-apch <dig> , cd19-apch <dig> , vα2-apc , vβ5-fitc , cd44-v <dig> . following this, samples were washed in facs buffer, fixed in 1 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min then resuspended in facs buffer for acquisition on an lsr fortessa and analysed using flowjo . for cytokine detection cells were restimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and ionomycin, and brefeldin-a was added to samples <dig> h before harvesting. samples were incubated with ifn-γ-pe antibodies in permeabilisation buffer for 30 min in the dark at 4 °c and washed three times in permeabilisation buffer. statistical analysis graphpad prism was used for all graphs and statistical analysis. significance was calculated using one-way anova and a tukey post-hoc test as indicated in figure legends. RESULTS development of an intra-caecal model of cancer site-specific murine models of cancer are more reflective of human disease. we wished to develop a model that would allow us to make comparisons with human colorectal cancer, particularly in regard to local immune responses. based on our previous studies showing protection against melanoma using a chitosan hydrogel vaccine delivery formulation, we chose to test immune responses to the vaccine against the same tumour cell line, but injected intra-caecally, to better reflect the local tumour environment of human colorectal cancer. preliminary studies used a b16-luc cell line to establish the model, as it was easily detectable via bioluminescence in vitro and after subcutaneous injection in vivo. similar growth kinetics were observed in the b16-ova cell line as the b16-luc cell line, both in vitro and in vivo . in orthotopic mouse models of colorectal cancer metastases are usually minimal, although they are a major component of the human disease. there is evidence that shows b <dig> cell lines may metastasise to lymph nodes in similar orthotopic models suggesting an advantage for the use of this cell line <cit> . mice were anaesthetised and the caecum was surgically exteriorised following laparotomy so that tumour cells could be injected into the caecal cell wall. cells were injected into the subserosa of the caecum and mice were monitored during recovery and were imaged at days <dig> <dig> and <dig> following surgery to detect the bioluminescent activity of growing tumour cells . at all time points, a bioluminescent signal could be detected in mice . this signal was localised to the predicted site of caecal injection and was later verified following euthanasia of mice and direct visualisation of tumours.fig. <dig> intracaecal model of cancer a mice were anaesthetised and a laparotomy performed. the caecum was exteriorised and tumour cells were injected into the caecal cell wall under 10× magnification. the caecum was returned to the abdominal cavity and the incision was sutured. b 1 × <dig> b16-luc cells were injected intracaecally as described. luciferin was administered to mice and bioluminescence was detected <dig> <dig> and 22 days later. data shows a single representative experiment of two. c 2 × <dig> b16-luc cells were injected subcutaneously or intracaecally . correlation of bioluminescent signal produced to tumour volume are shown. data show a single representative experiment. each experiment was performed twice these results showed that the intra-caecal mouse model of cancer was viable. mice recovered well following surgery, with no discernible weight loss, the b16-luc cell line was able to grow in the gut and the bioluminescent signal from the tumour could be detected even at this increased depth compared to subcutaneous tumours. however, b16-luc tumour size did not correlate well with the bioluminescent signal produced and could not be used to quantify growth non-invasively. however the bioluminescent signal did allow for the detection of extensive tumour growth such that mice could be euthanised at an early humane endpoint. subsequent experiments showed the b16-ova cell line grew in vivo with similar kinetics and time to endpoint. different immune infiltrate in intracaecal compared with subcutaneous tumour microenvironment to determine whether the immune infiltration of cells into tumours differed depending on the location of the tumour, mice were injected with b16-luc expressing cells subcutaneously or intracaecally. twenty days later, tumours and peripheral lymph nodes were excised and labelled with antibodies to surface markers to detect the phenotype of the immune cell infiltrate, including cd3+, cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, b cells, macrophages and dendritic cells . frequencies of populations of all assessed immune cell types in the lymph nodes were similar between mice receiving intracaecal or subcutaneous tumours . however, within the tumour, immune cell infiltrates differed. no significant difference was seen in the frequencies of dendritic cells expressing cd11c and macrophages expressing f4/ <dig> between intracaecal and subcutaneous tumours . a higher frequency of cd3+ t cells was present in the intracaecal tumours than the subcutaneous tumours . interestingly, within the cd3+ population, there was no difference in the distribution of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells between intracaecal and subcutaneous tumours . this may be due to the presence of cd3+cd4−cd8− t cell subsets, including mait cells <cit> or double negative inflammatory cells <cit> . a small but non-significant increase was seen in the frequency of b cells in intracaecal tumours compared to subcutaneous tumours . there was no significant difference in tumour size at the time of excision between intra-caecal and subcutaneous tumours , in line with our previous data <cit> .fig. <dig> immune infiltrate can be detected in mice challenged with b16-luc a percentage cd11c+ of live non-lymphocytes , b percentage f480+ of non-lymphocytes , c percentage cd3+ of lymphocytes , d percentage cd4+ of t cells, e percentage cd8+ of t cells and f percentage cd19+ of lymphocytes in tumours or draining lymph nodes. data are shown as mean ± standard deviation, n = 4– <dig> representative of two individual experiments. one-way anova with turkey post-hoc test was performed. *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , ***p < <dig> , ****p < <dig> the differences in infiltrating lymphocytes between intracaecal and subcutaneous tumours demonstrate that this mouse model of cancer may provide additional insight into immune involvement in cancer of the colon. chitosan gel vaccine is protective in a mouse model of colorectal cancer we have previously demonstrated that subcutaneous injection with vaccine in a sustained release gel generated a population of cd8+ memory t cells at both peripheral lymphoid sites and gut-associated lymphoid sites <cit> . furthermore, this response protected against a subsequent subcutaneous tumour challenge and was effective in treating established tumours. due to the presence of cd8+ memory t cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues following vaccination, we hypothesised that vaccination with the sustained release gel would also provide protection against gut tumours. to test this hypothesis, the intra-caecal mouse model of cancer was used to challenge vaccinated mice. mice were vaccinated subcutaneously with vaccine in chitosan gel , with gel and quil a but no antigen , with a control immune-based vaccine of activated dc pulsed with ova or were unvaccinated. no change in weight, health or survival was observed following vaccination, consistent with previous results <cit> . all mice received adoptive transfer of ot-i lymphocytes as described previously in order to accurately quantify antigen-specific memory responses <cit> . thirty to 34 days later, mice were injected intracaecally with b16-ova. mice were euthanised at the pre-determined time point of <dig> weeks based on tumour growth determined in fig. <dig> ; hence no survival data are available. tumours

peripheral lymph nodes, spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes and peyer’s patches were excised. the frequencies of antigen-specific and memory t cells were examined . as many tumours, particularly in mice vaccinated with gel + ova, were too small or non-existent at the designated time point to retrieve sufficient material for analysis, tumours themselves were not analysed. previously, we have shown the gel + ova vaccination results in a higher frequency of antigen-specific as well as memory antigen-specific cd8+ t cells than gel only or dc-ova vaccination <cit> . to determine whether the higher cell number was consistent after tumour challenge and potentially mediating tumour protection, we measured the frequency of antigen-specific cells in mice following intra-caecal tumour injection. there was a significantly higher frequency of vα2+vβ5+ cd8+ t cells in the peripheral lymph nodes and spleens of mice vaccinated with gel + ova than with other vaccines . in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues, peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, no significant difference was seen in the frequency of vα2+vβ5+ cd8+ t cells seen at each site . the frequency of cd122+cd44+ memory phenotype <cit> cells in the ova-specific cd8+ t cell population was significantly higher in those mice vaccinated with gel + ova compared to all other treatments in lymph nodes and spleen . the absolute number of cells was similar to the frequency of cells in each vaccination group . together, these data demonstrate that mice vaccinated with gel + ova acquired high frequencies of ova-specific cd8+ effector and memory t cells compared to mice receiving other vaccines; similar to results seen in the melanoma model <cit> . taken together, these data indicate that chitosan gel vaccination increases the frequency of memory cd8+ t cells and this results in enhanced protection compared to other vaccines in both intra-caecal and subcutaneous tumour challenge.fig. <dig> vaccination with vaccine in a

order to evaluate new immune therapies in a preclinical setting, appropriate animal models are required. here we have described an intra-caecal model of colorectal cancer in mice and shown that immune modulation of the systemic response can result in tumour protection associated with antigen specific t cells producing ifn-γ, consistent with the human disease <cit> . interestingly we also demonstrated that biological location has an effect on the makeup of immune infiltrate into a tumour. it is well known that in many solid tumours infiltration of high numbers of t cells correlates with improved prognosis <cit> and it has been reported that both b and t cells are important in human colorectal cancer <cit> . interestingly, in this study we found a difference in cd3+ t cell frequencies between intra-caecal and subcutaneous tumours, but no difference in the frequencies of cd4+ or cd8+ t cells. there are many subsets of t cells that may be reflected in this result, including pro-inflammatory “pathogenic” t cells <cit> , naturally occurring t cells that have down-regulated co-receptor expression <cit> , nkt cells and mait cells <cit> , γδ t cells <cit> , and t cells in the context of immune deficiency <cit> ; all of which may be involved in anti-tumour immune responses, especially in the gut. based on these results, further experiments should include an expanded panel of molecules to determine which of these cd3+ populations may have a significant effect on the local tumour immune response. for mucosal immunity, priming of t cells by dcs in gut associated lymphoid tissues preferentially up-regulates mucosal homing receptors on those cells; hence the rationale for testing dc-ova as a vaccine control. in the peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, cd103+ dcs cause up-regulation of ccr <dig> and α4β <dig> on lymphocytes, thus allowing them to migrate to gut mucosa . mucosal vaccines typically take advantage of this mechanism through administration at sites allowing antigen presentation to occur in gut associated lymphoid tissue. however, there are difficulties in developing oral peptide and protein based vaccines in terms of delivery of antigen in an immunogenic form to gut-associated lymphoid tissue. in the intra-caecal mouse model of cancer, the sustained release vaccine, but not a dc vaccine, provided protection. this protection was associated with an increased frequency of tumour specific t cells at peripheral lymphoid but not gut-associated lymphoid tissues. however, the absolute number of cells present in peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes was low and it is possible that a later time-point is needed to detect differences. the frequency of tumour specific memory cd8+cd122+cd44+ t cells was significantly higher in mice vaccinated with the sustained release vaccine in peripheral lymphoid sites sampled consistent with our previous data prior to tumour challenge <cit> . here, we show that this increase is maintained after tumour challenge and is likely to be a correlate of protection. further we show that the frequency of cytokine producing cd8+ and cd4+ t cells detected in the spleen was higher in gel + ova vaccinated mice than others, implying an ifnγ-mediated anti-tumour effect. it is unclear if the tumours generated in this model are susceptible to systemic immunity or if gut-associated immune protection is required. vaccination with the sustained release gel generated a population of antigen-specific cd8+ t cells in both peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, two gut-associated lymphoid sites, but this vaccine also stimulated stronger systemic responses than did the dc vaccine <cit> . therefore it is also possible that protection was conferred through effector memory t cells. while not mucosa specific, these cells are able to track through multiple tissues <cit> . an effective effector memory t cell population generated through vaccination with a sustained release gel may provide protection in multiple different biological locations through the body. the magnitude of the immune response generated by the dc vaccine was in general smaller as compared to the gel vaccine, similar to subcutaneous vaccination <cit> . however the increased production of ifn-γ by ova-specific cd8+ t cells in mice vaccinated with the gel compared to those vaccinated with the dc vaccine indicated that these cells could also have a functional difference. in preliminary experiments we also showed an increased frequency of il-2+ ova-specific cd8+ memory t cells in mice vaccinated with the gel vaccine compared to other vaccine groups . it is possible that these cells may also have an increased capacity for proliferation and survival. this would allow for development of a more robust secondary recall population of cd8+ memory t cells upon tumour challenge. these results also address a potential concern with the use of sustained release vaccines, namely that sustained release of vaccine may result in immune exhaustion rather than the development of effector or memory populations <cit> . it is likely that the kinetics of release as well as the strength of the immune stimulation will impact on the type of response generated therefore caution should be taken when developing sustained release formulations in order to ensure that such parameters are optimised. interestingly the gel itself, in the absence of antigen, induced an increase in the frequency and number of antigen specific ifn-γ producing t cells in the spleens of mice challenged with ova expressing tumour cells. chitosan has been reported to have adjuvant activity <cit> and the gel, while not containing any antigen, was also loaded with the potent th <dig> adjuvant quil a <cit> . the gel would have created an inflammatory depot that may have non-specifically boosted immune reactivity, much the same way the cpg have been used as a therapy to boost anti-tumor immunity <cit> . destruction of the tumour and release of ova by dying tumours would then have led to the development of some degree of antigen specific immunity. mice immunised with the gel only did show some slight evidence of anti-tumor immunity. however as with the cpg studies, inclusion of a tumour antigen with the therapy increases the efficacy of the response <cit> . the b <dig> cell line used for intracaecal challenge is a melanoma cell line. while this allowed for direct comparison to subcutaneous b <dig> challenge ref, in this mouse model of colorectal cancer it may be beneficial to use a mouse colorectal cancer cell line. further experiments using the ct <dig> colorectal cancer cell line expressing an endogenous peptide <cit> or a mc <dig> colorectal cancer cell line expressing ova <cit> may provide more insight into the disease by providing more accuracy to the model system. CONCLUSIONS in a clinical setting, cancer is generally treated therapeutically. in this research, mice were vaccinated prophylactically in order to assess the memory populations of t cells generated. although vaccination with the sustained release proved successful in this setting, further work is required to find whether the same is true when used as a therapy as shown in a subcutaneous model <cit> . if this treatment were to be effective, it would further implicate chitosan gel as a potential anti-cancer vaccine strategy. the ability of vaccination with a sustained release vaccine to work therapeutically would rely on the ability of the activated immune cells to overcome the immunosuppressive effect of the tumour. it is likely this approach would be combined with others targeted at overcoming tumour induced immune suppression in order to achieve maximal therapeutic benefit. additional files additional file 1: figure s <dig> flow cytometry gating for identification of tumour immune cell infiltrates. singlets were identified by gating with fsc- h versus fsc-a then ssc-h versus ssc-a. live cells had low levels of live/dead dye. lymphocytes and large cells were identified based on ssc-a and fsc-a. f4/ <dig> expression was used to designate macrophages within the large cell gate and cd11c was used as an identifying marker of dendritic cells. cd <dig> was used to identify b cells within the lymphocyte gate and cd <dig> was used to identify t cells. cd8+ and cd4+ t cells were identified within the cd <dig> gate. additional file 2: figure s <dig> flow cytometry gating for identification of cytokine producing cells following vaccination and subcutaneous tumour challenge. singlets were identified by gating with fsc-h versus fsc-a then ssc-h versus ssc-a. live cells had low levels of live/dead dye and lymphocytes were identified based on ssc-a and fsc-a. cd8+ t cells were those that expressed cd <dig> and cd4+ t cells were those expressing cd <dig> vα <dig> vβ <dig> double positive cells were identified within the cd <dig> gate and those expressing cd <dig> and cd <dig> were defined as memory cells. ifn-γ production was analysed in cd8+ t cells, cd4+ t cells, vα2+vβ5+ cells and cd122+cd44+ memory cells. additional file 3: figure s <dig> vaccination with vaccine in a chitosan gel increases the absolute cell number of ova-specific cd8+ t cells post challenge with tumour. mice received adoptive transfer of ot-i lymphocytes and were vaccinated with vaccine in a chitosan gel , the gel alone or with vaccine pulsed-dc then challenged intra-caecally with b16-ova 30 days later. number of vα2+vβ5+ t cells of cd8+ t cells is shown in peripheral lymph nodes and spleens at day <dig> number of cd122+cd44+ of vα2+vβ5+ cd8+ t cells is shown in peripheral lymph nodes and spleens at 21 days following challenge. data are shown as mean ± standard deviation, n = 4– <dig> representative of two individual experiments. one-way anova with tukey post-hoc test was performed. **p < <dig> .",

RESULTS data sets creation we first created a dataset of human protein-protein interfaces, starting from complexes of known structure in the protein data bank <cit> . using a simple distance criterion to identify interface residues, we obtained a set of <dig> heterodimeric and <dig> homodimeric interfaces in structures that have a good coverage of the corresponding protein sequences. we will use the term “semi-interface” to refer to a group of interface residues belonging to one of the interacting chains. we then selected all the proteins that could be mapped to a transcript with at least one alternative splicing isoform, thus retaining <dig> heterodimeric semi-interfaces and <dig> homodimeric interfaces. these data sets are redundant because of two main reasons: i) the same interaction can be represented multiple times, not only in different pdb structures but also within the same complex, e.g. in the case of a homomultimer having more than two chains; ii) similar proteins can interact with the same partner by using homologous residues <cit> . in the latter case, even though the pattern of alternative splicing rapidly diverges after gene duplication <cit> , the way in which alternative splicing acts on related interfaces could remain similar, thus introducing some bias in the statistical analysis. to remove redundancy we selected a single representative for each group of interfaces that are similar and belong to similar or identical proteins. we thus obtained a non-redundant data set composed of <dig> heterodimeric semi-interfaces and <dig> homodimeric interfaces. the heterodimeric semi-interfaces we found are mapped to <dig> distinct uniprot <cit> entries, while the homodimeric interfaces to <dig> uniprot entries. a total of <dig> and <dig> distinct alternative isoforms were found for the former and the latter class of proteins, respectively. the uniprot entries were used as reference isoforms, on which the as changes observed in the alternative isoforms were mapped. additional file <dig> contains the list of proteins involved in heterodimeric interactions, together with the alternative splicing isoforms and the number of interface residues they remove, while the additional file <dig> contains the information about the homodimeric interactions. protein-protein interfaces are protected from alternative splicing we sought to determine whether the removal of protein-protein interfaces via alternative splicing occurs at higher or lower frequencies compared to what happens under a random model of splicing. to do this, we followed two alternative approaches, evaluating the splicing of the binding site in each isoform separately or in each group of isoforms from the same gene . due to the different nature of the interaction, these tests were performed on heterodimeric semi-interfaces and homodimeric interfaces separately. indeed, in the first case the alternative splicing of a gene can act only on a single semi-interface, while in the latter there are two semi-interfaces, which differ by varying degrees, that can be spliced away. in the single-isoform test we asked whether the presence or absence of the interface in a specific isoform can be attributed to chance, taking into account the splicing pattern. if this hypothesis is rejected, one can argue that the inclusion or removal of the interacting region might be the result of some evolutionary pressure. to perform this test, we considered every heterodimeric semi-interface/isoform pair and assessed whether the isoform contains the interface region or not. an heterodimeric semi-interface is regarded as removed if the isoform does not contain at least a certain fraction of its residues. since it is not easy to determine what is the minimum percentage of interface residues that must be spliced away in order to abolish the interaction, we repeated the test using different values for this interface-removal threshold. in order to derive a random background against which to evaluate the significance of the observed removal rate, we created <dig> decoys for each isoform , using a procedure that takes into account the specific splicing pattern of the isoform . we then performed a cochran-mantel-haenszel chi-square test <cit> to determine whether the frequency at which alternative splicing removes the interfaces is significantly different from that obtained using the decoys. the results of this test performed on heterodimeric semi-interfaces, using different interface-removal thresholds, are summarized in figure 1a. the percentage of interface/isoform pairs in which the interface is removed via alternative splicing is quite high , but it is still significantly lower than what is observed under a random model of splicing. this difference decreases as the threshold values increases, to become almost zero when the threshold value is equal to 100%. the differences observed using threshold values <= 80% are significant , and the significance is higher for lower thresholds. these results suggest that alternative splicing tends to avoid partial removals of heterodimeric interaction sites, while being quite indifferent to large excisions - possibly because they occur along with major rearrangements of the protein, in which cases there might be no pressure in maintaining the interaction. the single-isoform test for homodimeric interfaces was performed in a similar way, the only difference being that in this case an interface is considered removed if at least one of the two semi-interfaces lacks a certain percentage of its residues or more. as shown in figure 1b, also in this case partial removals of the interface are significantly prevented, though the significance is lost at a lower threshold compared to heterodimers. furthermore, really large interface excisions occur more frequently, but not in a significant way. using the single-isoform test, we can analyse the selective pressure towards interface retention for each individual isoform. however we underestimate all the cases in which the abolishment of the interaction occurs only in one or few isoforms among all those produced by the same gene, while the others are still able to interact, or at least they maintain the interface residues; for example, if a gene has <dig> isoforms, but only one lacks the binding site, the signal coming from that lone isoform is masked by the other four. moreover, different isoforms from the same gene can depend on the same splice junctions, hence the interacting proteins with the largest number of splicing isoforms contribute the most to the final result, not only because they are associated to a higher number of contingency tables in the cmh test , but also because the splicing patterns of their isoforms are somewhat dependent. for these reasons, we performed another test, called all-isoforms test, whose purpose was to determine how likely is for an interface to be selectively removed in at least one isoform. in this case, for each interacting protein we created <dig> random controls, each consisting of a group of decoy isoforms all derived from the real isoforms of its gene. a cmh test was employed to determine whether the frequency at which a binding site is removed in at least one isoform is significantly different from that obtained under this random model of as. the test showed a significant protection form partial removals both for heterodimeric and homodimeric interfaces, even if homodimeric interfaces appear to tolerate larger removals compared to heterodimeric ones . ultimately, the possibility of regulating protein-protein interactions through the production of an isoform which specifically lacks part of the interface region is realized less than expected; the excision of an interface is not so uncommon per se, since, for example, about 42% of the heterodimeric semi-interfaces undergo a removal of 30% or more of their residues in at least one isoform, but there is a general tendency towards the protection of the binding sites from as. interface protection is maintained in similar isoforms the set of isoforms we used includes a number of transcripts that are markedly different from the canonical isoform, i.e. the isoform that corresponds to the pdb chain. these conspicuous changes are likely to result in the disruption of the 3d structure or in the production of a new structural conformation <cit> . therefore, even if the interface region is not removed, it is reasonable to assume that these isoforms would hardly maintain a conformation that allows the interaction. hence, we repeated the previously described statistical analyses including only isoforms that maintain most of the sequence of the canonical protein. we used a variable threshold for this coverage value . both for heterodimeric and homodimeric interfaces, the results of the two tests showed again a significant protection from partial removals, and this was true irrespective of the threshold values . the tendency for alternative splicing to avoid interfaces is thus confirmed in those isoforms that are more likely to be involved in a fine regulation of the interaction. hot spots are not protected more than other interface residues since some interface residues are more important than others for the interaction to be established, we sought to determine the behaviour of alternative splicing towards these protein-protein interaction hot spots. again, we employed the single-isoform and the all-isoforms tests, this time considering only those heterodimeric interface residues that were predicted to be hot spots . the results are very similar to those obtained using all the interface residues . however, it was necessary to establish whether hot spots are more protected than other interface residues or not. to do so, we tested the null hypothesis that, given a heterodimeric semi-interface/isoform pair, the splicing of an interface residue is independent of whether it is a hot spot or not—again, this was done by using a cmh test. hence, although it has been shown that hot spots are often spatially arranged in clusters called “hot regions” <cit> , and a manual control of the distribution of the hot spots on the sequence revealed that they tend to form clusters also in the primary structure, the protection from partial removals of the interacting region is not selective towards these most important residues. possibly this occurs because any rearrangement of the interacting site is likely to have some influence on the interaction or, more in general, on the functionality of the protein. functional significance of interface protection/removal selectivity using the number of random controls that removes an interface, it is possible to quantify how selectively targeted is the removal or the protection of the interface residues . we selected proteins in which removal/protection of the binding site is more specific, and determined whether these two classes of proteins differ by properties that can be described using gene ontology <cit> terms. to this end we evaluated the enrichment of go terms in all the three main ontologies for both classes of proteins. no significant enrichments were observed both for the heterodimeric and the homodimeric interactions, suggesting that the protection of the interface is a widespread phenomenon among proteins with different characteristics and that the selective removal of the interface is not preferentially restricted to a specific group of proteins sharing the same function or localization. though the results of this work suggest that interfaces are protected from as, there are some cases in which the alternative splicing of the pre-mrna is focused on the interacting region, as reported in additional file <dig> and <dig> . we searched literature to investigate some of these cases, but we did not find any example in which the involved isoform has been characterized as non-interacting. however, we discovered a potential example of this regulation, involving the interaction between cullin 4a and dna damage-binding protein <dig> . together with roc <dig> which interacts with cul4a, these proteins form a complex , which acts as an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that, among other things, participates in the degradation of dna damage-response proteins <cit> . the n-terminal region of cul4a is bound to a beta-propeller domain of ddb <dig> the cul4a pre-mrna undergoes alternative splicing: the protein observed in the crystal can be mapped to the ensembl <cit> enst <dig> , while three other full-length coding transcripts exist, which share the same coding sequence. the only difference between the coding sequence of the alternative transcripts and that of the canonical one is that the former lacks the first <dig> residues of the latter. figure <dig> shows the interaction between cul4a and ddb <dig> and highlights the region of cul4a that is missing in the alternative isoforms. to our knowledge, the functionality of the alternative isoforms has not been well characterized. however it is quite likely that, since they lack <dig> of the <dig> semi-interface residues, they are not capable of binding ddb <dig> indeed it has been reported that the deletion of the first <dig> amino acids of the canonical protein completely abolishes ddb <dig> binding <cit> . despite the general trend towards protection of interfaces from as, in this case we observe a selective partial removal of the interface, and this is likely to result in the production of protein isoforms that cannot bind to a specific partner. we also investigated the tissue-specific expression patterns of the transcripts encoding cul4a. as shown in figure <dig> the canonical isoform is expressed only in some tissues, while the expression of the alternative transcripts taken together covers all the tissues and is higher than that of the canonical transcript in the tissues where it is present. hence, in addition to other regulatory processes that might influence the interaction, alternative splicing seems to provide a mechanism through which the association of cul4a with ddb <dig> is only possible in a specific subset of human tissues. CONCLUSIONS the present study demonstrates that the removal of protein-protein interfaces by as is generally avoided in the human proteome, and this holds true for both heterodimeric and homodimeric interactions. these results are not in disagreement with previous works demonstrating that protein-protein interaction domains and protein interaction-associated linear motifs are significantly found in alternatively spliced regions <cit> . indeed, in the analysed dataset, only ~37% of the heterodimeric semi-interfaces and only ~45% of the homodimeric interfaces we analysed are fully included in a pfam <cit> domain. moreover, putative slims interacting with domains are present in very low amounts in our data set. we used the ielm web server <cit> to analyse our lists of heterodimeric and homodimeric interacting protein pairs and predict slim-mediated interactions, and we found that only <dig> out of <dig> heterodimeric semi-interfaces and <dig> out of <dig> homodimeric interfaces contain at least one residue belonging to a putative domain-binding slim. we additionally verified whether the protein interaction interfaces in our datasets overlap with protein disordered regions, since it is known that as events are preferentially located in such locations <cit> : these regions are enriched in functional motifs <cit> and are more tolerant to the structural changes introduced by as. since they are derived from the three-dimensional structures of crystallized proteins, our binding sites are almost totally localized outside disordered regions: only <dig> heterodimeric semi-interfaces and <dig> homodimeric interfaces have 30% or more of their residues in a putative disordered conformation . this is due to the fact that these sites are derived from the three-dimensional structures of crystallized proteins; furthermore, we filtered out those crystallized dimers in which the two interacting chains cover less than 30% of the complete protein sequence, thereby eliminating the interactions mediated by small peptides, which are often embedded into disordered regions. given all these results, it is clear that the feasibility of an as-mediated removal of the binding site depends on the structural characteristics of the interaction, since, for instance, it is easier to modulate the inclusion of slims, which are often localized in disordered regions, than it is to remove or substitute binding sites that reside in structurally defined regions. in any case, these considerations do not concern those cases in which the regulation of the interaction does not consist in a direct removal/substitution of the region involved in the interaction , e.g. when a sequence is inserted within a binding domain. our findings are confirmed even when we consider only those alternative transcripts whose coding sequence is only slightly different from that of the canonical isoforms. moreover, the protection from alternative splicing is not limited to the interface residues that significantly contribute to the binding free energy, thus emphasizing the importance of maintaining the global architecture of the binding site. this requirement seems to be common to proteins with different properties: the proteins in which alternative splicing selectively avoids the binding site were not found to be prevalently associated to any specific function, biological process or localization. this was also observed for those proteins in which the binding site is selectively removed in one or more isoforms. we studied one of these cases, represented by the partial removal of the region through which cullin 4a interacts with ddb <dig> and found that the isoforms lacking the binding site show an expression pattern that greatly differs from that of the interacting protein. recent works show how the tissue-specific as of protein-protein binding sites, especially when disordered, has an important role in rewiring protein-protein interaction networks in a tissue-specific fashion <cit> . as a further extension of our study, we are currently analysing splicing isoform-specific expression patterns in combination with our dataset of binding sites, which reside mostly outside disordered regions, in order to understand how isoforms containing a different portion of a structured binding site are used in different tissues and/or conditions.",

evolutionary properties were measured from statistical models <cit> ; secondary structure and accessibility were computed from various prediction programs <cit> ; database annotations were also included <cit> . however, the availability of protein or homologous proteins' structures limits the scope of the applications of these methods. in addition, most of these prediction methods are complicated and the prediction results are difficult to interpret, because a large number of complicated features are used and many of them rely heavily on other computational models. although in some methods simple features were used with some specifically designed statistical models <cit> , the prediction accuracy is not as high as those methods using combined multiple features <cit> . a good feature set should contain as few features as possible, while each feature should have clear physicochemical meaning and is easy to be interpreted in biological terms. to achieve these objectives, we derived a novel feature set based on three physicochemical properties of amino acids, three relative frequencies of occurrences of amino acids in the secondary structures of proteins with known secondary structural information, and the evolutionary profile of the protein containing the substitution. we compared the quality of the proposed feature set with other more complicated ones by applying the decision tree <cit> , the support vector machine <cit> , and the random forest <cit> to the experimental amino acid substitution data of the e. coli lac repressor <cit> and the bacteriophage t <dig> lysozyme <cit> , as well as to a wide range of human amino acid substitutions collected in the swiss-prot database. the results showed that our simple yet interpretable feature set was superior to other published ones <cit> in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve , the balanced error rate , and the matthews' correlation coefficient . although existing machine learning methods could make predictions, they acted like \"black boxes\" in that they were not capable of capturing physicochemical principles behind the predictions. in many circumstances, however, these hidden principles were of more importance since they could reveal how amino acid substitutions affected protein functions and why some amino acid substitutions would result in diseases. in order to explore these principles and associate amino acid substitutions with biological knowledge, we would use rule induction methods to automatically search rules for amino acid substitutions. these rules should be interpretable, consisting of a small set of simple features; high-quality, with very few exceptions; and general, capable of explaining a significant number of substitutions. in this paper, we considered rules as sub-regions in the feature space composed of amino acid substitutions. more specifically, the boxes were defined in terms of the feature intervals. a previous method for finding boxes in the feature space was the patient rule induction method <cit> , which searched for optimal boxes using a steepest-ascent approach and was intuitively referred to as a \"bump hunting\" method. when applied to our problem, the prim had drawbacks in that the imbalance between the numbers of data samples in different categories was not considered, and some redundant features in the boxes should be manually removed and the quality of the resulting boxes significantly decreased. to overcome these shortcomings, we incorporated a new criterion called the discrimination power to take the imbalance between the numbers of data samples in different categories into consideration, and developed a novel simulated annealing bump hunting strategy which made use of the simulated annealing method to automatically discard redundant features while extracting high quality rules. we validated this strategy using heterogenous experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in both the e. coli lac repressor <cit> and the bacteriophage t <dig> lysozyme <cit> , and showed that our approach could extract rules with comparable converge and accuracy but much better interpretability as those extracted by the original prim method. we then applied our strategy to annotated human amino acid substitutions collected in the swiss-prot database and successfully identified several rules which could be interpreted using physicochemical terms and were consistent with the current biological knowledge. we further applied the induced intolerant rules to unclassified human amino acid substitution data, and the results showed that these rules could cover a large portion of data samples and most of the covered samples showed good agreement with predictions made by either the support vector machine or the random forest. beyond the highly confident predictions, these rules more importantly revealed the physicochemical principles behind the covered amino acid substitutions and explained why these substitutions would result in diseases. RESULTS data sources a large number of amino acid substitutions occurring in human proteins have been collected in the swiss-prot protein database <cit> . in version <dig> , the swiss-prot database contained <dig> amino acid substitution entries in <dig> human proteins, with each substitution being annotated as \"disease\", \"polymorphism\", or \"unclassified\". for a clear and concise presentation, we would refer to amino acid substitutions with the annotation \"disease\" as intolerant ones and those with the annotation \"polymorphism\" as tolerant ones. in this paper, we studied human proteins having at least <dig> homologous proteins in the pfam database <cit> , and focused on the substitutions occurring in known protein domains. in total, we collected <dig> <dig> intolerant substitutions, <dig> <dig> tolerant substitutions, and <dig> unclassified ones in <dig> <dig> human proteins. in order to validate the proposed feature set and the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy, two sets of experimental amino acid substitution data for the e. coli lac repressor <cit> and the bacteriophage t <dig> lysozyme <cit> were used. in these data sets, the effects of amino acid substitutions on the function of the corresponding protein were rated and classified to four categories. in the case of the lac repressor, the four categories were \"+\" , \"+-\" , \"-+\" , and \"-\" . in the case of the t <dig> lysozyme, the four categories were \"++\" , \"+\" , \"+/-\" , and \"-\" . following the definition used by chasman and adams <cit> , as well as by krishnan and westhead <cit> , substitutions falling into the \"no effect\" category were treated as tolerant ones, and substitutions in the other categories were regarded as intolerant ones. in total, for the e. coli lac repressor, we collected <dig> intolerant substitutions and <dig> tolerant ones. for the t <dig> lysozyme, we collected <dig> intolerant substitutions and <dig> tolerant ones. prediction of the experimental amino acid substitutions we first show that the proposed feature set can outperform other published feature sets in the prediction of potential effects of experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor <cit> and the t <dig> lysozyme <cit> . we performed 10-fold cross-validation experiments using both the support vector machine and the random forest with the proposed feature set on the substitution samples, calculated the area under the roc curve , the minimum balanced error rate , and the maximum matthews' correlation coefficient , and compared them with other published results. detailed descriptions regarding the prediction methods and the definition of the criteria are presented in the method section. the cross-validation results using our feature set are shown in table <dig> first, we can see from the table that for the experimental substitutions occurring in homogenous proteins, our feature set works well with both the support vector machine and the random forest. when working with the random forest, the discrete form of our feature set can produce an auc of <dig> , a ber of <dig> , and a mcc of <dig> for the experimental substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor, suggesting that about 88% of the substitutions can be predicted accurately. when working with the support vector machine, the results are slightly worse, but the continuous form of our feature set can still predict about 85% substitutions accurately. for experimental substitutions occurring in the t <dig> lysozyme, we obtain similar results. second, the results show that our feature set can also work well for experimental substitutions occurring in heterogenous proteins. when applied to the mixed samples occurring in both the e. coli lac repressor and the t <dig> lysozyme, the random forest with the discrete form of our feature set can produce an auc of <dig> , a ber of <dig> , and a mcc of <dig> , suggesting that about 85% of the substitutions can be predicted accurately. thirdly, we notice that in our studies, the random forest works slightly better than the support vector machine with our feature set in terms of the auc, the ber, and the mcc. we compared the cross-validation results using our feature set with those obtained by the sift and another published feature set . as a sequence homology-based method, the sift can achieve bers of 33% and 34% for experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor and the t <dig> lysozyme, respectively. by comparison, the continuous form of our feature set can achieve corresponding bers of 14% and 17% when working with the random forest , respectively. these results suggest that our feature set can outperform the sift in the prediction of potential effects of experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in homogenous proteins. the published feature set by krishnan and westhead <cit> uses <dig> features, including <dig> sequence based ones , sequence conservation score at the mutated position, molecular mass shift on mutation, and hydrophobicity difference), and <dig> structure based ones . when working with the support vector machine, this feature set can achieve bers of 27%, 29%, and 28% for experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor, the t <dig> lysozyme, and the mixture of them, respectively, while the continuous form of our feature set can achieve corresponding bers of 15%, 18%, and 19%, respectively. when working with the decision tree, the published feature set can achieve bers of 16%, 20%, and 21% for experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor, the t <dig> lysozyme, and the mixture of them, respectively, while the continuous form of our feature set can achieve corresponding bers of 16%, 18%, and 19%, respectively. these results suggest that our feature set can work as good as or outperform the published feature set <cit> in the prediction of potential effects of experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in both homogenous and heterogenous proteins. prediction of the disease related amino acid substitutions we performed 10-fold cross-validation experiments using both the support vector machine and the random forest with the proposed feature set on amino acid substitutions occurring in highly heterogenous human proteins and collected in the swiss-prot database, and compared the results with other published results . the published method <cit> used a complicated feature set. for every substitution pair, they directly used two three-dimensional structural information predicted by the environment program <cit> , one secondary structural information predicted by the stride program <cit> , and one statistical score calculated by the sift program <cit> . their feature set also included another feature derived from the prediction results of these programs, and the wild-type amino acid identity. altogether, they used six features. five of them were three-dimensional structural or statistical ones, and needed to be calculated using other programs. due to the limited availability of three-dimensional structural information, only a small fraction of available substitutions in the swiss-prot database could be considered in their method. in contrast, our proposed feature set used only sequence information and evolutionary profiles, and did not depend on any other prediction programs. consequently, we could predict more substitutions in a wider range of human proteins. for comprehensive measures, figure <dig> shows the roc curves for the support vector machine and the random forest using the proposed continuous form of our feature set. when compared with the sift and the method used by bao and cui , we can see clearly that both methods using our feature set produce better roc curves , indicating that the proposed feature set is superior to both the sift and the feature set presented in <cit> in terms of comprehensive prediction power . for the discrete form, the auc is <dig> for the support vector machine and <dig> for the random forest, and the roc curves are similar to those using the continuous form. more specifically, we compared the two criteria for a certain single decision threshold, as shown in table <dig> when working with the support vector machine, the continuous form of our feature set leads the sift by about 4% in ber and about <dig> in mcc. when working with the random forest, the continuous form of our feature set leads the sift by about 5% in ber and about <dig> in mcc. similar results are obtained when comparing the discrete form of our feature set with the sift. these results suggest that our feature set can outperform the sift in the prediction of amino acid substitutions occurring in human proteins. when comparing our results with those obtained using the feature set proposed in <cit> , we can see from the table that for both prediction methods using the proposed feature set, the bers are much smaller while the mccs are much larger than the corresponding method using the feature set presented in <cit> , indicating that our feature set are much better than the published one. correlation and relative importance of the proposed features for better understanding of the relationship between the proposed features, we calculated the pairwise pearson's correlation coefficients between the proposed features based on the amino acid substitutions occurring in human proteins and presented the correlation matrix in figure <dig> we divided the features to <dig> groups according to their definitions in the method section, and named these groups at the top of the matrix. first, we can see from the matrix that the two evolutionary conservation scores have very weak correlations with other <dig> features. second, for the original amino acid group , the window-sized group , and the column-weighted group , features derived from the same properties show medium positive correlations, as illustrated in region <dig> <dig> and <dig> in the matrix. third, the relative change features show strong positive correlations with the substitution features derived from the same properties and strong negative correlations with the original, the window-sized, or the column-weighted features , as illustrated in region <dig> <dig> and <dig> respectively. finally, as shown in region <dig> in the matrix, the relative change features derived from the same properties show strong positive correlations . we also calculated the correlation matrix for the discrete form of the proposed features based on the amino acid substitutions occurring in human proteins and observed similar results . these observations, though can be intuitively explained from the definitions and calculation schemes of the features , provide us informative understanding and quantitative measurement of the relationship between the proposed features and can be used as evidences in the future feature selection procedure. we then evaluated the relative importance of the proposed features using the scheme included in the random forest and presented the results in figure <dig> in the random forest, the raw importance of a feature is calculated by randomly permuting the values of the feature in the out-of-bag cases, calculating the difference of classification errors between the original and the permuted cases, and averaging this difference over all the trees in the forest <cit> . to make the measurement of importance more understandable, a normalization procedure is further applied to the raw importance of each feature by dividing the raw importance with the maximum raw importance over all the features . consequently, the relative importance of every proposed feature is obtained. for the continuous form of the proposed features , we can see that the two evolutionary conservation scores are of the most importance. the column-weighted group and the substitution-column group have similar importance and follow the evolutionary score group. for other groups of features, the order of importance is the substitution-original group > the original group > the substitution-window group > the substitution group > the window-sized group . for individual features, the first <dig> most important features are ordered as x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> > x <dig> on the one hand, all of the <dig> features except for x <dig> in this order are calculated with the evolutionary conservation scores , revealing the significant importance of the evolutionary information in the prediction of potential effects of amino acid substitutions. on the other hand, the frequent appearances of the features derived from the molecular weight , the hydrophobicity scale , and the relative frequency in turns in this order suggest the importance of these properties in the identification of human disease related amino acid substitutions. for the discrete form of the proposed features , the results show that the relative importance of the window-sized, the column-weighted, and the relative change features are not as good as their continuous forms, suggesting that the discretization procedure causes information loss for individual features. when looking at the order of the top <dig> most informative features , we confirm the importance of the evolutionary information , the molecular weight , the hydrophobicity scale , and the relative frequency in turns . validation of the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy a merit property of the discrete form of our feature set is that every feature has strong physico-chemical meaning, which enables us to induce interpretable rules to explain the biological principles behind amino acid substitutions. we first validated the proposed simulated annealing bump hunting strategy using the heterogenous experimental amino acid substitution data. we randomly divided the mixed substitution samples occurring in the e. coli lac repressor and the t <dig> lysozyme into a training set and a test set , applied the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy to the training set, and evaluated the resulting rules on the test set. as an example, table <dig> lists ten rules extracted by the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy. from the table, we can see that the extracted rules have comparable coverage , accuracy , and discrimination power for the training and test set, suggesting that our strategy is capable of extracting general rules. for example, for intolerant rules, the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy extracted a 1-feature rule with a coverage of <dig> and an accuracy of <dig> from the training set, while the same rule have a coverage of <dig> and an accuracy of <dig> when evaluated using the test set. we also made a comparison between the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy and the original patient rule induction method , which was implemented in the supergem software <cit> . some candidate rules are shown in figure <dig> from the figure, we can see that the rules extracted by the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy have comparable coverage and accuracy but much better interpretability as the rules extracted by the original prim method. for example, for intolerant rules , the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy extracted a 5-feature rule with a coverage of <dig> and an accuracy of <dig> , while the original prim method extracted a <dig> feature rule with comparable coverage and accuracy. similarly, for tolerant rules , the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy extracted a 4-feature rule with a coverage of <dig> and an accuracy of <dig> , while the original prim method extracted a <dig> feature rule with comparable coverage and accuracy. amino acid substitution rules we applied the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy with the discrete form of our feature set to the human amino acid substitution data and extracted several rules which were consistent with current biological knowledge. as examples, figure <dig> presents a group of three intolerant rules which uses conservation scores and provides us general understanding regarding the intolerant substitutions. detailed descriptions regarding the notations and definitions of the features are presented in the method section. rule <dig> in figure <dig> says that for a substitution pair, if the substituted amino acid never appears in the column of the pfam multiple sequence alignment, the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses a single feature and covers 29% data samples with an accuracy of 88% and a discrimination power of <dig> . rule <dig> in figure <dig> says that for a substitution pair, if the substituted amino acid rarely appears in the corresponding column of the pfam multiple sequence alignment, the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses a single feature , covering <dig> % data samples with an accuracy of 92% and a discrimination power of <dig> . rule <dig> in figure <dig> says that for a substitution pair, if the original amino acid very abundantly appears in the corresponding column of the pfam multiple sequence alignment, the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses a single feature , covering 14% data samples with an accuracy of 95% and a discrimination power of <dig> . these rules can be understood as follows. in the pfam multiple sequence alignments, homologous proteins are aligned according to their functional units . hence, amino acids appearing in a certain column of an alignment would be those that are crucial in maintaining the protein function. on the contrary, amino acids rarely appearing in a certain column of an alignment would very likely be irrelevant to the protein function. therefore, in rule <dig> and rule <dig> when an amino acid is substituted by another amino acid which never or rarely appears in the multiple sequence alignment, the function of the protein could hardly be maintained. in rule <dig> the very abundant appearance of the original amino acid in the multiple sequence alignment indicates that the amino acid is crucial in keeping the protein function. therefore, when the amino acid is substituted, the protein would very likely be malfunction. the second group of three rules uses physicochemical features and provides us specific understanding regarding the intolerant substitutions for individual amino acids, as illustrated in figure <dig> rule <dig> in figure <dig> says that if a cysteine is substituted, no matter what kind of amino acids it is substituted to, the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses a single feature , covering <dig> % data samples with an accuracy of 91% and a discrimination power of <dig> . the cysteine is the only amino acid capable of forming disulfide bonds, and the disulfide bridges between cysteines within a polypeptide support the protein's secondary structure. therefore, when a cysteines is substituted, the structure would be destroyed, and the protein would lose its function. rule <dig> in figure <dig> says that when a glycine is substituted, if the evolutionary profile medium or highly prefers turns , the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses <dig> features , covering <dig> % data samples with an accuracy of 95% and a discrimination power of <dig> . this rule can be understood from two aspects. first, the glycine is the smallest amino acid. therefore, when a glycine is substituted by any other amino acids, there might not be enough space to hold that amino acid, and thus the secondary structure of the polypeptide would be destroyed. as a result, the protein would lose its function. second, the glycine is one of the amino acids most prefer turns . hence, when the turn structure is important to the protein function and a glycine is substituted, the function of the protein would very likely change. rule <dig> in figure <dig> says that when an amino acid is substituted by an arginine, if the evolutionary profile is acidic , and the substituted amino acid has a medium to strongly negative change in hydrophobicity versus the evolutionary profile , the substitution is very likely to be intolerant. this rule uses <dig> features , covering <dig> % data samples with an accuracy of 93% and a discrimination power of <dig> . this rule can be understood from the following aspects. first, the arginine is the most alkalic and most hydrophilic amino acid. second, an acidic evolutionary profile indicates that amino acids with small pi values are crucial to the protein's function. thirdly, the substituted amino acid having medium to strongly negative change in hydrophobicity scale suggests that hydrophilic amino acids are the majority in the homologous proteins . therefore, when an arginine replaces the original amino acid, the above second and third conditions are violated, and thus the function of the protein would be destroyed. the third group of three rules uses both the conservation scores and the physicochemical features, and provides us specific understanding regarding the tolerant substitutions, as illustrated in figure <dig> rule <dig> in figure <dig> says that if the substituted amino acid appears in the multiple sequence alignment with a rather high frequency , the substitution is very likely to be tolerant. this rule uses a single feature , covering <dig> % data samples with an accuracy of 81% and a discrimination power of <dig> . this rule can be thought of as the opposite of the previous rule <dig> and rule <dig> amino acids appearing in a certain column of a pfam multiple sequence alignment would be those that are crucial in maintaining the protein function. therefore, when an amino acid is substituted by another amino acid which appears in the multiple sequence alignment with a rather high frequency, the function of the protein could possibly be maintained, and the substitution is likely to be tolerant. rule <dig> in figure <dig> says that if the original amino acid appears in a hydrophilic local environment and the substituted amino acid appears in the multiple sequence alignment with a relatively high frequency , the substitution is very likely to be tolerant. this rule uses <dig> features , covering <dig> % data samples with an accuracy of 74% and a discrimination power of <dig> . the understanding of this rule is similar to the previous rule <dig> amino acids appearing in a certain column of a pfam multiple sequence alignment would be those that relate to the maintenance of the protein function. hence, when an amino acid is substituted by another amino acid which appears in the multiple sequence alignment with a relatively high frequency, the function of the protein could possibly be maintained, and the substitution is likely to be tolerant. rule <dig> in figure <dig> says that when one of the amino acids in the set of {w, v, g, l, i} is substituted by one of the amino acids the set of {v, i} , if the substituted amino acid has a neutral change in molecular weight against the original one , the substitution is likely to be tolerant. this rule uses <dig> features , covering <dig> % data samples with an accuracy of 77% and a discrimination power of <dig> . the principle behind this rule is that when amino acids are substituted by other amino acids having similar physicochemical properties, the structure of the protein is likely to be maintained, and thus the function of the protein is likely to be kept. prediction of the unclassified amino acid substitutions we further applied the support vector machine and the random forest with the discrete form of our feature set to predict potential effects of unclassified amino acid substitutions in human proteins. we first used the 10-fold cross-validation experiments to determine the decision threshold for each method so that the balanced error rate could be minimized in the experiments, and then applied each method with the corresponding decision threshold on the unclassified data to make predictions. the results are shown in figure <dig> within the <dig> unclassified amino acid substitutions, the support vector machine predicted <dig> as intolerant and <dig> as tolerant, while the random forest predicted <dig> as intolerant and <dig> as tolerant. <dig> substitutions were predicted as intolerant and <dig> were predicted as tolerant by both methods. these overlapping predictions were therefore with high confidence. we also applied the six intolerant rules induced by the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy in the previous section to the unclassified data. in total, the six intolerant rules covered <dig> data samples, and <dig> out of them were also predicted as intolerant by both the support vector machine and the random forest. besides, <dig> samples covered by these rules were also predicted as intolerant by one of the prediction methods. only <dig> samples were not predicted as intolerant by either method. these statistics suggested that the induced interpretable rules were general , and were of very high quality . more importantly, beyond the highly confident predictions, these rules also revealed the physicochemical principles behind the covered amino acid substitutions and explained why these substitutions would be intolerant. discussion and CONCLUSIONS most contemporary studies aiming at predicting potential effects of amino acid substitutions made use of complicated and not widely available properties of amino acids and proteins. to overcome these limitations, we proposed a feature set based on three physicochemical properties of amino acids, three relative frequencies of amino acids in the secondary structures of proteins with known secondary structure information, and two evolutionary conservation scores. we applied three machine learning methods with our feature set to experimental amino acid substitutions occurring in the e. coli lac repressor and the bacteriophage t <dig> lysozyme, and showed that the methods using our feature set could achieve preferred prediction results in terms of the area under the roc curve, the balanced error rate, and the matthews' correlation coefficient. we further applied the support vector machine and the random forest with our feature set to a large number of amino acid substitutions occurring in highly heterogenous human proteins, and showed that our feature set could be applied to a much wider range of human proteins and the prediction methods using our feature set were superior to those using the existing more complicated feature sets. although existing methods could produce reasonable predictions, they were not capable of capturing physicochemical principles behind the predictions. in many situations, however, these hidden principles were of more importance because they could uncover how amino acid substitutions affect protein functions and why some substitutions would result in diseases. in order to explore these principles, we used a novel designed rule induction method called the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy to automatically extract interpretable rules for amino acid substitutions. the induced rules were either consistent with current biological knowledge or providing new insights for the understanding of the physicochemical principles behind amino acid substitutions. one limitation of our feature set is that we currently use the pfam multiple sequence alignment to extract evolutionary information for the query protein sequence. as a result, we are limited to deal with amino acid substitutions occurring in known protein domains. this limitation can be overcome by using some other multiple sequence alignment method such as the psi-blast and clustalw instead of the pfam. another limitation of our feature set is that the number of features is large, and some of them are highly correlated. although good results have been achieved, integrating feature selection mechanisms in prediction methods could further improve the prediction performance. this demand is especially urgent when using the support vector machine as the prediction method. a third limitation is regarding how to perform fair and comprehensive comparisons between feature sets and prediction methods proposed in different literatures, especially when the training and test samples are of different sizes and from different data sources. although this direction is not the focus in this paper, it would be of great importance and necessity in developing a general benchmark system using unified statistical criteria in our future work. as for the simulated annealing bump hunting strategy, there exist two free parameters . although free parameters incorporate more flexibility into the method, they make the computational burden heavier . how to design an automated mechanism to guide the determination of these free parameters remains an ongoing study. also, although the nine presented rules could be well explained, there exist some other rules which are not easy to be interpreted by current biological knowledge, especially when the rules contain many features. how to simplify our feature set to make the rules more interpretable forms another research focus. despite the limitations, we showed that our results were reasonably good. when using our feature set with the support vector machine and the random forest, we obtained better roc curves and smaller prediction error rates in the cross-validation experiments. when applied to unclassified data, the six induced intolerant rules could cover a large portion of data samples, and most of the covered substitutions were also predicted as intolerant by either the support vector machine or the random forest. more importantly, beyond the highly confident predictions, these rules could also reveal the physicochemical principles behind the covered samples and explain why these substitutions would cause diseases.",

the pig is an excellent model species, owing to its physiological similarity to human and relative availability, and its own importance as target species. our method, based on modified use of surface coating reagents , and of proliferation and differentiation media, allowed efficient differentiation and fusion of myoblasts into myotubes that remained adherent to the culture surface for over <dig> weeks of differentiation. to our knowledge, we are able for the first time to recapitulate in vitro the maturation process of myotubes in 2d to resemble postnatal fibre types which is a major technical advance in the ability to study phenotype plasticity. methods culture of porcine myoblasts and myotubes porcine muscle satellite cells were isolated from skeletal muscles of <dig> to <dig> weeks old commercial large white-cross pigs as previously described <cit> . this work was approved by the school of veterinary medicine and science ethical committee. pigs were humanely euthanased according to schedule <dig> to the animals act <dig> all myoblasts and myotubes were grown on optimised coated surfaces. into each well of a 12-well plate was applied 400 μl of <dig> μm filter sterilised maxgel coating mixture , comprising a 1: <dig> mix ratio of 1 % maxgel ecm solution and 2 % rat type i collagen solution , which was left to fully dry overnight in a cell culture cabinet and rinsed with pbs before use. for other size plates or flasks, the volume of mc+ used was proportionally scaled. newly harvested satellite cells were grown in proliferation medium , comprising skgm- <dig> medium with added 10 % heat inactivated fetal calf serum , 2 % chick embryo extract and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin , in a <dig> °c incubator with gas mixture of 5 % co <dig> and 5 % o <dig> with complete replacement of pm every 2 days. myoblasts were passaged once at a ratio of 1: <dig> in pm before freezing in a mixture of 50 % fcs, 10 % dimethylsulphoxide and 40 % pm, and storing in liquid nitrogen. depending on seeding density of thawed myoblasts, <dig> million cells in a t <dig> flask should reach <dig> to 70 % confluence by 3- <dig> days of culture. at around <dig> to 90 % confluence, the cells were rinsed and replaced with differentiation medium <dig> comprising dmem high glucose with <dig> % ultroser g and 1 % p/s. ultroser g is a proprietary serum replacement containing a cocktail of undisclosed growth factors. extensive myotubes should form by <dig> to 4 days of differentiation. for long-term maintenance of the myotubes, from day 5– <dig> of differentiation, 25 % volume of the original dm <dig> was replaced every third day with fresh dm <dig> or differentiation medium <dig> . in this way, good myotube integrity was readily maintained for several weeks. cell viability measurement of mitochondrial activity in myotubes, as an indication of cell viability, was performed in a 96-well format with a celltiter <dig> aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the mts kit is composed of solutions of a novel tetrazolium compound and an electron coupling reagent . mts is bioreduced by cells into a formazan product that is soluble in cell culture medium. the conversion of mts into the aqueous soluble formazan product is accomplished by dehydrogenase enzymes found in metabolically active cells. the quantity of formazan product is directly proportional to the number or activity of living cells in culture. real time pcr rna extraction from myoblasts and myotubes was performed with an rneasy fibrous tissue mini kit . taqman real-time pcr was used to quantify the expression of six porcine myhc gene isoforms using primers and taqman probes as previously described . forward and reverse primers for the sybr green detection of putative porcine long intergenic non-coding -myh are 5′-gaggctcgggaaggaatcc-3′ and 5′-tgccctctggtggtaaaagc-3′. forward and reverse primers for porcine six <dig> and eya <dig> detection are 5′-gttcaagaaccgaaggcaac-3′ and 5′-ccccttccagaggagagagt-3′, and 5′-cagctctccatatccagcacatt-3′ and 5′-tttgtggacggcgtcgta-3′ respectively. a relative standard curve was used to quantify the expression of each gene normalised to its corresponding 18s rrna expression. RESULTS culture of primary porcine muscle cells greater than 95 % of isolated porcine muscle cells, derived from the longissimus dorsi of <dig> to <dig> weeks old pigs, expressed transcription factors pax <dig> and pax <dig> indicating that the isolated cells were highly enriched for muscle satellite cells <cit> . porcine myoblasts were grown in pm in culture plates or flasks coated with a specified volume of mc+ that was fully dried overnight . when myoblasts reached around 80 % confluence, usually by day <dig> or <dig> of culture from frozen stock, pm was replaced with differentiation medium containing ultroser g . by 5 days of differentiation, we typically detected an abundance of discrete myhc slow and fast myotubes which was in marked contrast to conventional cultures for porcine myotubes where few myotubes were found . with our improved protocol, the efficiency of myotube formation remained unaffected over seven myoblast passages .fig. <dig> characterisation of primary porcine muscle cells. a highly enriched myoblasts were isolated from <dig> to <dig> week old muscles , as evidenced by nuclear detection of pax <dig> and pax <dig> . b extensive discrete immunodetection of myhc slow and fast in myotubes at day <dig> differentiation. c by contrast, myotube formation was typically low using standard media as proliferation medium, and mem with 2 % horse serum and 1 % p/s as differentiation medium <cit> ). immunodetection of α-actin was confined to a limited number of myoblasts/myotubes over 12 days of differentiation. day = days of differentiation. d present protocol conferred comparably high levels of myotube formation over <dig> passages of porcine myoblasts. hematoxylin and eosin stained myotubes at day <dig> differentiation from p <dig> p <dig> and p7 enhanced myotube differentiation and sustained viability with our approach, by day <dig> of differentiation, fusion index was typically around 80 % . to maintain myotube integrity over several weeks, from day <dig> to <dig> of differentiation, a quarter of dm <dig> was replaced with fresh dm <dig> or dm <dig> at every third day of culture. there was little deterioration in myotube viability based on mitochondrial activity over 50 days of differentiation, and morphological appearance . myotubes transduced at day <dig> with replication-defective adenovirus expressing green fluorescence protein were found to persist in culture for at least 28 days of differentiation which demonstrated that the culture conditions applied were conducive to extended myotube survival, a requisite for myotube maturation . formed myotubes throughout the differentiation period manifestly possessed lateral striations characteristic of sarcomeres which remained visible throughout several rounds of myoblast passages .fig. <dig> enhanced myotube formation and viability. a present culture protocol conferred highly efficient myotube formation relative to typical cultures <cit> . about 80 % of fusion could be typically achieved by day <dig> of differentiation . b myotube mitochondrial activity as determined by mts assays remained relatively unchanged over a period of 50 days of differentiation. c from day <dig> of differentiation, 25 % of dm <dig> was replaced with dm <dig> every third day for extended myotube maintenance to at least day <dig> of differentiation . d porcine myotubes transduced with gfp-expressing non-replicating adenovirus at day <dig> remained largely intact at day <dig> of differentiation based on persistence of green fluorescence which was indicative of extended myotube survival in culture fig. <dig> myotube formation was accompanied by the observation of lateral striations indicative of sarcomeric structures. a myotubes at 4d, 5d, 9d and 42d of differentiation were immunostained for the presence of sarcomeric α-actin . b sarcomeric lateral striations were visible in h&e stained myotubes differentiated for 5d, derived from p <dig> and p <dig> longissimus dorsi myoblasts. bar = 50 μm for all panels extended myotube culture displayed phenotypic plasticity and postnatal phenotype an exciting observation made on extended myotube cultures over 28 days of differentiation was that the choice of dm could profoundly affect the profiles of myhc expression. despite absence of innervation, myotube cultures by 21 days in dm <dig> underwent fast phenotypic changes of raised fast myhc 2x and 2b expression which resembled the relative expression pattern of myhcs in longissimus dorsi muscle of a 22 week old pig . interestingly, testosterone was one ingredient identified by high throughput metabolomic analysis in the proprietary serum substitute ultroser g but its influence on postnatal myhc expression is unclear. the use of dm <dig> , by contrast, appeared to maintain a phenotype of sustained myhc embryonic and perinatal expression, and preferentially up-regulated the expression of the oxidative myhc slow and 2a genes . these results demonstrated the plasticity of myotubes in being able to undergo phenotypic changes in response to different culture media. furthermore, regular spontaneous contractions of myotubes were frequently observed throughout much of the extended culture period; contractions appeared earlier, more vigorous and extensive with the use dm <dig> additional movie files show contracting myotubes in dm <dig> or dm <dig> at <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and 60 day differentiation respectively. thus, with relatively simple but significant culture modifications, we were able to induce extensive myotube formation, and maintain myotube attachment and viability for several weeks of differentiation. these results were particularly gratifying as porcine myoblasts have been recognised to be least efficient amongst the commonly used host species to differentiate into myotubes <cit> .fig. <dig> extended myotube cultures exhibited phenotype plasticity and postnatal fibre phenotype. a full complement of pre- and post-natal myhc rna isoforms in myotubes at <dig> <dig> <dig> and 28 days of differentiation were quantified by real-time pcr . use of dm <dig> and dm <dig> resulted in divergent myhc profiles from day <dig> of differentiation. myhc profiles shown are a representative set of three independent experiments. b the use of dm <dig> but not dm <dig> promoted myotube transition towards a fast-glycolytic myhc profile that resembled postnatal longissimus dorsi muscle of a 22-week-old duroc pig. error bars = standard deviation; ** = p ≤ <dig> , *** = p ≤ <dig> based on two-sample unpaired t test at indicated time points rising putative linc-myh expression coincided with accumulation of myhc 2x and 2b in myotubes expression of the long intergenic non-coding gene, linc-myh, located in the 70 kb intergenic region between myh <dig> and myh <dig> of the skeletal myhc cluster, was recently shown to confer the coordinated adult fast-type and prevent the slow-type programme in murine tibialis anterior muscle <cit> . interestingly, the promoters of linc-myh, myhc 2b and 2x are controlled in common by a six1-dependent enhancer located at the immediate 5′-end of the linc-myh gene within the murine myh3-myh <dig> intergenic region <cit> . six <dig> a homeobox transcription factor, along with its cofactor eya <dig> also activates the adult fast-twitch and represses the slow-twitch programme in muscle fibres <cit> . by sequence alignment of the 73 kb porcine myh3-myh <dig> intergenic region with the murine linc-myh rna , we identified all <dig> putative porcine linc-myh exons at modest similarities of <dig> to 67 % with corresponding murine exons <cit> . we compared the expression of linc-myh, six <dig> and eya <dig> in our extended myotube cultures to determine their possible involvement in fast phenotype determination . beyond 10 days of differentiation, linc-myh expression was much more highly up-regulated in dm <dig> than dm <dig> which corresponded with the much higher expression of myhc 2x and 2b in dm <dig> myotubes . six <dig> and eya <dig> on the other hand, showed sharp reduction in expression from day <dig> of differentiation in both dm <dig> and dm <dig> cultures . linc-myh and six <dig> as predicted, were more highly expressed in the fast longissimus dorsi than slow psoas muscle of 22-week-old pigs . therefore, the fast postnatal myhc phenotype in extended dm <dig> cultures strongly correlated with enhanced linc-myh expression but not with six <dig> expression.fig. <dig> induction of linc-myh expression paralleled elevated expression of fast myhc 2x and 2b in myotubes. the expression of linc-myh , six <dig> and eya <dig> was determined by real-time pcr in extended myotube cultures in dm <dig> and dm <dig> , and skeletal muscles: fast longissimus dorsi and slow psoas . skeletal muscle data shown are the combined results of three sets of ld and ps from three 22-week-old pigs. error bars = standard deviation; * = p ≤ <dig> , *** = p ≤ <dig> , **** = p ≤ <dig> based on two-sample unpaired t test at indicated time point discussion the usefulness of myotubes in cultures to examine muscle gene regulation or response to external stimuli has hitherto been limited by the immature state of myotubes derived from a range of mammalian <cit> and avian <cit> species. most published experiments on myotubes are performed within about a week of differentiation, at a stage when adult myhcs are largely lacking. the principal reasons for this predicament are limited efficiency in myotube formation and continual loss of newly formed myotubes. the ability to culture myotubes long term in 2d to resemble the postnatal phenotype is of high biomedical value. the most important biomedical or veterinary muscle conditions all involve skeletal muscle in the postnatal fibre state. to have a suitable in vitro platform to examine such basic underlying changes is clearly advantageous. until now such a platform has been elusive in that myotube differentiation and maturation were major limiting factors. the present paper reports on such a technical breakthrough that promotes myotube differentiation and accommodates spontaneous myotube contractions without detachment which would facilitate the in vitro study of all aspects of postnatal muscle fibre biology. in the first weeks of postnatal development in rats and mice, there is typically progressive loss of embryonic and perinatal myhcs and accumulation of myhc 2a, 2x and 2b isoforms in designated fast fibre populations <cit> . our extended porcine myotube cultures in dm <dig> showed similar changes where reduction in embryonic and perinatal myhc expression was accompanied by dominant expression of myhc 2x and 2b . furthermore, the pattern of relative myhc expression at day <dig> and <dig> of differentiation in dm <dig> showed resemblance to the myhc expression profile of a 22 week old pig longissimus dorsi muscle <cit> . the divergence in myhc profiles between dm <dig> and dm <dig> is biologically significant as it demonstrated the expression plasticity of postnatal myhc genes through the use of different culture media. in vivo, early postnatal changes in myhc gene expression that lead to the formation of adult fibre types are dependent on the establishment of corresponding fast and slow motor units, load bearing after birth, and thyroid hormone surge in the case of fast myhc induction <cit> . the ability of our myotubes to adopt fast or slow myhc profile in the absence of innervation indicates that the choice of particular culture conditions is also an important phenotype determinant. dm <dig> myotube culture over several weeks recapitulated a fast-like postnatal pattern of myhc expression. we have therefore established a 2d culture platform that is conducive to the study of coordinated gene changes that govern fibre type and associated phenotypic alterations. acquiring a fundamental understanding of preferential up- or down-regulation of specific myhc isoforms in vitro could facilitate our ability to manipulate phenotypic changes in vivo for beneficial biomedical and veterinary outcomes. the present culture platform opens up a convenient controlled environment to investigate a range of mechanisms and factors that are involved in the coordinated expression of muscle gene isoforms, such as the roles of transcription factors like nfatc <dig> <cit> , micrornas , and anti-sense <cit> and linc <cit> rnas in the differential regulation of myhc and other fibre type-specific genes. we can systematically interrogate the role or effectiveness of individual genes or compounds on coordinated myhc isoform switching or myotube development. as an exemplification, we found that the fast glycolytic myotube phenotype of elevated myhc 2x and 2b expression closely mirrored the rising profile of putative porcine linc-myh rna expression but not with that of six <dig> and eya <dig> in muscle, on the other hand, the fast phenotype has been shown to correlate with the up-regulation of linc-myh <cit> and the presence or over-expression of six <dig> <cit> . our finding of an inverse relationship between linc-myh rna and six <dig> expression suggests that factors other than six <dig> could be responsible for the induction of linc-myh rna in growing myotubes. another research opportunity is to examine in vitro the role of thyroid hormone and other growth factors in the programming of fast phenotype to dissect the qualitative and quantitative changes of orchestrated gene expression during the transition <cit> . access to largely pure cultures of myotubes of a particular phenotype would also make the isolation of myonuclei and subsequent study of chromatin modifications much simpler than the use of whole muscle tissues. finally, extended myotube cultures would allow us to better scrutinise whether there are intrinsic differences in the conferment of myotube phenotype between satellite cells of fast and slow muscles from the same animal or between animals of different ages. CONCLUSIONS in conclusion, we have made a major technical breakthrough to be able to culture well differentiated porcine myotubes in 2d over an extended period of at least 50 days. furthermore, we showed that cultured myotubes could be made to adopt a fast adult phenotype of dominant myhc 2x and 2b expression. for the first time, to our knowledge, we are able to recapitulate the maturation process of myotubes in vitro, opening new opportunities to study coordinated postnatal muscle gene expression. additional files additional file 1: 4 day differentiation ld.avi. contracting myotubes in dm <dig> at 4 day differentiation. additional file 2: 8 day differentiation ld.mp <dig> contracting myotubes in dm <dig> at 8 day differentiation. additional file 3: 9 day differentiation ld.avi. contracting myotubes in dm <dig> at 9 day differentiation. additional file 4: 27 day differentiation ld.mp <dig> contracting myotubes in dm <dig> at 27 day differentiation. additional file 5: 60 day differentiation ld.wmv. contracting myotubes in dm <dig> at 60 day differentiation. abbreviations 2dtwo-dimension myhcmyosin heavy chain linclong intergenic non-coding 3dthree-dimension mc+maxgel coating mixture pmproliferation medium dmdifferentiation medium gfpgreen fluorescence protein ldlongissimus dorsi competing interests the authors declare no competing interests. zoetis inc. part funded the studentships of ss and lg. authors’ contributions kcc and ss conceived and initiated the project. kcc and svk supervised, designed and technically assisted ss and lg who jointly conducted all the experiments. all authors contributed to the writing and proof reading of the manuscript and approved its submission.",

RESULTS behaviour of l. brevis ioeb <dig> under simulated upper digestive tract conditions to test for ba production and the influence of active ba biosynthetic pathways on bacterial survival ioeb <dig> was grown to approximately <dig> × <dig> cfu ml- <dig> in mrs medium in the absence or presence of <dig> mm tyrosine or <dig> mm agmatine sulphate or both . then, the cultures were subjected to conditions that simulated some of the more important conditions of the human upper digestive tract, including treatment with lysozyme at ph <dig> and at a range of low ph in the presence of pepsin . acidity within the human stomach during digestion is in the range ph <dig> - <dig> which corresponds to the range of maximum activity of pepsin <cit> . however, during food ingestion, and depending on the food matrix, bacteria can be exposed to a broader ph gradient. therefore, during gastric treatment the bacteria were exposed to a decreasing range of ph from <dig> to <dig> , which we have previously used for testing of probiotic and lactic acid bacteria <cit> . ba production was quantified by reverse-phase hplc of culture supernatants, and cell viability was assessed by plate counting. under all conditions, production of tyramine and putrescine was observed in the presence of the corresponding precursor . the bacterium was sensitive to all conditions tested . the saliva simulation reduced the survival of ioeb <dig> to 34% in the control samples. a higher survival was observed in the presence of tyrosine, which was enhanced when agmatine was included in the assay. this survival-aiding influence of tyrosine was not previously observed with the dairy tyramine-producer e. durans <dig> <cit> , and as far as we know this is the first report indicating that functional ba biosynthetic pathways or presence of their precursors contribute to diminish damage of cell wall by lysozyme. the mechanism for this is unclear. tyramine and putrescine production were detected by rp-hplc during the saliva and gastric stress simulation in presence of <dig> mm tyrosine, <dig> mm agmatine or both. results are expressed in μm of ba produced by <dig> cfu ml- <dig> in <dig> min, they are the mean of three independent experiments and there are corrected for the cfu added to the experiment. putrescine and tyramine were below the detection limits in the uninoculated mrs and in absence of the corresponding ba precursor. differences were assessed by anova test. different superscript letters associated with values of the same ba indicate statistically significant differences . the pattern of increased survival was also detected under gastric simulation at ph <dig> and <dig> . below ph <dig> reduction of viability was marked. this reduction was qualitatively confirmed by confocal microscopy, after bacterial staining with syto <dig> and propidium iodide. an example is depicted in figure <dig> in cultures subjected to gastric stress at ph <dig> a mixed population of green and red were detected. moreover, the proportion of green cells was low in the absence of precursors and progressively increased in the presence of agmatine , tyrosine and both ba precursors . in addition, in untreated cultures only green cells were detected whereas only a few cells, most of them red were observed after exposure to gastric conditions at very acidic ph <dig> . the tyrosine decarboxylase of ioeb <dig> has an optimal ph of <dig> and is active between ph <dig> - <dig> in cell suspension <cit> . in agreement we found the highest levels of tyramine production under gastric stress in the range ph <dig> - <dig> . interestingly, significant concentrations of tyramine and putrescine were observed in the samples exposed to ph <dig> in the presence of the two ba precursors, even though only <dig> × <dig> cfu ml- <dig> were detected at the end of the assay. this suggests that the inoculum was able to synthesise a substantial quantity of tyrosine decarboxylase during the test before cell death and lysis occurred, and that probably the tyrosine decarboxylase remained substantially active in the dead cells and cell lysate. the tyrosine decarboxylase of ioeb <dig> is active in a range of ph <dig> - <dig> in cell-free extract <cit> . when we simulated the gastric environment, in addition to the action of lysozyme, the bacteria were subjected to multiple stress stimuli: decreasing ph, proteolytic activity of pepsin and heat shock at 37°c. griswold et al. <cit> , propose that the agdi operon could be part of a general stress response pathway in streptococcus mutans. the agmatine deimination, by forming ammonia and providing atp, would result in mild deacidification of the medium, metabolic energy release and degradation of toxic compounds <cit> . here, the maximum levels of putrescine production by l. brevis were observed between ph <dig> - <dig> for cultures supplemented with agmatine , which accords with that reported for lactobacillus hilgardii at ph <dig> <cit> and for streptococcus mutans at ph <dig> <cit> . there is evidence suggesting that ba production enables producing organisms to survive at low ph <cit> . our results show that at ph <dig> the presence of agmatine, tyrosine or both precursors enhanced the cell survival two-, three- and four-fold respectively compared to controls . at ph <dig> , the beneficial effect on viability was even more pronounced ; however, it has no beneficial effect at more acidic phs . thus, it seems that the beneficial effect of the putrescine and tyramine biosynthetic pathways is restricted only to mild acidic conditions. transcriptional analysis of tyrdc and agua <dig> genes the above results indicated that an increase of ba production occurred under saliva and mild gastric stresses, presumably due either to a physiological effect, or to increased gene expression. therefore, expression of the tyrdc and agua <dig> genes, encoding tyrosine decarboxylase and agmatine deiminase, the key enzymes for tyrosine and putrescine synthesis <cit> , were analyzed in exponential phase cultures prior to, or after, exposure to saliva and gastric stresses at ph <dig> or <dig> , in the presence or absence of ba precursors. transcriptional levels were calculated relative to the mrna levels of an unstressed sample for each condition tested, using the expression of the tuf gene as internal control . a similar pattern of expression for both genes was observed in unstressed and stressed samples for all conditions tested . mrnas corresponding to tyrdc or agua <dig> were induced only if the bacterium had been challenged with tyrosine or agmatine. under all conditions tested, higher levels of tyrdc and agua <dig> transcripts were detected when both bas precursors were present . furthermore, it should be noted that transcriptional levels of the two genes in the control cultures were not reduced under conditions of gastric stress. these results show a transcriptional induction of tyrdc and agua <dig> mediated by the respective ba-precursors under saliva and gastric stresses similar to that previously observed for ioeb <dig> under wine stress conditions <cit> . the increased transcription of both genes in the presence of tyrosine plus agmatine strongly suggests a previously undetected synchronous regulation of both ba pathways, which deserves further investigation. considering the overall results pertaining to ba production , cell survival and transcriptional analysis , it appears that induction of ba biosynthetic pathway at the transcriptional level by the presence of the ba precursor under mild gastric conditions results in increase of the bacterial survival. behaviour of l. brevis ioeb <dig> in the presence of human caco- <dig> intestinal epithelial cells our results revealed that at ph <dig> there is an approximately 35% survival of ioeb <dig> and an approximately <dig> % survival at ph <dig> . it is therefore possible, assuming ingestion of a high concentration ioeb <dig> that viable cells could be released from the stomach at the upper end of its normal ph range. therefore, binding ability as well as production of bas during co-incubation of ioeb <dig> with caco- <dig> cells was analyzed. caco- <dig> cells are human colonic adenocarcinoma cells that, after differentiation, have features characteristic of mature small intestine cells <cit> . the maximum adhesion levels were obtained within the ratios of 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> caco- <dig> cells to bacteria after <dig> h incubation, as we have also observed for other lab and bifidobacteria <cit> . figure <dig> depicts the results obtained with a ratio of 1: <dig> adhesion levels ranged from <dig> to 3% approximately, values similar to the two probiotic bacteria tested lactobacillus acidophilus la- <dig> and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb- <dig> . moreover, we did not detect any statistically significant influence of the ba precursors on the adhesion capability of l. brevis . logically, the ability to adhere to the epithelium of the small intestine could be an aid to colonisation. in addition, the bacteria could synthesize ba in the intestinal environment, and to test this hypothesis, the production of ba by ioeb <dig> in the presence of caco- <dig> cells was investigated. the bacterium was exposed to the cells at a ratio of 1: <dig> in dmem medium for <dig> h, in the presence or absence of the ba precursors, and the supernatants were analyzed by hplc. both ba were detected only when the precursors were present . levels of tyramine slightly increased in the presence of both bas precursors , and high levels of putrescine were observed irrespectively of tyrosine availability. enterocytes can both synthesize and take up putrescine <cit> , however, there was little production of the ba in the absence of the bacterium , although a high consumption of agmatine was detected , in agreement with the ability of epithelial cells to take up this compound without further metabolism <cit> . moreover, the absence of the human cells had little effect on putrescine synthesis by ioeb <dig> , in the presence of agmatine and tyrosine. in assays supplemented only with agmatine, a significantly lower level of putrescine was detected in samples containing only bacterial cells . these results indicate that the presence of caco- <dig> cells overcomes the need of tyrosine for full induction of the putrescine biosynthetic pathway of ioeb <dig> in dmem medium. finally, no synthesis of tyramine by caco- <dig> cells was observed in absence of bacteria and a slight but significant increase of the ba levels was observed in the presence of both precursors when either bacteria or co-cultures were analyzed. tyramine and putrescine were detected by rp-hplc in samples containing dmem medium supplemented or not with <dig> mm tyrosine, <dig> mm agmatine or both precursors, after <dig> h incubation. cells present during the assay: bacteria + human cells: l. brevis ioeb <dig> and caco- <dig> cells ; bacteria: l. brevis ioeb <dig> and human cells: caco- <dig> cells . results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. nd: not detected. detection limits: for put > <dig> nm and for tym > <dig> nm. putrescine and tyramine were below the detection limits in the dmem medium as well as in samples containing either bacteria or caco- <dig> cells in absence of the corresponding ba precursor. differences were assessed by anova test. different superscript letters associated with values of the same ba indicate statistically significant differences . comparison of l. brevis ioeb <dig> with enterococcus durans 655 in a previous study <cit> we studied the behaviour of enterococcus durans <dig> under saliva and gastric stresses as well as in presence of caco- <dig> epithelial cells using essentially the same conditions as described in this paper. our results reveal that the wine l. brevis ioeb <dig> like the dairy e. durans <dig> <cit> , was able to produce tyramine under saliva and gastric stresses as well as in presence of caco- <dig> epithelial cells. in addition, l. brevis was able to produce putrescine in all conditions tested. however, unlike e. durans <cit> an increase of bacterial survival under saliva and mild gastric stresses correlated with transcriptional activation of both ba biosynthetic pathways. moreover, we found that adhesion levels of l. brevis to caco- <dig> cells were between 2% and 3%, similar to that detected for e. durans <dig> <cit> . we did not detect any influence of the ba biosynthetic pathways on l. brevis adhesion capability. however, we have only observed for l. brevis an increase of putrescine production in co-cultures of bacteria and epithelial human cells. thus, it seems that the role of the ba biosynthetic pathways of lactobacillus in the human git environment differs from that of enterococcus. potential impact of l. brevis ioeb <dig> on human health with regard to the potential impact of l. brevis on human health, our results indicate that during transit through the stomach as well as in contact with caco- <dig> cells the bacteria could produce around <dig> mm tyramine . this should not be harmful for healthy individuals, since an average of <dig> mg of orally administrated tyramine is required to increase systolic blood pressure <cit> . however, tyramine can be particularly toxic to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors. gastrointestinal mao is essential for the breakdown of tyramine and it has been reported that as little as <dig> mg of tyramine is sufficient to produce hypertension in humans treated with mao inhibitors <cit> . ethanol also inhibits mao. thus the expected low toxic effect due to low levels of tyramine produced by l. brevis during wine fermentation could be potentiated by the simultaneous ingestion of high ethanol content beverages. moreover, the production of putrescine by this bacterium could be also harmful. the polyamines, including putrescine, play a role in the maturation of the intestine, even when administrated orally <cit> . polyamines administrated orally can act as growth factors with beneficial or detrimental effects, depending on their concentration <cit> and there is evidence suggesting that putrescine can cause malignancy in git cells <cit> . it is estimated that the daily intake of polyamines in the diet is in the range of 350– <dig> μmol. thus, the amount of putrescine produced by l. brevis in <dig> h <dig> min in the gastric environment seem to be of little concern. however, the <dig> - <dig> mm production of putrescine in the presence of caco- <dig> epithelial cells during <dig> h, is more worrying, especially if l. brevis is able to colonize, even transiently, the small intestine. CONCLUSIONS l. brevis ioeb <dig> produced both tyramine and putrescine under all conditions in an in vitro model that simulated the normal physiological conditions in the human digestive tract, as well as in the presence of caco- <dig> epithelial cells. under mild gastric stress bacterial survival improved in the presence of ba precursors and a synchronous transcriptional activation of the tyramine and putrescine biosynthetic pathways was detected. these results suggest that ba production may be a mechanism that increases bacterial survival under acid stress. the results also indicate that it may be possible for viable cells of l. brevis ioeb <dig> to pass from the stomach into the duodenum. l. brevis ioeb <dig> cells were able to adhere to caco <dig> cells, which suggests that they may be able to adhere to human intestinal epithelium. however, this would not necessarily guarantee that l. brevis ioeb <dig> would colonise the lower intestine as the impact of competition with other resident microorganisms, and the gut's innate defence mechanisms has not been assessed for this organism. high levels of both ba were observed after exposure of the bacterium to caco- <dig> cells.",

    "prompt": "Generate a concise overview of symptoms and treatment plans. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND it is well known that transcription factors exert their regulatory function in a combinatorial and cooperative way <cit> . this is particularly true for higher eukaryotes where simple and general arguments borrowed from information theory show that combinatorial interactions among tfs is a mandatory consequence of the lack of information of their binding sequences <cit> . thanks to the recent advances in chip-seq technologies and in particular to the so called re-chip experiments <cit> , it is now possible to address cooperative interactions among tfs in a quantitative way. an interesting open problem in this context is to understand the evolutionary mechanisms which led to clustering of binding sequences of the “right” tfs in the regulatory regions of target genes. while it is easy to create a single binding sequence by point mutation, the appearance of a combination of several binding motifs in an extended region of dna is definitely more unlikely in this way. indeed, it is difficult to understand how a local evolutionary process could create an extended combination of binding sequences. a possible solution of this apparent paradox is to assume that a suitable template for the sought combination of motifs already exists in the genome and is then transferred as a whole in the regulatory region of the target genes. transposable elements are the natural candidates to play this role <cit> . in agreement with the above observation, in the last few years several chip-seq analyses have shown that tes in the human genome are significantly enriched with transcription factor binding sites <cit> . this was shown for various master tfs and, among others, for erα, which is the main focus of our paper. it is interesting to notice that this association with tes persists even when a total affinity approach is used to reconstruct the transcriptional regulatory network <cit> . this association between tfs and tes suggests that transposition events could have played a central role in the emergence and success of combinatorial gene regulation in complex eukaryotes. according to this hypothesis, when a te with a “good” combination of binding sequences is transposed near the regulatory region of a target gene it is “exapted” <cit> and then conserved by evolution. stochastic mutation of the original transposable sequence can then fine tune the regulatory module by eliminating or adding suitable binding motifs. indeed there is clear evidence that several te families are under strong purifying selection <cit> and that most of the known cnes are located inside tes <cit> . bioinformatic tools can only identify the most recent exaptation events, for which the underlying te can be recognized. an extreme version of this hypothesis would suggest that also the regulatory regions for which no te structure is visible are actually the modern remnant of ancient exaptation events, in which the underlying te structure was deleted by evolution. a consequence of this picture is that, due to continuous transposition events, the regulatory network of higher eukaryotes is characterized by an extensive and fast rewiring of regulatory interactions <cit> . in this paper we test this picture relative to a specific case of inducible tf, that is the estrogen receptor α . besides looking for tes enrichments and transcription factor binding sites correlations we also sought to understand if the binding pattern of erα varies as a consequence of the kind of experimental activation of erα. erα plays a central role in the development and function of mammary glands and other sex hormone-regulated districts and is a key molecular player in most human breast cancers. indeed, antiestrogenic drugs are among the most widely and successfully used treatments since long time. in vitro stimulation of human breast cancer derived cell lines with 17β-estradiol evokes rapid and massive binding of erα to the genome and regulation of transcription of thousands of genes <cit> and consequently stimulates proliferation. however, these cell lines are made proliferating also by continuous culture in so-called “complete medium” that contains low level estrogen derived from the <dig> to 10% fetal calf serum added to this medium. these two modalities represent “chronic” exposure to low doses versus “acute” exposure to elevated levels of hormones and may represent two extreme modalities for cells to respond to the hormone, which display both common and specific erα binding sites. it should also be stressed that human reproductive biology is quite different from other mammals in terms of cycling of hormones. estrogen receptor binding sites profiling of breast cancers is associated with the clinical outcome under antiestrogen treatment, further suggesting that estrogen concentration may correlate with changes in binding sites <cit> . for all these reasons erα is a perfect candidate to test our proposals. on these grounds, we present here a comparative analysis of erα binding sequences in chronic versus acute stimulation, in order to seek for common or differential te enrichment and tfbss composition. RESULTS in order to test our proposals we analyzed two publicly available datasets corresponding to the two conditions described above <cit> . details on the datasets are available in the methods section. we report here the results of a set of enrichment tests performed on these data. details on the tests are also available in the methods section and in the additional file <dig> erα preferentially binds dna within particular classes of te sequences in both cm and e2t conditions. while some of the selected tes are enriched in both conditions, a few of them are specifically enriched only in cm or e2t datasets. we show the results of our enrichment test in figure 1a for the “cm” dataset <cit> and in figure 1b for the “e2t” dataset <cit> . 1a and figure 1b. top pies: single tes; bottom pies: classes; left pies: cm dataset; right pies: e2t dataset. the very high levels of enrichment observed prove that erα preferentially binds dna within a few specific families of tes both in cm and in e2t conditions. this confirms previous results for erα reported in <cit> and agrees with what already observed for p53 <cit> , pou5f <dig> also known as oct4 <cit> , sox2 <cit> , c-myc <cit> , nanog <cit> and stat1 <cit> . examining results in more detail, we see that the tes are not all on the same ground and that the highest enrichment scores are reached for a few selected te families. this suggests that besides a general affinity for the given te class, erα is able to perform a fine-tuned selection and shows a specific affinity for a few well-defined small families of tes within the class. this remarkable selectivity allowed us to perform a detailed analysis of the combinatorial regulatory patterns involving erα and to identify a few putative new co-regulators. our results suggest that each particular te family within a given class should actually correspond to a different combinatorial regulatory pattern. as far as the difference between the two datasets is concerned, when comparing the enrichment scores we clearly see a twofold pattern. the erv-like tes are enriched in both datasets while the mir-like tes show a preferential enrichment in the e2t dataset. in order to test this observation further we performed the same enrichment analysis separately for the three groups of sequences: i) intersection of the two datasets, ii) the binding events present only in the cm dataset and iii) the binding events present only in the e2t dataset. the results are reported in table <dig> and nicely confirm the previous results. in the first part of the table are reported tes which are enriched in at least one of the two datasets used for the analysis. in the first five columns we report the z-score for the five possible combinations of the two datasets: cm, e2t, cm only = cm\\ e2t, e2t only = e2t\\ cm and the intersection of the two datasets. in the last five columns the absolute number of instances of each enriched te in each one of the five combinations of the datasets. in the second part of the table we report the same information for the classes of tes enriched in both the datasets used for the analysis. we see two possible explanations for the different behaviour in the two datasets. they correspond to different experimental settings: the e2t dataset corresponds to an acute, sudden exposure to elevated concentration of 17β-estradiol, while the cm dataset corresponds to cells that are grown in a steady state situation of low estrogen concentration. therefore, either i) the two different exposures to estrogen likely correspond to different concentrations of the estrogen receptor in the nucleus, thus making it possible that also binding sequences with a lower affinity to the receptor are bound in the dataset with the highest concentration; or ii) continuous versus pulse estrogen exposure would result in different concentration and activity of cofactors known to play a crucial role in fine tuning the binding of erα to its target sequences. most of the enriched classes of tes predate the human-mouse separation but a few of them appeared in the last <dig> myrs and induced a rewiring of the human regulatory network with respect to the murine one. an interesting feature of the above results is that most of the enriched te families are rather old transposons. this is particularly true for the mir-like sequences, whose amplification is known to predate the mammalian radiation <cit> . in the case of the erv-like sequences the time window is slightly larger. tes belonging to the ervl class, which is the largest class of erv sequences, and is enriched in both our datasets, ceased their activities only <dig> myrs ago <cit> , while tes belonging to the ervk class are definitely younger. a tentative estimate of their mean age gives numbers ranging from <dig> myrs up to <dig> myrs <cit> . even if it is widely accepted that these tes are no longer active, examples of very recent ervk insertions exist <cit> . in any case it is clear that most of the ervk insertions occurred after the new world/old world monkeys split. thus it seems that, as far as these tes binding sequences are concerned, a twofold picture exists also for the network rewiring. a large portion of the erα regulatory network underwent a dramatic rewiring at the beginning of the mammalian radiation but then it stabilized, and is now shared by all the mammalians. this obviously does not exclude local changes and possibly also transposition events after the mouse/human divergence, but suggests that these should not be the rule and that a massive rewiring of this subnetwork in the last <dig> myrs should be excluded. finding evidences of this conservation by a direct comparison of the human and mouse sequences is very difficult because most of these ancient tes are too corrupted to be identified. nonetheless, by combining the syntenic maps and the te annotations of the human and mouse genomes downloaded from the ensembl database <cit> we were able to single out, among the tes bound by erα in our datasets, several pairs of conserved trasposons . these examples are of particular interest since the very fact that they could be identified suggests that a large portion of the te sequence should be under purifying selection and, therefore, they may represent important regulatory sequences. as expected from the above discussion, most of the conserved tes belong to mir-like classes with a few notable exceptions like mer <dig> mer31a and mer <dig> which are known to be among the oldest erv-type tes. among the tes enriched in our dataset belonging to the mir family, a fraction between 15% and 25% of the tes was conserved between human and mouse. we then looked for putative regulated genes of these conserved mir-like te’s . we found several putatively regulated genes and, remarkably enough, most of them turned out to be important known targets or cofactors of erα. in particular, among the regulated genes, we found greb <dig> which is known to be regulated by er and to be involved in estrogen-responsive breast cancer ; rarα, which is a known cofactor of erα <cit> ; tap/sec14l <dig> which is known to be downregulated by er in breast cancer cells <cit> ; glut1/slc2a <dig> whose expression in the luminal epithelial cells of the uterus was shown to be regulated by erα <cit> and is involved in the erα mediated response to hypoxia <cit> and several other erα regulated genes like anxa6 <cit> , fyn <cit> , ca12 <cit> , cyp1b1 <cit> , krt13 <cit> and prkaca <cit> . these findings suggest that also some of the remaining genes targeted by conserved tes could be involved in erα regulated pathways and that this combination of chip-seq and evolutionary conserved tes could be in general a powerful tool to identify reliable targets. on the contrary, the portion of the regulatory network that is activated in cm conditions, which is strongly enriched in ervl and ervk insertions, most probably underwent a significant rewiring in the last <dig> myrs. however, note that, as above, also in this case one cannot exclude local cases of convergent evolution or that part of these insertions simply correspond to non-functional bindings, thus mitigating the rewiring effect of the erv-like transposons expansion. mir-like and erv-like tes targeted by erα are preferentially located near the tss of regulated genes in order to support the idea that the mir-like and erv-like tes in the peak datasets have a regulatory role, we identified their chromosomal localization and measured their distance from the transcription start site of the nearest gene. results of this analysis are reported in figure 3a for mir-like tes and in figure 3b for erv-like tes. we see that in both cases the tes nicely peak around the tss. the pattern is very similar in the two datasets and supports our suggestion that these tes were indeed exapted by the estrogen receptor and are likely to play a regulatory role in driving the response to estrogen stimulation. tes selected by erα are enriched for binding sequences of tfs representing known cofactors of erα. our approach allows the identification of new putative cofactors in order to exert its regulatory functions, erα very often interacts with other tfs. in particular, clear evidences of regulatory interactions with foxa <dig> rarα, gata <dig> sp <dig> and ap <dig> have been recently observed . in order to test whether these interactions are mediated by tes and in particular by those that are enriched in the two datasets, we evaluated the transposon affinity score value for each tf. results are reported in additional file 2: table s <dig> and s <dig> separately for the two datasets . remarkably enough, most of the known cofactors of erα listed above have a tas value above threshold in at least one of the enriched tes . moreover the same procedure allowed us to identify a few combinatorial patterns associated to selected classes of tes, thus supporting our suggestion of a tes driven combinatorial organization of transcriptional regulation. these data allowed also the identification of several other putative cofactors for which, as far as we know, experimental evidences like those mentioned above for foxa <dig> rarα, gata <dig> sp <dig> and ap <dig> are still missing. in figure <dig> we report the heat-maps showing the fraction of enriched transposable elements in the datasets which carry given computationally predicted transcription factor binding sites. yellow corresponds to low fractions, blue to high fractions. in the figure we also report the hierarchical clustering of both tes and tfs. these heat-maps are probably the best representation of the “transposon code” mentioned above: each column corresponds to a different te and the blue spots along the column to the particular combination of tfbss brought about by that particular te. well defined combinatorial patterns involving tes belonging to the same class can be recognised in the heat-maps. their organization is made more explicit by the hierarchical clusterings reported along the sides of the heat maps. smaller versions of these maps, involving only the most important known cofactors of erα can be found in the additional material . selection of combinatorial patterns using our “transposon affinity score” has evolutionary implications. a tas value above 10% is likely to occur only if the te contained in its ancestral sequence one or more subsequences similar to the tfbs under study. if we accept this assumption then the tas value measures the fraction of such ancient subsequences modified by evolution to become tfbss . tfs enriched in the datasets, and in particular the known erα cofactors, tend to be simultaneously present and to appear at fixed distance in the tes that we studied. a possible objection to the above statement is that simultaneous enrichment does not necessarily imply that the two tfbss are simultaneously present in the same te instance. to address this issue, for each set of tes we looked for correlators of tfbss at fixed distance along the sequence, i.e. we counted how many times a pair of tfbss occurs exactly at a distance d along the te sequence. we report the results of this analysis in additional file 2: table s <dig> an interesting example is plotted in figure <dig> for the case of err and gata- <dig> as can be seen from figure <dig> this correlation function has a very sharp peak at a fixed distance. this behaviour is typical of most of the identified correlators and agrees with a set of recent observations showing that tfs cooperation, to be effective, requires tight spacing patterns between the tfs. both in the cm and in the e2t datasets a putative err binding site is associated to gata- <dig> at a fixed distance of <dig> bp in the context of mer41a/b tes. these tes also host other important correlations: for example brca <dig> with e2f- <dig> and rarα with gata- <dig> . thus we see that two of the tes showing the highest level of enrichment in our datasets host a collection of tfbss located at a fixed distance among them, whose relative position seems to be carefully conserved by evolution. this example is interesting also for another reason. brca <dig> is characterized by a pwm with a very low information content and for this reason we could not single it out in the enrichment analysis described in the previous section. the same happened also for other tfs with similar scarcely informative pwms. this problem is completely overcome by the correlation analysis discussed here, which is much more constrained and allows precise identification of tfs even when they display scarcely informative pwms. the genes of our datasets regulated by particular classes of tes show a non trivial enrichment with respect to a few gene ontology categories to further support these results, we searched if genes connected to specific tes are enriched for specific go categories, following the procedure discussed in the methods section. we performed this analysis both on the whole set of enriched tes and separately on the subset of tes conserved between human and mouse. results of the analysis are reported in additional file 2: tables s <dig> and s <dig> for the whole set of enriched tes and in additional file 2: tables s <dig> and s <dig> for the subset of conserved tes. we found several interesting results. a few of them are clearly related to the expected function of estrogen, like “cell-cell signaling” or “secreted” , but a few others, which present rather strong functional enrichment are new and could suggest new functions driven by selected classes of tes. interesting examples are gtpase regulator activity , regulation of ras protein signal transduction or keratin . in particular, this latter category, which is enriched in the e2t dataset and is strongly associated to the mer <dig> te, suggests that this particular class of tes could play a critical role in remodeling cell morphogenesis, a key process in mammary gland differentiation <cit> . in agreement with this observation, it is very interesting to notice that this specific te is enriched in e2-treated dataset suggesting a link with increasing level of estrogen during pregnancy. discussion general considerations on the regulatory role of tes there are by now several evidences of the important regulatory role played by tes. for instance in <cit> a few examples of tes playing the role of enhancers are discussed. in <cit> the authors showed that alu <cit> and line <cit> are enriched in tf binding sequences. the authors of <cit> using the fantom <dig> data found more than <dig> candidate, te-derived regulatory regions. more recently one group <cit> discussed the role of tes in organizing and modeling ctcf binding in mammals and others <cit> have shown the central role of mer <dig> to associate with tfs that control gene regulatory network for pregnancy in placental mammals. given the importance played in our analysis by these classes of tes, we shall concentrate here in particular on the evidences supporting the widespread regulatory role of mir-like and erv-like transposons. mir-like transposons, which are specifically enriched in e2t cells, play an important regulatory role in mammals a few recent results strongly support the idea that mir-like transposons should play important roles in gene regulation in mammals. it was shown in <cit> that the mirb family is overrepresented in mammalian cnes . a te belonging to the mirb family was shown to play a crucial regulatory role in the reelin signalling pathway, which allows neurons to complete their migration in the developing brain <cit> . a set of mir <dig> and mirb tes were demonstrated to regulate immune response genes <cit> . mir <dig> and mirb share a common core of <dig> bps which is strongly conserved in human and mouse <cit> . it was suggested a few years ago that this remarkable conservation could have a regulatory origin and that this shared <dig> bps core could contain the binding sequences of several dna binding proteins <cit> . our results suggest that erα could be one of these tfs. to test this hypothesis we aligned all the instances of this conserved core in the mir-like tes that we found in the two datasets. then we analyzed the aligned “core” sequences using both jaspar and transfac binding matrices. we found at the very beginning of the core sequence a high score half-ere, followed in many cases by other instances of the same binding sequence. moreover in a few cases we found examples of point mutations with respect to the reference core sequence which led to the creation of additional high score half-ere sequences. these point mutations seem to be positively selected in the dataset . the results of the analysis are reported in additional file 5: figure s <dig> in which we report in the top line the reference core sequence and then list in each of the following lines one of the instances of the core that we found in our chip-seq datasets. for each of them we report in bold face the nucleotides which are conserved with respect to the original core sequence; in red colour the half-ere binding site, in blue colour the ap <dig> binding site and green is for roralpha binding site. examples of exaptation of erv-like tes erv-like tes are probably the class with the largest number of known exapted instances with regulatory function. at the same time erv-like tes are known to be preferential targets of several important tfs. for instance, it was shown in <cit> that erv <dig> is the class of tes with the highest affinity for oct <dig> nanog. in this respect our analysis suggests that erα and a few erα related tfs should be added to this list. this idea is also supported by the analysis of the distance from the tss of the nearest genes reported in figure <dig> showing that erv-like tes targetd by erα are preferentially located in the vicinity of the tss and are thus likely to have a regulatory role. an interesting feature of erv-like tes is that, since the erv expansion occurred in a rather large time window, there are several examples of primate specific ervs. this represents a major difference between erv-driven and mir-driven regulation. a list of examples of erv exaptation as promoters can be found in <cit> . all the examples listed in <cit> are not present in mouse and therefore are expected to have been exapted in the last <dig> myrs. from these examples a few general considerations emerge: erv-like tes are usually exapted as alternative promoters, their main role being to ensure tissue specifity of gene expression <cit> . in several cases after exaptation the erv-derived promoters become the primary promoter. in most cases these new promoters have only moderate effects on gene expression. a notable exception to this trend is represented by placental genes. in these cases erv-derived promoters have a very strong effect and are essential for the expression of the regulated genes in the placenta <cit> . as for the function of these erv-derived promoters, it appears that they play a particularly important role in the regulation of placental development <cit> , an observation in good agreement with our analysis, showing that erv-like tes are enriched in erα and erα-related tfbss. another very interesting and nontrivial example is given by prolactin regulation. a genomic instance of the mer <dig> te regulates the expression of endometrial prolactin which is essential for pregnancy both in rodents and in human in a primate specific way. remarkably enough the role played by this mer <dig> in human is played by another te in rodents . we see in this example the competition between rewiring and evolutionary pressure which has driven the exaptation of different but functionally similar tes in different species leading to this very nice example of convergent evolution <cit> . our results support a driving role of tes in the appearance of combinatorial regulation in complex eukaryotes we have shown that a few classes of transposons are strongly enriched among the erα targets and that these host the binding sequences of several known interactors of erα. from these observations emerges that tes played a crucial role in the evolution of the regulatory network of higher eukaryotes, not only by rewiring the network, as already observed in various papers <cit> , but also by allowing an easy implementation of the combinatorial rules. the emerging paradigm is that tes may be considered as templates of pre-organized combinations of binding sequences which can then move around in the genome carrying an already prepackaged combinatorial regulatory information which can subsequently be fine tuned by local evolutionary moves according to the specific needs of the target genes. all these considerations support the idea that particular classes of repetitive features had a central role in the diffusion of specific combinatorial patterns of regulation on a genomic scale. this idea nicely agrees with the recent observation that waves of tes expansions had a central role in modeling ctcf binding location in mammals <cit> . this is coherent also with the work of <cit> who have shown that mer <dig> contributed in a significant way to create the gene regulatory network important for embryo implantation key events of placental mammals. in our study we have found that mer <dig> enriched to erα binding site upon estrogen treatment, is near keratin cluster genes suggesting that this specific te class may play a role in mammary gland differentiation, in addition to placental development. pushing these considerations to their extreme to consequences, it is tempting to guess that combinatorial regulation was actually made possible by the appearance of transposable elements which had a driving role in the creation and organization of the combinatorial scheme of transcriptional regulation which we observe today. at the same time our analysis suggests that when a specific association between a tf and a class of transposons exists, then the evolutionary success of this tf could be related to the evolutionary success of the associated transposon. in this respect the association between estrogen receptor and mir-like transposons represents a perfect example. a tf very similar to the estrogen receptor exists also in very distant species like mollusks <cit> , however in these organisms it has a very limited role. it is only at the beginning of the mammalian radiation that this ancestral steroid receptor underwent a set of duplications, giving rise to all the family of mammalian steroid receptors and their role became essential in mammalian development and reproduction. it is tempting to relate this impressive evolutionary success with the simultaneous expansion of mir-like transposons which, as we have shown here, are preferential targets of erα and erα-related tfs. it is important to stress that in the case of erα a crucial condition for the success mentioned above was the evolution of the ligand-binding ability. the origin of this ability is still a debated issue <cit> with two main opposing hypothesis “the ancestral receptor” model and the “ancestral orphan” one. in this respect it is interesting to notice that mir-like transposons are especially enriched in particular in the e2t dataset, which corresponds to acute exposure to estrogen where er-binding intensity increases. even if this observation by itself does not allow to distinguish between the two scenarios, it shows that transcriptional specificity for mir-like tes and ligand-binding ability are deeply connected and suggests that the appearance of mir-like transposons could be exactly the event allowing to combine the two abilities and at the same time to drive the genome-wide expansion of erα transcriptional activity. a possible objection to this picture is that, even if statistically enriched with respect to a random reshuffling, the overall number of mir-like peaks in our datasets is only a small portion of the total number of peaks . it is not obvious that they could really influence the functional evolution of erα. indeed it is well possible that other evolutionary mechanisms, still to be understood, played a role together with mir-like tes in shaping the functions that the estrogen receptor has acquired in these last <dig> myrs. however it is important to notice that the above percentages increase to higher values if we consider the fraction of chip-seq peaks containing simultaneously erα and one or more of its most important cofactors, like foxa <dig> rarα or ap <dig> . this agrees with the idea that combinatorial organization of the regulatory interactions made erα evolving its functions and that this combinatorial organization was more likely mediated by tes. it would be very interesting to extend these observations to other classes of tes and to other tfs. it is becoming increasingly clear that tfs can be classified as a function of their age and that in some cases they acquired their regulatory role in a precise time window of the evolutionary process. it would be interesting to test if also in this case it is possible to associate these tfs to precise transposon classes and to relate their evolutionary success to the expansion of the associated transposon class. CONCLUSIONS in this work we sought to better understand the role of transposable elements in shaping the regulatory network of higher eukaryotes. several papers appeared in these last years on this topic and it is by now well understood that tes contributed to a substantial rewiring of the regulatory network of complex eukaryotes. in this work we add another piece of information to the picture looking at the role of tes in the emergence and diffusion of combinatorial transcriptional regulation. the rationale behind this study is that while it is easy to create a single binding sequence by point mutation it is difficult to understand how a local evolutionary process could create an extended combination of binding sequences. a possible solution is to assume that a suitable template for the sought combination of motifs already exists in the genome and is then transferred as one in the regulatory region of the target genes. to test this idea we focused on a particular transcription factor: the estrogen receptor alpha and, using two different sets of chip-seq data, performed a set of enrichment tests on the te distribution within the datasets. we found that erα preferentially targets a well defined set of tes and that these tes host combinations of transcriptional regulators involving several of known co-regulators of erα. moreover, a significant number of these tes turned out to be conserved between human and mouse and to be located in the vicinity of important estrogen-related genes.",

kilobases in the genome, that negatively regulate gene expression by targeting mrnas due to sequence complementarity, thereby inducing transcript degradation and/or translational inhibition <cit> . a single mirna shows complementarity to hundreds or thousands of different transcripts, an ability which gives mirnas the potential to act as central regulatory nodes in gene co-expression networks <cit> , thereby modulating and providing stability to complex biological processes involving several interconnected signaling pathways such as aging. in recent years, specific mirnas that regulate different aspects of the aging process were identified <cit> . several mirnas were described to be significantly up- or down-regulated with age, both in invertebrate and vertebrate species <cit> , some micrornas influence lifespan and/or predict longevity in invertebrate models and one of these regulates functional heart aging in mammals <cit> . microrna- <dig> family members were shown to be upregulated during normal aging in the central nervous system of different vertebrate species such as fish <cit> , mice , monkeys <cit> and humans <cit> . moreover, mir- <dig> appears upregulated in klotho-deficient mice <cit> , a model of premature aging, and progeroid mouse model zmpste24 –/– <cit> . in mammals, the mir- <dig> family is present as two distinct genomic clusters that are both ubiquitously expressed and are particularly enriched in the cns <cit> , specifically in mature neurons <cit> . mutant mice lacking both clusters do not present evident abnormalities at birth, but they rapidly accumulate defects during post-natal development and die within 6 weeks <cit> . mice lacking only one cluster , thus retaining residual mir- <dig> activity, reach adulthood, display an ataxic phenotype, a mild loss of purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and die around 9 months of age <cit> . a similar cerebellar phenotype is induced by knock-down of mir- <dig> in adult rodents <cit> . on the other hand, up-regulation of mir- <dig> protects neurons against apoptosis during neuronal maturation, forebrain cerebral ischemia and stroke by targeting pro-apoptotic members of the bcl- <dig> family . interestingly, the mir- <dig> family was found to target beta-site app-cleaving enzyme mrna and to be downregulated in sporadic alzheimer’s disease <cit> . all these data indicate that mir- <dig> plays a protective role in neurons and reduced mir- <dig> activity in adult life has detrimental effects. iron is an element required for multiple fundamental biological processes such as mitochondrial atp generation, dna replication and synthesis of heme, myelin and dopamine <cit> . while iron is an essential micronutrient, it also represents one of the most powerful sources of oxidative damage. indeed, intermediates of oxygen reduction, including h2o <dig> and superoxide, are potent oxidants in the presence of fe2+ and their reactions with fe2+ form hydroxyl radicals, which cause cytotoxicity primarily due to lipid peroxidation <cit> . this, along with the evidence that iron accumulates in several tissues with age , supports the prevailing opinion that age-dependent iron accumulation contributes to the aging process by increasing oxygen reactive species production, which over time causes extensive mitochondrial and cellular dysfunction <cit> . consistently, dietary iron supplementation reduces lifespan and accelerates age-dependent protein aggregation in c. elegans <cit> . instead, reduced iron absorption increases longevity in flies <cit> and iron chelant therapy reduces oxidative stress in worms <cit> . iron responsive proteins and their binding sites in mrnas constitute an iron sensing system that tightly regulates intracellular iron homeostasis by post-transcriptional regulation of key genes involved in iron uptake, storage, export and utilization <cit> , thus strongly influencing the energy production and redox status of cells. irp <dig> is particularly enriched in the cns and it appears to play a preeminent role in the regulation of intracellular iron homeostasis within the cns <cit> . indeed, alteration of irp <dig> alone, but not of irp <dig> alone, induces iron imbalance and iron-mediated toxicity in neurons <cit> . despite the central role of irps in regulating iron homeostasis, little is known as to their regulation during aging and whether their altered expression contributes to the age-related decline. it is known, however, that downregulation of transferring receptor, a direct target of irps, is among the most robust transcriptional markers of aging <cit> . here, we investigated the role of mir- <dig> during adult life in the short-lived turquoise killifish nothobranchius furzeri﻿﻿ . this is the shortest-lived vertebrate that can be cultured in captivity and has emerged as model organism to study vertebrate aging. its aging is characterized by an exceptionally short lifespan of 4– <dig> months , age-dependent cognitive decline, and expression of age-related phenotypes at the molecular, cellular, and integrated level . in particular, genome-wide transcript regulation patterns during aging are similar in n. furzeri and humans <cit> and mir- <dig> is upregulated during n. furzeri aging <cit> . it therefore represents an ideal model to investigate how a perturbation of mir- <dig> expression affects aging. we generated a transgenic line with neuronal specific mir- <dig> loss of function and analyzed genome-wide transcript regulation by rna-seq to compare the perturbations induced by mir- <dig> loss with those induced by aging. RESULTS mir- <dig> is up-regulated with age in neurons and is negatively-correlated with expression of its targets we searched the killifish genome <cit> for mir- <dig> members and found three distinct mir- <dig> genomic clusters referred to as pri-mir- <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> . each cluster contains two mir- <dig> mature members, mir-29a is contained in all clusters paired with mir-29b or either of two novel mir- <dig> family members that we provisionally refer to as mir-29d and mir-29e . all of these mirnas share the same seed sequence, but differ in their 3′ ends. thus, we tested whether all three clusters exhibit an age-dependent transcriptional regulation by rt-qpcr. we found that all clusters are actively transcribed; however, one is expressed at much higher level and also shows the largest age-dependent up-regulation, increasing its expression more than <dig> times between <dig> and 27 weeks of age . to assess the impact of mir- <dig> on global age-dependent gene expression, we took advantage of combined rna-seq and mirna-seq data from n. furzeri brain at five ages <cit> and considered all protein-coding genes with rapid age-dependent decay in expression . this gene set was enriched for genes containing a mir- <dig> binding site as predicted by miranda < <dig> , fisher’s exact test). in addition, mir- <dig> targets showed an excess of negative correlation with mir- <dig> expression as opposed to non-targets . these data suggest that mir- <dig> is a regulator of age-dependent gene expression, as previously reported in the prefrontal cortex of humans and macaques using similar methods <cit> . since one mir- <dig> primary transcript shows much higher expression than the other two, we focused our investigation on this cluster and used in situ hybridization to define its expression domains in the adult n. furzeri brain. it is intensely expressed in the periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum and in the granular cell layer of cerebellum , where it is co-localized with the neuronal marker huc/d, thereby confirming the neuronal expression of mir- <dig> originally reported in the mouse <cit> .fig. <dig> mir- <dig> is

cerebellum overview picture shows a clear and strong expression of pri-mir-29- <dig> just in the granular cell layer , it is instead absent in the purkinje cell and molecular layer . scale bar 100 μm genetic repression of mir-29 we generated transgenic zebrafish and n. furzeri overexpressing a competitive mir- <dig> inhibitor and evaluated the global effects of mir- <dig> antagonism on gene expression in adult life. we used a well-established strategy by fusing to the egfp cds a 3′-utr bearing seven repetitions of a mir- <dig> binding site to generate a transcript that scavenges endogenous mir- <dig> . as a first step, we tested whether mir-29-sponge mrna was directly targeted by mir- <dig> family members by co-injecting its mrna along with rfp control mrna and mir- <dig> mimics into zebrafish embryos. at 24 hours post-fertilization , injected embryos were dissociated and the relative egfp/rfp fluorescent ratio in dissociated cells was measured by fluorocytometry . a strong repression of egfp signal was induced by mir- <dig> mimics . we further generated a transgenic zebrafish line where mir-29-sponge expression was controlled by <dig> kb of d. rerio actin beta <dig> promoter tg to evaluate the biological activity of sponge- <dig> in vivo. for this purpose, we took advantage of the extremely low expression of mir- <dig> during the first 2 days of embryonic development <cit> and injected increasing doses of mir-29a or mir-29b mimics both in wild-type and in tg zebrafish embryos. both mimics induced similar effects in wild-type embryos and 200 pg of mimic were sufficient to induce overt morphological defects like brachyury, microcephaly, and microphthalmia. the percentage of defective embryos induced by mir- <dig> mimics was much lower in the tg line . to assess the effects of sponge- <dig> on gene regulation, we injected doses that were not inducing morphological defects and analyzed two well-validated mir- <dig> targets: elna <dig> and col11a1a , both highly expressed in embryos and bearing in their 3′-utr four and two predicted target binding sites, respectively . we observed a dose-dependent down-regulation of these transcripts in wild-type, but not in tg injected embryos . all these data support the notion that genetically modified fish with stable sponge- <dig> overexpression counteract mir-29-induced gene regulation in vivo. since pri-mir-29- <dig> is mainly expressed in neurons, we decided to antagonize mir- <dig> activity specifically in neuronal cells and evaluate the effects on global gene expression. to this end, we isolated from zebrafish genomic dna a <dig> kb fragment of the neuronal specific promoter dre-kif5aa , thus generating the transgenic line tg. this kif5aa promoter fragment was sufficient to maintain the expression of egfp-sponge- <dig> throughout life both in zebrafish and n. furzeri. since zebrafish life expectancy is about 5 years <cit> , we decided to generate a stable line in the short-lived turquoise killifish in order to more rapidly investigate the consequences of mir- <dig> depletion during adult life. to this end, we used the mzm- <dig> strain with a median lifespan of approximately 7 months <cit> . n. furzeri f <dig> fish exhibited a stable expression over time and a double labeling with egfp and huc/d proved the neuronal specificity of the expression pattern . we did not observe any macroscopic defect, but did observe a reduced fertility and reduced post hatch survival, which limited the number of animals that could be analyzed. it should be noted that a full knock-out of mir- <dig> is postnatally lethal in the mouse <cit> , so reduced viability is expected and the fact that some transgenic fish reached adulthood could be due to the incomplete antagonism of mir- <dig> by sponge- <dig> fig. <dig> generation of mir- <dig> loss of function n. furzeri. a scheme of the reporter assay for mir- <dig> activity. green fluorescent protein mrna carrying multiple

20-week-old killifish brain section mir- <dig> antagonism mimics aging-induced gene regulation in n. furzeri brain we analyzed the global gene expression profile in f <dig> sponge- <dig> transgenic fish through rna-seq. our previous rna-seq analysis of transcriptome regulation during aging in the turquoise killifish brain showed that the most relevant change in global gene expression occurs between <dig> and 12 weeks <cit> . here, we decided to compare the expression profile of 12-week-old transgenic fish with 12-week-old wild-type fish, using four biological replicates for the experimental group. we detected <dig> differentially-expressed genes . kegg pathway analysis revealed an over-representation among up-regulated genes of terms involved in energy production processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and tca cycle as well as ribosome biogenesis, lysosome, phagosome, and endoplasmic reticulum functions and downstream p <dig> effectors and an overrepresentation among down-regulated degs for terms involved in biosynthesis and catabolism of biomolecules, extracellular remodeling, circadian rhythm and the following pathways: jak-stat, mapk, wnt, and notch . several of these pathways were previously reported to be regulated in the n. furzeri brain during aging . remarkably, the majority of these pathways showed the same direction of regulation during aging and in response to mir- <dig> antagonism and only a minority showed opposite directions of regulation . moreover, in a longitudinal study of n. furzeri, baumgart et al. <cit> reported that a higher expression of genes belonging to the oxidative phosphorylation, phagosome, lysosome, ribosome biogenesis, and rna transport pathways is negatively correlated with lifespan. on the other hand, higher expression of extracellular matrix-receptor interaction genes is positively correlated with lifespan <cit> . therefore, our results indicate that mir- <dig> antagonism induces an up-regulation of those pathways negatively correlated with lifespan , with the exception of rna transport and spliceosome pathways and a down-regulation of the only pathway positively correlated with lifespan . among up regulated degs, we found <dig> genes negatively correlated and <dig> positively correlated with lifespan ; among down-regulated degs, we found <dig> genes negatively correlated and <dig> positively correlated with lifespan . we interpret these data as a signature of accelerated aging. to corroborate our hypothesis, we compared the effects of aging and mir- <dig> antagonism at the individual gene level. we intersected the sets of degs of sponge- <dig> transgenic fish and aging . the intersection contains <dig> genes and <dig> show the same direction of regulation in aging and mir- <dig> sponge . of those, <dig> are up-regulated and <dig> are down-regulated in both conditions . only <dig> genes showed opposite regulation: <dig> down-regulated in sponge- <dig> and up-regulated during aging and <dig> with the opposite behavior . furthermore, we assessed the expression profile of genes with a conserved predicted binding site for mir- <dig> to this end, we retrieved a list of d. rerio <dig> predicted targets from targetscanfish <dig> <cit> . out of those, <dig> genes were degs in kif5a: sponge-29 n. furzeri fish; <dig> up-regulated and <dig> down-regulated . a total of 22/28 n. furzeri ortholog up-regulated genes exhibited a conserved binding site . for 10/ <dig> the mir- <dig> predicted binding site was conserved also in the mouse and human orthologs and for <dig> of these an interaction with mir- <dig> was observed also by cross-linking immunoprecipitation -seq . among these, we found genes involved in epigenetic reprogramming , dot1-like, histone h <dig> methyltransferase , enhancer of polycomb homolog <dig> ), glutamate metabolism ), and igf <dig> signaling ), consistent with the known biological actions of mir- <dig> reported in the literature. curiously, among the down-regulated degs, we found well-known mammalian mir- <dig> targets such as ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase <dig> , dna -methyltransferase 3ab , and collagen type iv alpha <dig> . thus, we examined the effect of aging on conserved mir- <dig> predicted targets. of <dig> up-regulated targets, 6/ <dig> are type <dig> genes and 12/ <dig> were not regulated by aging, indicating that those mir- <dig> could directly influence their expression by regulating transcript stability. on the other hand 4/ <dig> up-regulated targets and 9/ <dig> down-regulated targets were type <dig> and type <dig> genes , i.e., showed the same direction of regulation during aging and in response to mir- <dig> antagonism, indicating that, for these genes, the global effect of mir- <dig> depletion on aging-dependent gene expression is prevalent over the target-specific effect of mir- <dig> fig. <dig> mir- <dig> antagonism partially recapitulates aging. a, b kegg pathway overrepresentation analysis on degs . the red and black asterisks indicate categories of degs regulated with age in the brain . red colored asterisk indicates

intersection shown in . pie chart represents the fraction of genes coherently or incoherently regulated by aging and sponge-29 mir- <dig> affects iron homeostasis via regulation of irp2 the observed transcriptomic signature of accelerated brain ageing induced by mir- <dig> antagonism is likely due to dysregulation of multiple pathways. however, kegg pathway analysis retrieved a consistent overrepresentation of terms related to energy production processes, in particular mitochondria processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and tca cycle. further, among type- <dig> genes, i.e., genes normally downregulated during aging but up-regulated in sponge- <dig> transgenic fishes, we noticed genes that have a key-role in the regulation of iron homeostasis or heme synthesis such as transferrin , transferrin receptor , the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin , and the heme transporter scl22a <dig> since iron is a key-molecule for mitochondria activity and energy production and iron imbalances have profound implications in the aging-induced dysfunctions and lifespan extension <cit> , we supposed that this specific process may contribute to the accelerated aging phenotype observed upon mir- <dig> loss of function. the dysregulation of tfr1a is particularly interesting for at least three different reasons: trf1a is the primary carrier responsible for iron import, its expression is much higher in neurons than in glial cells in vivo <cit> , and a meta-analysis of microarray studies identified tfrc as the gene with the most robust age-dependent downregulation across multiple tissues and mammalian species and it is considered as part of a common transcriptional signature of aging <cit> . we therefore investigated the presence of possible mir- <dig> binding sites in mrnas coding for genes involved in iron homeostasis and noticed the presence of an 8 nt seed sequence in the 3′-utr of the iron-responsive element binding protein <dig> mrna that is conserved across vertebrates . accordingly, both miranda <cit> and targetscan <cit> retrieved ireb <dig> mrna as a target for mir- <dig> in both fishes and mammals. in addition, starbase supports a physical interaction of mir- <dig> and ireb <dig> 3′-utr in human and mouse <cit> . the ireb <dig> gene encodes for the protein irp <dig> that, along with irp <dig> is considered a master regulator of intracellular iron homeostasis. to demonstrate a direct regulation of ireb <dig> mrna by mir- <dig> in fishes, we isolated the 3′-utrs of ireb <dig> from zebrafish and n. furzeri cdna and fused either of them with the egfp coding sequence to generate a reporter construct; 100 pg of each reporter mrna were co-injected in fertilized zebrafish embryos in combination with the same amount of control mrna encoding for the red fluorescence protein and 100 pg of dre-mir-29a or dre-mir-29b mimic. control embryos were injected with the same mixture omitting the mirna mimics. at <dig> hpf, 30– <dig> injected embryos were digested and cell fluorescence was analyzed by cytofluorimetry to assess the relative egfp/rfp fluorescence ratio. for both 3′-utrs, the normalized egfp fluorescence was significantly reduced in the presence of mir- <dig> mimics . for both constructs, a mutation of three nucleotides in the putative target sequence of the 3′-utrs abolished repression . in addition, we performed a luciferase assay in the human hek293t cell line to demonstrate direct targeting of ireb <dig> 3′-utr by mir- <dig> in mammals. mir- <dig> decreased luciferase activity of a reporter containing mouse ireb <dig> 3′-utr and repression was abrogated by mutation of three nucleotides in the putative binding site . given the direct interaction between mir- <dig> and ireb <dig> we tested whether ireb <dig> expression is reduced during aging. the variations in ireb <dig> expression are not significant at the level of mrna, but are significant at the protein level . to investigate the impact of ipr <dig> downregulation, we analyzed the age-dependent expression of mrnas coding for its direct targets: tfr1a, scl11a <dig> fth1a, and slc40a <dig> . consistently with irp <dig> downregulation, expression of transferrin receptor and the solute carrier transporter 11a <dig> gene, directly involved in intracellular iron delivery, decreased with age . on the other hand, transcripts coding for ferritin heavy chain and ferroportin , genes required for iron storage and discharge, were not significantly regulated . specific age-dependent downregulation of intracellular iron delivery genes is likely a direct result of iron accumulation, as the same specific regulation was observed in mammals <cit> . to directly demonstrate iron accumulation during normal aging, we quantified brain non-heme iron concentration using a colorimetric assay <cit> in fish of five age groups: at <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and 39 weeks. these age steps correspond to sexual maturity , young adult stage , median lifespan , and exceptional survivors . from <dig> to 39 weeks of age, non-heme iron amount increases almost 10-fold in fish brains . this datum was corroborated by histochemical pearl’s staining with dab intensification on brain sections. increased labelling was apparent both in gray and white matter of 39-week-old fish . in mammals, iron loading negatively regulates irp <dig> by inducing cytosolic fbxl <dig> accumulation that in turn induces irp <dig> proteasomal degradation. since iron accumulates during aging, we would expect to observe an age-dependent fbxl <dig> up-regulation along with irp <dig> reduction but neither fbxl <dig> mrna nor its protein were significantly modulated by age . thus, the observed age-dependent downregulation of irp <dig> cannot be mediated by fbxl <dig> but could be mediated by mir- <dig> we therefore quantified the expression of irp <dig> and tfr1a in brains of wild-type and tg fish at young adult stage. both proteins were found up-regulated in sponge- <dig> lines compared to control animals . in addition, we analyzed the regulation of irp <dig> over time in fish overexpressing mir- <dig> sponge and found no significant reduction over time as opposed to the clear age-dependent regulation observed in wild-type fish . finally, we tested in zebrafish embryos whether mir- <dig> overexpression represses tfr1a expression by microinjecting <dig> and 150 pg of mir- <dig> mimic in wild-type and tg embryos. no significant ireb <dig> mrna downregulation was observed , but a significant reduction of tfr1a mrna was observed in wild-type embryos but not in tg embryos .fig. <dig> mir- <dig> family targets ireb <dig> mrna. a presence of a putative binding site for mir- <dig> family in the ireb <dig> mrna 3′-utr sequence in

quantification of lipofuscin density based on percentage of area over threshold, n = <dig> overall, these data strongly indicate that mir- <dig> is responsible for age-dependent downregulation of irp <dig> in neurons that, in turn, reduces tfr1a expression. as a proof of principle that mir- <dig> could exhibit a conserved regulation of iron homeostasis also in mammals, we evaluated the expression of mir- <dig> and iron management genes during post-natal development in the mouse brain. a dramatic up-regulation of mature mir- <dig> members during the first 2 months of postnatal life was already described <cit> . we tested whether mir- <dig> increase correlates with ireb <dig> and tfr1a downregulation. using rt-qpcr, we quantified the expression of both mir- <dig> primary transcripts in postnatal day <dig> and p <dig> mouse cerebral cortex. both increased their expression more than <dig> times while ireb <dig> tfr1a, and scl11a2/dmt <dig> were significantly downregulated . in addition, during the preparation of this manuscript, papadopulous et al. <cit> reported that mice lacking one locus for mir- <dig> show up-regulation of ireb <dig> lending further support to a direct regulation of irp <dig> expression by mir- <dig> in vivo. neuronal-specific overexpression of irp <dig> leads to mitochondria damage and pervasive oxidative stress <cit> . therefore, we assessed iron content and histochemical markers of damage in the sponge- <dig> transgenic line. non-heme iron content was significantly increased as compared to wild-types at age 12 weeks . to assess whether increased iron induced oxidative stress we analyzed lipofuscin, an autofluorescent pigment that is primarily composed of cross-linked protein residues, generated by iron-catalyzed oxidative processes <cit> . lipofuscin deposition was quantified in the periventricular grey zone of the optic tectum, a brain region composed by tightly packed neuronal somata and that shows a strong expression of mir- <dig> and was significantly increased in the sponge- <dig> line as compared to wild-type . finally, gliosis was assessed as a nonspecific reactive change of glial cells in response to neuronal damage. increased immunoreactivity for the glial markers gfap and s100β was observed . our data indicate that mir- <dig> upregulation with age reduces irp2-tfr1a axis in neurons thereby reducing intracellular iron delivery and limiting iron-mediated neuronal damage. iron loading induces mir- <dig> in neurons to study the effects of iron on expression of mir- <dig> in neurons we employed murine stem-cell derived telencephalic neurons in vitro <cit> . incubation of murine neurons with either fe or fe-dextran induced an up-regulation of mir- <dig> . we then induced acute iron overload in adult fish by parental injection of 350 μg per gram of weight of fe-dextran and monitored brain iron concentration and mir- <dig> expression up to 3 days post-injection . iron significantly accumulated in the brain <dig> hpi reaching a maximum at 8– <dig> hpi to slowly decrease . we observed a delayed and significant increase of both the prevalent mir- <dig> primary transcript and mir-29a mature form, following the injection, starting at <dig> hpi and reaching its maximum at <dig> hpi . in addition, iron overload caused up-regulation of mir- <dig> also in liver and muscle , suggesting a systemic effect. we then asked whether physiological steady-state levels of iron influence mir- <dig> expression by injecting i.p. 30 μg/g of the iron chelant deferoxamine . at <dig> hpi, brain iron amount was reduced by 25% , we did not aim for stronger reduction of iron since this can have serious negative consequences on physiology. we monitored pri-mir-29- <dig> expression at <dig> <dig> and 72 hours after dfo injection and did not detect any differences despite reduced iron levels , suggesting that lowering iron below physiological levels does not regulate mir- <dig> finally, we replicated the iron-overload experiment and, after 4 hours, administered dfo. delayed chelation of iron significantly reduced pri-mir- <dig> up-regulation .fig. <dig> iron overload induces mir- <dig> up-regulation

after iron overload and in combination with administration of 30 μg/g of dfo, control animals were injected with saline solution , n = <dig> biological replicates. for all the graphs, mean ± standard errors of means are reported our results suggest that iron amount affects mir- <dig> expression; however, since the delay between mir- <dig> increases and iron-overload, we consider that intracellular events triggered by iron increase and not iron directly are responsible for up-regulation of mir- <dig> discussion here, we report the first case of modulation of neuronal aging by a mirna in a vertebrate species. neuronal-specific mir- <dig> loss of function induces accelerated expression of aging phenotypes both at the global gene expression level and the histological level. age-dependent up-regulation of mir- <dig> is conserved among different vertebrate species and different tissues. with our work, we show that, in fish, mir- <dig> is expressed in mature neurons as previously shown in mice, a robust negative correlation between expression of mir- <dig> and its targets is observed during adult life, as previously shown in primates <cit> , and mir- <dig> loss of function has detrimental effects, as previously observed in mammals both in physiological <cit> and pathological contexts such as ischemia <cit> , cancer <cit> , thymus involution <cit> , and inflammatory response <cit> . therefore, mir- <dig> upregulation appears to be an evolutionary conserved aging signature that provides an advantage in opposing aging-induced dysfunctions. this hypothesis is further supported by the observation that mir- <dig> is upregulated in a mouse model of progeria <cit> . in addition, during killifish aging, mir- <dig> is upregulated also in liver, skin <cit> , and heart . consistently, mir- <dig> is reported to be upregulated in several tissues in aging mammals as well . thus, mir- <dig> upregulation appears to be a common aging mechanism across different tissues. these data also lead to the general concept that part of age-dependent gene regulation is adaptive and protective. indeed, a recent study showed that out of <dig> conserved genes that are down-regulated with age in nematode worms, fish, and mice, <dig> cause life extension when experimentally down-regulated in the worm <cit> and it was previously shown that mir- <dig> is upregulated with age in fruit fly and its overexpression is life-extending while the knock-out is life-shortening <cit> . although we did not investigate the molecular mechanism underlying age-dependent mir- <dig> upregulation, here we observed that mir- <dig> loss of function leads to increased iron deposition in the adult killifish brain and that, in turn, acute iron loading induces mir- <dig> upregulation in brain, liver, and muscle. in this respect, it should be noticed that age-dependent iron accumulation was observed in several organisms such us c. elegans, d. melanogaster <cit> , mice <cit> , primates <cit> , and humans <cit> . in mammals, iron increase is observed in several tissues, such as brain, heart, muscle, liver, skin, kidney, and spleen, and it appears to be a robust aging hallmark. however, our data also demonstrate that mir- <dig> does not respond immediately to an acute increase iron concentrations, but with a delay of 2 days. we therefore speculate that age-dependent accumulation of iron-mediated damage might represent the stimulus that triggers mir- <dig> upregulation during aging. further, we report that mir- <dig> regulates irp <dig> expression directly and antagonism of mir- <dig> abrogates age-dependent repression of irp <dig> in neurons, which is very likely the cause of increased iron accumulation in the brain of the sponge- <dig> line. in fact, irp <dig> is an rna-binding protein that acts as master regulator of intracellular iron availability in the brain, influencing both the energy production and the redox status of the cell. similarly to mir- <dig> irp <dig> in enriched in the cns. within the cns, different cell types express iron management genes at different levels due to differences in their iron requirement and utilization. for instance, neurons express high levels of tfr1a and low levels of ferritin which, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in astrocytes and microglia <cit> . indeed, the neuronal-specific expression of tfr1a reflects their high-energy metabolic rate, while the relative low ferritin expression suggests that, as opposed to astrocytes, iron storage is negligible as compared to iron usage by mitochondria and other metabolic processes. moreover, neuronal restricted expression of mitochondrial ferritin in the mammalian brain further supports this consideration <cit> . in addition, in rodents, the highest neuronal iron consumption seems to occur during perinatal development and coincides with neuronal maturation and myelin synthesis <cit> ; subsequently, neuronal iron demand decreases along with tfr1a mrna expression. due to the low cytosolic iron storage capacity of neurons, a small increase in iron loading may result in mitochondrial iron accumulation and significant changes in the mitochondrial redox status. thus, modulation of tfr1a expression is crucial for redox status homeostasis in neurons. in fact, our work revealed that mir- <dig> increases in aging reduce irp <dig> and tfr1a levels, therefore limiting excessive intracellular iron delivery and protecting neurons from iron-mediated toxicity. although irp <dig> simultaneously regulates several iron-management genes, neuron-specific loss-of-function of mir- <dig> results in a significant modulation of tfr1a, but not of cytosolic fth1a nor of scl40a <dig> suggesting that neurons might regulate iron homeostasis primarily through modulation of tfr1a. since expressions of fth1a, scl40a <dig> and fbxl <dig> – all linked to cytosolic iron – were stable during aging, we speculate that iron might accumulate primarily in the mitochondria causing mitochondrial dysfunction and that this effect is exacerbated by mr- <dig> knockdown. our hypothesis is supported by the up-regulation of energy production pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation and tca cycle in the sponge- <dig> line and by the direct demonstration that irp <dig> upregulation induces mitochondrial iron accumulation in human lung cells <cit> . moreover, la vaute et al. <cit> showed that irp2-deficient mice exhibit neurodegeneration linked to cytosolic iron accumulation in gray and white matter. deficiency of irp <dig> increases the expression of the iron storage protein ferritin and reduces the expression of the transferrin receptor leading to functional iron deficiency and therefore neuronal death. the same team reported a markedly reduced activity of mitochondria complex i and ii as a consequence of iron starvation <cit> , and galy et al. <cit> reported that correct mitochondria iron supply requires irp <dig> in mouse liver. all these data indicate that an important function of irp <dig> is to control mitochondrial iron homoeostasis, thereby preventing iron starvation. our work integrates this view, identifying a novel mechanism of irp <dig> regulation, mediated by mir- <dig> that contributes to the prevention of iron-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. a direct relation between aging and iron homeostasis was reported also by klang et al. <cit> , showing that dietary iron supplementation significantly accelerates the onset of aging-related phenotypes, reduces the lifespan expectancy and increases the age-dependent protein aggregation in ﻿c. elegans﻿. strikingly, tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation proteins are the most enriched proteins in the iron-induced aggregates. conversely, the sponge- <dig> lines exhibited up-regulation of the same categories at the transcript level. overall, these data suggest two important considerations: the transcriptional up-regulation of tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation proteins in response to mir- <dig> loss-of-function represents a compensatory response to iron-induced damage of mitochondrial protein. up-regulation of these categories is therefore a marker of compromised mitochondrial functionality and of accelerated aging. consistently, baumgart et al. <cit> showed that increased expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes negatively correlates with killifish lifespan. iron accumulation compromises mitochondrial activity, corroborating the observation that age-dependent iron accumulation occurs primarily in the mitochondria and that mir- <dig> might promote mitochondrial integrity through regulation of iron homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS age-related damage accumulation is an inescapable condition that tends to change cellular homeostasis; on the other hand, cells tend to maintain their homeostasis inducing a progressive and adaptive response in order to counteract this inevitable process and preserve their physiological functions. age-dependent up-regulation of mir- <dig> is part of this adaptive response and its deficiency leads to exacerbation of aging-induced damage , partly due to impaired iron homeostasis.fig. <dig> schematic model of mir- <dig> action in brain aging. during aging an accumulation of iron in neurons occurs. this induces expression of mir- <dig> that in turn represses expression of irp- <dig> thereby limiting iron uptake. this mechanism counteracts aging-related damages. mir- <dig> may also counteract effects aging-related phenotypes by additional mechanisms, for example modulation of pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family members <cit>",

eukaryotic genomes. generally, microsatellite loci are assumed to be selectively neutral <cit> . however, increasing evidence now suggests that microsatellites are associated with important roles in genome structure and evolution and are often subjected to selective pressure <cit> . moreover, non-random genomic distributions of microsatellites are well documented in eukaryotes <cit> . as much as 25% of the microsatellites are localized close to each other, generally within 10 bp, in different eukaryotic genomes as found by kofler et al. <cit> . furthermore, kofler et al. <cit> showed that these microsatellites are localized close to each other in the genomes at a higher frequency than expected under the assumption of random genomic distribution. in addition, simple sequence coding sequences are distributed differentially in the genomes as evident from analysis of <dig> insect species <cit> . also, the mouse genome sequencing consortium, <cit> has revealed that the ends of chromosome arms in mice are associated with higher density of microsatellites than other chromosomal regions. however, the functional and evolutionary relevance of non-random genomic distribution of microsatellites is poorly understood <cit> . studies have indicated possible association of microsatellites with segmentally duplicated sequences in some organisms <cit> . segmental duplications , also known as low-copy repeats, are generally defined as dna sequences of length greater than 1 kb which are duplicated with high degree of sequence identity <cit> . sds are important features of genomes as they may have functional consequences in genomic instability and diseases as evident in humans <cit> . sds are generally found in the genome as mosaic forms of duplicated sequences <cit> . a two-step process generates such mosaic structures <cit> . in the first step, multiple duplicated sequences are aggregated at specific genomic regions. in the second step, these primary duplications undergo multiple secondary duplications. however, the mechanism of how duplicated sequences are aggregated in the first place is not clear. the present study is a systematic investigation to determine the distribution of microsatellite sequences in segmental duplications of different insect genomes . although microsatellites are extensively used as genetic markers for population and ecological investigations of insects <cit> , the relationship of microsatellite sequences with segmental duplications has not been established in spite of availability of several insect genome sequences. here we show that specific microsatellite pairs along with the intervening sequences are repeated with different frequencies in the genome and many of the low copy repeats of these loci are segmentally duplicated, henceforth called as microsatellite-associated sds or msds. the results further show that these repeated microsatellite pairs tend to aggregate at different genome regions along with the segmentally duplicated sequences suggesting a role for microsatellites in segmental duplications in insect genomes. methods insect genomes a total of <dig> insect genomes were investigated in this study. they included twelve drosophila species , three mosquito species , the wasp , the honey bee , the beetle , the silk worm and the pea aphid . the insect names have been abbreviated as the first letter of the genus followed by three letters of the species names throughout the text and the illustrations. the genome sequences of the twelve drosophila species were downloaded from flybase . the genome assembly version for each of these was r <dig> except d. melanogaster , d. pseudoobscura and for d. virilis . the genome sequences of the three mosquitoes were downloaded from vectorbase . the a. mellifera genome sequence was downloaded from http://hymenopteragenome.org/. the nasonia genome sequence was obtained from http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu. the aphid genome sequence was obtained from the aphidbase . the silkworm genome sequences were obtained from the silkdb . the genome sequence of t. castaneum was obtained from the beetlebase . non-random association of microsatellite pairs the sciroko software <cit> was used to identify the mono-, di-, tri-, tetra- and hexa-nucleotide simple sequence repeats or microsatellites in each genome. both perfect and imperfect ssrs were detected by using the default parameters, with fixed penalty = <dig> for mismatches between motif sequences. from the output files of sciroko , distances between neighboring microsatellites were calculated in each species. when two microsatellites of the same repeat motifs had the same intervening distance at more than one location, they were counted as repetitive microsatellite pair . we assumed that presence of microsatellite pairs with the same motifs and same intervening distance at multiple locations in a genome was due to a random chance. test of this null assumption was performed by calculating statistical significance of the hypergeometric probability as follows. first, the number of microsatellite pairs associated with the same intervening distance but different ssrs and the number of pairs associated with the same ssr pairs but with different intervening distances was determined in each genome. the total number of possible combinations for these two groups of ssr pairs was calculated as c* c, where ‘n’ is the total number of microsatellites identified in the genome minus one , and ‘c’ represents the function of combination. thus, c was calculated as the number of possibilities for choosing the ‘n1’ pairs from all the detected microsatellites in a genome. of these, c was calculated as the number of possibilities for choosing the same ssr pairs with the same intervening distance . thus, the number of combinations of the same ssr pairs having different intervening distance was calculated as c. from these, the cumulative probability of hypergeometric distribution of ssr pairs with the same intervening distance was calculated as p=∑1n3−1cn,n1×cn,n3×cn−n <dig> n2−n3cn,n1∗cn,n <dig> thus, 1-p value provided the statistical significance to reject or not to reject the null assumption. the multiple testing by bonferroni correction method was conducted to adjust the individual p values. the threshold values less than <dig> were considered statistically significant unless stated otherwise. the association was further tested in shuffled sequences of a. aegypti supercontigs. here we assumed that the distribution of ssr pairs was independent of the sequence structure of the genomic sequences and hence sequence shuffling would not affect their distribution. to test this assumption, the supercontig sequences were shuffled and sampled using the r code ‘shuffleandextract’ . the sequences generated from three independent shuffling experiments were then analyzed separately for distribution of rmps using hypergeometric tests as described above. a canonical correlation test <cit> was performed using the number of rmps associated with different intervening distances among the <dig> species. euclidean distance measures were used in the correlation test and significance of correlation was determined by permutation test according to methods of anderson and willis <cit> . intervening sequences of paired microsatellites the intervening dna sequences of the paired microsatellites were extracted using the coordinates of the microsatellite ends in the genome sequences by the r package seqinr <cit> or the galaxy server . the pair-wise alignments of duplicated sequences and the percent sequence identity of the alignments were performed using the r package ‘biostrings’. the phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the neighbor-joining method in mega <dig> <cit> . the evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method <cit> and were in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. the estimates of average evolutionary divergences between different groups of rmp loci were also calculated by mega <dig> all the sequence polymorphism analyses including calculation of total number of mutations, number of polymorphic sites, the average number of nucleotide differences among duplicated sequences, and significance of tajima d statistics were conducted by dnasp v <dig> <cit> . to determine the genomic distribution patterns of paired microsatellites, genome assemblies were binned to determine the total number of rmps and the total number of pairs as msds. the size and number of bins were variable depending upon the chromosome length but they were mostly in megabases . for example, the a. gambiae genome was binned as < 1 mb, 1–5 mb, 5–10 mb, 10–20 mb, 20–30 mb, 30–40 mb, 40–50 mb and > 50 mb for each chromosome. the total numbers of rmps and the msds across individual windows were counted. the spearman rank order correlation test was performed with the total number of rmps and the total number of msds among the binned regions to determine if regions rich in paired microsatellites accumulated more segmental duplications than regions poor in paired microsatellites. the p-value < <dig> was considered significant. association of msd sequences with gene duplications and transposons the genomic positions of msds were used to determine if they were localized in genic regions. the start and end coordinates of annotated genes of each genome were used to determine if msds were localized within or overlapping with the genes. the gene ontology terms of the genes associated with msds were analyzed. the rank orders of go terms were used to determine the top ranking functions of these genes. the orthology and paralogy relationships of insect genes were obtained from biomart database. based on sequence identity between paralogous copies, the nearly identical paralogs <cit> were identified. the transposable element sequences annotated from d. melanogaster were analyzed to determine association of msds with transposable elements. the te sequences were downloaded from ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/aaa/transposable_elements/reas/v1/consensus_fasta/. the start and end coordinates of tes in relation to msds were analyzed to determine te-msd associations. RESULTS identification of repetitive paired microsatellites the microsatellite sequences were identified in a genome-wide manner among the <dig> insect species that included three mosquitoes, twelve drosophila, honey bee, silkworm, beetle, wasp and pea aphid. the total number of microsatellites and the genomic density are shown in table <dig> for each species. collectively, the microsatellite sequences represent <dig> – <dig> % of the assembled genome size of these insects. the frequencies of mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide ssrs in each of the <dig> genomes are provided in additional file <dig> the entire list of microsatellites and their positions in the genome assembly of all the <dig> species are available upon request. the species names are listed as four-letter abbreviations. based on the position of microsatellites in the genome, it was observed that specific microsatellite pairs are localized together with the same intervening distance at multiple locations in each genome . we identified these repetitive microsatellite pairs in each insect genome comprehensively. the list of all rmps in the d. melanogaster genome is provided in additional file <dig> but the lists of rmps of all the <dig> genomes are available upon request. it was found that in each genome the frequency of rmps varies depending upon the intervening distance of the paired microsatellites . table <dig> shows that rmps of 10 bp to 1 kb in size are predominant in all the genomes. it also shows that the rmps with length greater than 5 kb are present only in specific species. although some rmps are up to 50 kb in length, none of the rmps in any genome has an intervening distance greater than 50 kb. on the other hand, rmps of smaller sizes were relatively high in frequency in these insects . the intervening distance groups between the microsatellite pairs are shown as the heading . the distance groups exclude the upper boundary. species names are four letter abbreviations. non-random distribution of microsatellite pairs we assumed that microsatellites with the same intervening distance are localized as pairs at different locations in the genome by random chance. based on the number of paired microsatellites with same and/or different sequences and intervening distance, the distribution of the rmp represents a hypergeometric distribution as illustrated in figure <dig> we performed hypergeometric tests with bonferroni correction as described in methods to determine if microsatellite pairing is a random or non-random event. the results revealed that many of the rmps are distributed in non-random manner in the insect genomes. they account for <dig> - 67% of the total number of rmps identified in the genomes. the motif sequences of the most repetitive microsatellite pairs for each species are shown in figure <dig> to further validate the result, we shuffled the genomic sequences of a. aegypti and repeated the hypergeometric tests on rmp distribution in the shuffled sequences. we didn’t find a significant correlation in the distribution of rmps in the shuffled sequences . it was found that ~ 96% of the rmps identified from the shuffled sequences showed random distribution pattern and lacked statistical significance after the bonferroni correction. this suggested that the genomic distribution of microsatellite pairs is not due to a random chance but may be a characteristic feature of the genome structure of the organism. inter- and intra-chromosomal distribution of rmps the inter- and intra- chromosomal repetition of microsatellite pairs were investigated in selected species where chromosome assignments of genome sequences are available . it was found that the inter-chromosomal duplications are generally more frequent than intra-chromosomal duplications . however, in chromosome x and 2l of d. melanogaster, rmps are duplicated more often within chromosomes than between chromosomes. in d. melanogaster and a. gambiae, many chromosome specific rmps were identified . these duplications are restricted to either x chromosome or autosomes but never shared by both sex chromosome and an autosome. the a. gambiae genome contains ~ <dig> fold greater number of such sequences than that of the d. melanogaster genome. however, the frequencies of these chromosome specific rmps are relatively lower compared to frequencies of rmps shared by both sex and autosomes. furthermore, it was found that the shared rmps may be selected differentially between the sex chromosome and autosomes. for example, the rmp n-1022 bp-n is repeated <dig> times and shared between autosomes and the sex chromosome in a. gambiae . sequence analysis showed contrasting patterns of evolution of these rmps between the sex chromosome and autosomes indicating differential selection of sex-chromosome duplications compared to the autosomal duplications . a. gambiae n= number of sequences, n= total number of mutations, s= no. of polymorphic sites and k= average number of nucleotide differences. rmp dependent aggregation of segmental duplications the rmps with intervening distances greater than 1 kb are low copy repeats in contrast to rmps of lengths less than 1 kb . we identified rmps with intervening distance greater than 1 kb wherein sequence identity of the intervening dna is greater than 90% <cit> to identify msds in each species . the neighbor-joining trees also confirmed the sequence relatedness of these duplicated loci . the sequences of duplicated copies of specific msds in select species are shown in additional file <dig> the % of rmps classified as msds is shown for each species. we performed a sliding-window analysis of the a. gambiae genome to determine the frequency of rmps and msds in each chromosome. the individual chromosomes were searched in different intervals to calculate the total number of msds as well as the number of repetitive paired microsatellites. it was found that the frequency of msds increases linearly with the frequency of paired microsatellites in each chromosome . similar results were also observed for chromosomes of other insects . these results clearly suggest that regions that are already rich in rmps tend to get richer in segmental duplications. this ‘rich-gets-richer’ based co-aggregation of msds along with rmps suggest an rmp dependent mechanism of aggregation of duplicated sequences in the genome, as part of the two-step process of genesis of segmental duplications <cit> . we then wanted to know whether higher segmental duplications with higher frequency of paired microsatellites is a within-genome feature or are they also correlated across genomes. by comparing the number of msds and the number of rmps across the <dig> species, it was found that the total number of segmental duplications increases significantly with increases in the total number of rmps among the species suggesting that the ‘rich-gets-richer’ mechanism may be a universal mode of rmp dependent aggregation of msds across genomes. however, it seems unlikely that the correlation between paired microsatellites and segmental duplications evolve in a phylogeny dependent manner among species. it is evident from figure <dig> that there is no correspondence between species phylogeny and the correlated variation between msds and rmps. genic versus non-genic association of msds by mapping the msd sequences to the annotated gene locations, we identified duplicated copies which are localized within or overlapping the coding and non-coding genes . these genes represented different gene ontologies in different insects , among which the ‘protein binding’ or ‘nucleus’ gene ontologies represented the top ranking predicted functions across species. the genic duplications accounted for only ~5-15% of the msds identified in different species indicating that the majority of duplications occur in the intergenic regions. the lower abundance of msds in genic regions compared to the non-genic regions may be related to differential selection pressure between genic and non-genic regions. for example, the duplications of n-1022 bp-n in the a. gambiae genome have genic copies . we determined the evolutionary divergence of the genic versus non-genic duplications . it was found that the genic copies have lower average evolutionary divergence than that of the non-genic copies indicating a possibility of selection constraint on genic duplications. in addition, we also investigated whether genes of a. aegypti that overlap with msds are also associated with the same msd copies in the one-to-one orthologous copies in c. quinquefasciatus and a. gambiae. our results show that these msds are never retained in orthologous genes , indicating the possibility of biased selection of msd sequences of orthologous genes. such bias is most likely associated with purifying selection as such microsatellites in gene rich segmental duplications are known to be associated with such selection bias <cit> . furthermore, our analysis indicated that the msds within protein coding genes are mostly localized in the intron regions . hence, the lack of retention of msds in orthologous genes may also be due to higher rate of intron evolution than the coding sequences among the genes <cit> . we also found evidence that msds are associated with gene duplications in specific species. the duplication of histone genes are clustered within a ~113 kb region of chromosome 2l of d. melanogaster . in this region, twenty duplicated copies of a msd was found wherein each copy has n and n as termini sequences and harbors four histone genes . this pattern of duplication is often called ‘duplication shadowing’ <cit> as the duplicated sequences tend to cluster in the region along with an ancestral copy. in this region of the d. melanogaster genome, the locus corresponding to 2l: 21426344– <dig> is the ancestral duplication as evident from phylogenetic analysis . as the duplications are anchored by same pair of microsatellites, it is likely that the ancestral copy might have expanded in that region by microsatellite mediated segmental duplications. to further confirm if msds are associated with gene duplications, we identified the ‘nearly identical paralogous’ genes . we were able to find several nips in the c. quinquefasciatus and d. melanogaster genomes that were associated with msds. however, we didn’t find any nip associated with an msd in a. aegypti, a. mellifera, a. gambiae and t. castaneum. thus, if microsatellite mediated sds have a role in gene duplication in insects; it is likely that such association is species-specific. to determine if msds may have association with transposable elements <cit> , we analyzed the annotated tes to identify sequence duplications that are anchored by microsatellite pairs . a list of the paired microsatellites associated with different tes in d. melanogaster is provided in additional file <dig> it shows that the total repertoire of msds associated with tes is only a minor fraction of the total number of msds observed in drosophila. this suggests that the msds are found primarily in te-free and gene-free regions of the genome. discussion in this study, we identified microsatellites that are repeated as pairs and investigated their association with segmentally duplicated sequences in insect genomes. we adopted a conservative approach to identify the repetitive microsatellite pairs in the genome by imposing the criterion that each pair has exactly the same intervening distance. however, we observed that, in some cases, the intervening distances are not exactly same but are similar among the microsatellite pairs. for example, the microsatellite pairs n and n are repeated <dig> times wherein the intervening distance is exactly <dig> bp compared to the other <dig> duplications of the same ssr pairs but with intervening distance ~ <dig> bp . the variation in intervening distances between the microsatellites may have resulted due to increase or decrease of repeat length of one or both of the microsatellites, possibly by slippage events during replications <cit> . slippage creates a loop in one of strands that gives rise to an insertion or a deletion in the subsequent replications depending upon if the loop is formed in the replicating strand or in the template strand respectively. this leads to an increase or decrease in repeat length of microsatellites. in most of the microsatellite pairs we identified, one of the microsatellites was variable in length while the length of the other microsatellite remained unchanged. it is known that sequence composition <cit> , imperfection in microsatellite motifs <cit> and the local mutation rate of microsatellite loci <cit> have roles in modulating the repeat length of the microsatellites that may account for variable intervening distances of paired microsatellites. furthermore, differential selection of simple sequence coding repeats <cit> may also account for the variation in distance between microsatellite pairs. more than two microsatellites repeated together in the genome were also identified from our analysis. for example, a cluster of microsatellites is repeated three times in a tandem manner within the region 2l: 9475131– <dig> of d. melanogaster genome. however, such repeats containing more than two microsatellites were exceptionally low in frequency in the insect genomes . on the other hand, repeats consisting of only two microsatellites are abundant in each species which was also observed by kofler et al. <cit> . segmental duplications have been characterized in few organisms, mostly in the human and d. melanogaster genomes <cit> . they are poorly studied in other species in spite of availability of draft genome sequences for many eukaryotes. our study is a first effort in this direction to identify segmentally duplicated sequences from genome assemblies of different insects. in this study, the segmental duplications represent only a proportion of duplications where we find microsatellites at the sequence ends of the duplications. although a comprehensive discovery of all the segmental duplications of these insects was not the aim of the present study, our results show that the repetitions of microsatellite pairs are associated with segmental duplications in insects but with extremely variable frequency. the a. aegypti and n. vitripennis genomes have more than one thousand msds whereas the t. castenium genome has only seven msds indicating that microsatellite anchored segmental duplications may be determined by species specific evolutionary processes. our results further showed that genomic regions with higher numbers of repetitive microsatellite pairs accumulate a greater number of segmental duplications than regions poor in paired microsatellites . this is a classic ‘rich-gets-richer’ mechanism where more segmental duplications tend to occur in regions that already have more duplicated sequences <cit> . such a mode of enrichment of sds in specific chromosomal regions has relevance to ‘duplication shadowing’ effects in genome <cit> . for example, duplication shadowing in the human genome contributes to ~ <dig> fold increased probability of sequence duplication in specific regions compared to their distribution in other regions <cit> . we observed such a pattern of segmental duplications in chromosome 2l of d. melanogaster where two n and n are repeated as sequence ends of each duplication . in this case, each sd contains four histone genes his <dig> his2a, his2b and his <dig> it was found that the entire ~3810 bp sequence representing the segmental duplication maps to a single cdna suggesting that the duplicated sequence containing the four genes is expressed as a common primary transcript. it is possible that duplication shadowing of gene regions may be an evolutionary strategy to modulate expression of specific genes as evident in primates <cit> . moreover, korbel et al. <cit> also found that segmental duplications of larger sequences enclosing specific protein coding genes often contribute to the expansion of protein-coding gene families. although the role of microsatellites in this process is not known, it has been found that microsatellites in the flanking sequences of genes may have a regulatory role in gene expression <cit> . moreover, simple sequence repeats in the coding region can influence translational selection of genes that can modulate expression level of those genes <cit> . these reports indicate that microsatellite mediated segmental duplications may have an effect on expression of the genes when they are associated with segmental duplications in the genome. the paired microsatellites identified from our investigation may be targets of non-homologous end joining , which is one of the mechanisms of segmental duplication <cit> . such processes are generally mediated by microhomologies at the ends of target sequences similar to the termini microsatellites of msds found in this study. consistently, association of microsatellites has been indicated in genomic rearrangements <cit> as well as segmental duplications <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that microsatellites are enriched at breakpoints of sds suggesting the possible role of microsatellite repeats in the genesis of sds <cit> . hence, our results further corroborate that microsatellites, by repetition as pairs, are likely to have a role in the genesis of sds in insect genomes. it is also likely that mechanisms other than involving microsatellites have roles in segmental duplications. non-allelic homologous recombination during meiosis using pre-existing repeat elements can also lead to segmental duplications <cit> . moreover, several factors such as length, orientation, degree of sequence similarity and the distance between the duplicated copies may lead to differential degrees of genomic rearrangements of sequences in genome <cit> . it is possible that the genesis of segmental duplications may also be controlled by the same mechanisms that generate copy number variations in genomes. cnvs are caused by different rearrangement events of sequences including deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations <cit> . however, kim et al. found that only a minor portion of cnvs is associated with segmental duplications in the human genome suggesting independent mechanisms of genesis of sds than that of cnvs. our data further suggests that duplications of paired microsatellites are localized mostly in the non-genic regions. in addition to that, the paired microsatellites in the genic regions are predominantly in the intron regions . we also found several msds that are associated with different transposable elements in the d. melanogaster genome . therefore, the role of microsatellites in intron evolution and retrotransposition events cannot be ruled out <cit> . given the role of transposition events in genome structure and function <cit> , it is likely that microsatellites are instrumental in extensive sequence transposition and duplication in the genome. CONCLUSIONS in this study, we have shown that microsatellites have significant association with segmental duplications in insect genomes. the repetitive paired microsatellites tend to accumulate in regions rich in segmental duplications suggesting a “rich-gets-richer” mode of aggregation of the duplicated sequences in the genome. results further suggest that these repetitive sequences are also associated with gene duplications in specific insect genomes. the study clearly suggests that repetition of paired microsatellites contribute to extensive sequence duplications in insect genomes. competing interests both authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors’ contributions conceived and designed the experiments: skb. analyzed the data: skb. contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: skb, dws. wrote the paper: skb, dws. both the authors read and approved the final manuscript. authors’ information skb is a research assistant professor in the department of biological sciences and the eck institute for global health at the university of notre dame, indiana. he has a broad interest in insect genomics and evolution with emphasis on disease transmitting vector species. dws is a professor of biological sciences and the director of eck institute for global health at the university of notre dame, indiana. his work focuses on genetic and genomic analysis of mosquito vector competence to various pathogens as well as on development and application of molecular tools to investigate population biology of mosquitoes. supplementary material additional file 1 number of microsatellites identified from genome assemblies of different insect species. click here for file additional file 2 list of rmps in d. melanogaster . click here for file additional file 3 significant enrichment of microsatellite sequences with repetitive paired microsatellites. this is a representative list of such ssr sequences of a. aegypti. click here for file additional file 4 list of microsatellite pairs which are duplicated within x chromosome or an autosome. they are not duplicated between x chromosome and an autosome. click here for file additional file 5 number of repetitive microsatellite pairs varies with the distance between the two microsatellites. click here for file additional file 6 sequence information of duplicated copies of representative msds in specific species. click here for file additional file 7 variation between the numbers of rmps and the corresponding numbers of msds in different chromosomal regions. click here for file additional file 8 list of genes associated with repetitive microsatellite pairs in different species. click here for file additional file 9 the top five ranking gene ontology terms of genes associated with rmps in selected species. click here for file additional file 10 list of nearly identical paralogs associated with repetitive microsatellite pairs in culex mosquito and fruit fly genome. click here for file additional file 11 microsatellite-anchored sds localized within the transposable elements of d. melanogaster . click here for file additional file 12 association of repetitive paired microsatellites and msds with transposable elements of d. melanogaster . click here for file acknowledgments the authors are thankful to daine lovin and joanne cunningham for critically reading the manuscript.",

RESULTS genomic feature correlates of protein er in this study, potential correlation between er and <dig> features for <dig> bacterial species was investigated. we observed strong correlations among cai, el, ppa, slc, and er; and less strong but significant correlations among ess, slm, tmh, as and er. however, weak relationships were found among mfs, slp, slo, sle, slw, hs, len, rsb and er. transcriptional abundance a single variable linked to transcriptional abundance was found to explain the dominance of observed variation in yeast ers <cit> . cai and el are related to transcriptional abundance, while protein abundance is a result of the combined consequences of transcription and translation. recent studies observed that mfs was strong for more abundant proteins, resulting in stronger evolutionary constraints of more highly expressed proteins <cit> . we used three variables to highlight the impact of transcriptional abundance on er. we used rnafold to predict the secondary structure of rna and to compute the strength of mrna folding. a recent study reported that rnafold predicted mfs is moderately correlated with experimentally determined mfs <cit> . furthermore, it was also shown that the correlation of the computationally predicted mfs and er was much weaker than that of the experimentally determined mfs and er. similarly, we also observed a low correlation between mfs predicted by rnafold and er in bacteria. however, in our study we found that cai and el were significantly linked to ers for most bacteria, depending on rank correlation coefficients . the top absolute coefficients were dominated by cai-er or el-er correlations. the cai-er coefficient in escherichia coli was - <dig> , which is greater than other coefficients. of these bacteria, helicobacter pylori showed no cai-er correlation ; this species was not subject to periods of competitive exponential growth <cit> . as a result, there was a lack of translational selection related to codon usage. in an early study, codon selection for translation was observed to strongly correlate with growth rates <cit> . we investigated the effects of growth on cai-er correlations, and found that weak correlations could be partially attributed to long-term bacterial generation times . to further investigate the impact of translational selection on cai-er correlation, codon usage separation was used to measure the strength of codon bias. a greater cus value indicated a stronger codon bias mediated by translational selection. we confirmed a correlation between cus and the cai-er coefficient . significantly different codon usage was found between ribosomal proteins and other proteins in the e. coli genome ; however, this was not observed in the h. pylori genome . the degree to which transcriptional abundance influences ers correlated with the strength of translational selection. it has been previously demonstrated that translational selection across species is also strongly affected by genomic gc content <cit> . we found that cai-er coefficients significantly correlated with gc content . cai-er coefficients of gc-rich bacteria are significantly greater than those for at-rich bacteria, as translational selection is often absent in at-rich organisms <cit> . it is also known that mrnas have a stronger secondary structure if there are more gc-rich codons <cit> . moreover, there is stronger selection to improve translation efficiency for weak folding at translation-initiation sites of a gene in gc-rich hosts <cit> . these gc-rich organisms preferentially use gc-rich optimal codons <cit> . gc-rich genomes therefore show stronger translational selection compared with at-rich genomes. accordingly, we found that transcriptional abundance does not always influence ers as gc content varies across species. a recent study found that cai, microarray-based el or sequencing-based el approaches for measuring transcriptional abundance affected the assessment of the importance of transcriptional abundance to er <cit> . we found that bacteria, whose el-er correlation was weaker than the cai-er correlation, demonstrated greater cus . for those species strongly mediated by translational selection, cai as opposed to el likely better explains the variation of er. although rna sequencing data could be more accurate than microarray data, there is currently little rna-seq data available for most bacterial species. in this study, we derived el from rna-seq data for e. coli, and used microarray data for other bacterial species. although the sequencing-based el-er correlation is weaker than the cai-er correlation in e. coli, it is stronger than other correlations. with the development of rna-seq experiments, we believe that the assessment of el-er correlations could be more accurate, and the impact of el on er could be stronger in certain bacterial species. to compensate for the inadequacy of each single variable to represent expression levels, we used cai, el and mfs to describe the impact of transcriptional abundance on ers. functional importance in an earlier study, it was proposed that ess and protein interactions were negatively correlated with coding sequence ers because of the constraints of important physical functions <cit> . we used many types of protein associations , not only physical protein interactions , which were directly extracted from the string database. as expected, significant correlations between ppa/ess and ers were found for almost all the bacteria we investigated in our study. the strength of ppa-er correlations was even greater than that of cai-er/el-er correlations in six organisms: acinetobacter adp1; francisella novicida; h. pylori; mycoplasma genitalium; mycoplasma pulmonis; and streptococcus sanguinis. in f. novicida, the ess-er correlation was also larger than that for cai/el-er. the function of a gene is indeed an important driving force in bacterial protein evolution. variation in subcellular localization most cellular activities, including many metabolic pathways and processes, occur within the slc. in this study, we observed significant negative correlations between slc and er. for example, the correlation coefficient for caulobacter crescentus was - <dig> . the slm surrounds the cytoplasm of living cells, and positive correlations between slm and er were also observed in our study. the cell membrane functions as a selective filter, allowing molecules either to be pumped across the membrane by transmembrane transporters, or to be diffused through protein channels. these transmembrane proteins are usually specific; as a consequence, slm proteins are fast-evolving and well adapted. we also found, as expected, that tmh positively correlated with bacterial protein ers. the positive correlations are relatively weak between other subcellular localizations and the ers of proteins. secreted proteins located in slo/sle for proteobacteria and slw/sle for firmicutes were found to rapidly evolve <cit> . this could be a potential explanation of why slw, slo and sle rapidly evolve. limitations of aromatic amino acids to manufacture proteins, microorganisms must synthesize their aromatic amino acids via the shikimate pathway. these amino acids have a limited source that impacts upon the rate at which translation errors can be corrected, and the maintenance of translation efficiency and accuracy. therefore, the adoption of aromatic amino acids in functional or abundant proteins is not encouraged. in this study, we found that slowly evolving proteins tend to avoid adopting aromatic amino acids. in most of the investigated bacteria, as positively and significantly correlated with er . head-on conflict in many bacteria, genes tend to be encoded on the leading strand. the likelihood of a gene being found on the leading strand was weakly, but significantly, associated with er in most of the studied bacteria. as an example, rsb of bacillus subtilis, whose genome contains over 70% leading proteins, was significantly and positively correlated with er . transcription and replication occur simultaneously in bacterial cells <cit> . replication progresses much faster than transcription, and inevitable conflicts occur between dna and rna polymerases when they bind to the same template. co-directional collisions occur when the leading strand is the template for transcription, resulting in head-on collisions taking place when the lagging strand is the template. head-on collisions have particularly deleterious effects, as replication forks may be arrested and transcription slowed. over the course of evolution, transcripts are more likely to be retained if they are on the leading strand, which explains why bacterial genes on the leading strand evolve more slowly than those on the lagging strand. multiple factors cooperatively dominate er in both e. coli and b. subtilis, cai has been identified as the most important driving force constraining ers, through the use of partial correlation and multivariate regression analyses <cit> . drummond et al. first used principal component regression analysis, and explained the dominant proportion of variation in yeast protein ers by transcriptional abundance <cit> . this analysis circumvents the problems of partial correlation and multivariate regression, as all principal components are orthogonal and independent. therefore, it was useful to determine the independent contributions of biological features to yeast ers <cit> . in contrast to the situation reported for yeast, e. coli and b. subtilis <cit> , our pcr results suggest that the contributions of multiple factors are comparable for the determination of bacterial protein evolution . we found that staphylococcus aureus was strongly influenced by codon bias , with ess, cai, el, ppa, slm, tmh and hs representing <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> and <dig> % of the total rate variation, respectively. these variables are comparable and account for <dig> % of the total variation. in other words, cai and el lose their dominance in explaining bacterial protein evolution, even in bacterial genomes with strong codon bias. of these investigated factors, ess, cai, el, ppa, slm, thm and hs each represent over 8% of the total variation in <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> and <dig> , respectively, of bacterial genomes. based on correspondence analysis results, we observed the universal rule that functional factors and transcriptional abundance were roughly grouped together, opposing the ers in the second principal component . evolutionary constraints on highly transcribed proteins might prevent misfolding <cit> or misinteraction <cit> . this can hamper functionality and even potentially produce a large quantity of toxic proteins. in contrast, constraints on essential or high connectivity genes possibly operate to avoid the abrogation of important physiological functions. the need for translational accuracy and robustness can help explain the selection exerted on ess, ppa, cai, and el. in a principal component plot obtained for yeast, ess and ppi were distant from cai and el <cit> . this suggests a close link between functional factors and transcriptional abundance in some bacteria that is probably dependent on er in some way. in all the bacterial species we investigated, slm, tmh and hs were found to cooperatively affect er . these three factors have been grouped in principal component plots . membrane protein transport takes place via helix-dependent protein channels embedded in cell membranes, because of their hydrophobic structure. the need to maintain transmembrane protein function may help explain the relationship among slm, tmh, and hs. different forces drive er in different species according to pcr analysis, factors associated with transcriptional abundance , important functionality and transmembrane protein function were the main contributors to protein er variation in over 50% of bacterial species we studied. transcriptional abundance is the most dominant factor in yeast <cit> , but not in mice <cit> or bacteria . the extent to which transcriptional abundance affects ers correlates with the strength of codon bias. our pcr analysis indicated multiple factors contribute to the rate of protein evolution in bacteria. we also found that ppa was a common important contributor to bacterial evolution, with greater effects than cai/el. our results were basically identical to those presented by plotkin and fraser <cit> -ppi appears to be responsible for most of the er variation in yeast. the deleterious effects of protein misinteractions can affect the optimal protein concentrations and shape functional interaction networks <cit> . therefore there is a need to maintain proper interactions among high connectivity proteins as it constrains their evolution. although ess does not contribute strongly to yeast ers, it is still an important factor in determining bacterial protein evolution. our findings suggest that various forces drive protein sequence evolution in different species. CONCLUSIONS we have uncovered new relationships among ers in bacterial genomes related to protein subcellular localization, transmembrane helices, hydropathicity, aromaticity, and replication strand localization. er had a significant negative correlation with slc, but a significant positive correlation with slm. because of the effects of tmh and hs on slm, these two variables were also found to positively, although relatively weakly, correlate with bacterial protein ers. the impact of bacterial slm/tmh/hs and slc on er is independent of functional importance and transcriptional abundance. this is consistent with results from a recent study in mammalian proteins <cit> . we also found that proteins that evolved slowly in bacterial genomes tended to avoid adopting aromatic amino acids. additionally, bacterial genes on the leading strand evolved more slowly than those with genes on the lagging strand. we investigated the independent contributions of biological features to er, and found that the dominant effect of transcriptional abundance on er is absent in bacteria. factors that retain important functionality , maintain cell membrane function and avoid a build-up of toxic molecules caused by misfolding or misinteraction influence the ers of bacterial proteins. if more rna-seq data are available in the future, the correlation of el-er could be found to be stronger in certain bacterial species than reported here. however, the influences of ppa, ess, slm, tmh, and hs on er are comparable with the impact of transcriptional abundance on er in most bacteria.",

    "prompt": "Distill this medical abstract into few key sentences. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND micrornas , short conserved endogenous non-coding rnas, inhibit messenger rna targets by repressing translation or reducing mrna stability <cit> . mirnas critically modulate many cellular events, including the balance between proliferation and differentiation during organ development <cit> . in pluripotent stem cells , mirnas play important roles in regulating stem cell bioprocesses . mirnas modulate stem cell pluripotency and differentiation . knocking out the key mirna processing enzymes dicer <cit> or dgcr <dig> <cit> causes stem cells to lose their pluripotency. mirna- <dig> cluster has been proposed to regulate the core pluripotency factors like pou5f <dig> . mirna-302- <dig> cluster has also been used to induce pluripotency <cit> . on the other hand, mirnas like let- <dig> induce stem cell differentiation <cit> . however, these recent studies have mostly focused on individual gene functions in stem cells although genome-wide data might be employed, and the conclusions drawn from these current studies are unavoidably biased on genes selected by these studies. therefore, these studies only provide partial mechanisms of mirna functions in stem cells, and the overall systems mechanisms of how mirnas regulate stem cell processes remain largely elusive. mirnas generally do not work alone to perform their functions <cit> . one mirna might target more than <dig> genes <cit> , and one gene can be repressed by multiple mirnas in a sequence-specific fashion <cit> . in turn, proteins can physically bind to the promoters and enhancers of mirnas to regulate mirna activations <cit> . these binary interactions between mirnas and proteins would form a complex systematic network. this complexity of mirna interaction network presents a challenge for conventional approaches like gene-knockout to unbiasedly capture the real mechanisms of mirna functions in stem cells. this present study employed systems physical network approaches <cit> and constructed a comprehensive and unbiased map of genome-wide interactions between mirnas and their targets to investigate the global basis of mirna roles in pluripotent stem cells, from the pluripotent self-renewal state to the differentiation state. results of the present study lay a conceptual framework for future studies and applications of mirnas in stem cells. RESULTS physical network of mirna and protein interactions in stem cells to systematically reveal the roles of mirnas in stem cells, this study first constructed a systems network <cit> of interactions between mirnas and proteins by combining multiple published datasets. these interactions contain binary interactions from two directions, from mirnas to mrnas coding for proteins, and from proteins to mirna promoters and enhancers. the mirna-targets were inferred from clip-seq data, which simultaneously identify mirnas-mrna interactions by measuring mirna-argonaute complexes <cit> . protein-targets were inferred from chip-seq, which measures protein interactions with dna <cit> . the clip-seq and chip-seq provide data of physical binding interactions. the systems interaction network constructed here includes physical interactions of both mirna-targets and protein-targets.fig. <dig> overall view. a, the concept of mirna and protein interactions. b, workflow of this study. c, overall view of the entire network constructed by this study. d, a sample of entire network contents shows direct interactions between mirnas and pluripotent core factors . nodes denote mirnas or proteins as labeled; red node represents the gene up-regulation in pluripotent stem cells, green node as down-regulation, and white node as insignificant expression. edges represent interactions; red edge denotes mirnas targeting proteins and green edge represents the binding of proteins with the regulatory elements of mirnas . this labeling strategy applies to all fig.s in this study the entire network contains ~ <dig> nodes and ~ <dig> interactions . both chip-seq and clip-seq measures genome-wide targets and thus this network provides a global map of mirna targets in stem cells. for example, the genome-wide interactions between mirnas and the pluripotent core factors could be extracted from this network . due to its natural interactions generated from experimental data, this network would provide accurate interactions between mirna and their targets, and results generated from this network would be reliable. the primary role of mirnas in stem cells to understand the primary role of all mirnas activated at the pluripotent state in stem cells, we searched for the biological functions of the network activated by mirnas in stem cells. to avoid the dataset biases and to ensure our results general, we included different datasets of mirnas and genes coding for proteins and selected mirnas and genes that are only activated with high frequency in all datasets . these activated mirnas and genes were used to enrich the entire network to get the activated network using methods as previously described <cit> . the network activated by overexpressed mirnas and down-regulated proteins formed a subnetwork activated by up-regulated mirnas in the pluripotent state. to avoid bias, we run the go functional analysis of this subnetwork <cit> by separately using references of both entire go annotation database and a set of all up-regulated genes in stem cells. different references generated different enrichment p-value but produced the similar result that the entire subnetwork primarily functions for development, with corrected p-value < <dig> e- <dig> . this activated subnetwork was further enriched by the developmental go term to obtain the developmental module . this developmental module was decomposed into functional modules based on network topology <cit> and it contained <dig> sub-functional modules . all of these <dig> modules primarily function for development , indicating that the primary function of over-expressed mirnas at pluripotent state is to repress developmental modules.fig. <dig> mirnas primarily repress developmental processes in pluripotent stem cells. a, up-regulated mirnas primarily target a developmental module, which includes <dig> primary sub-modules functioning for development as highlighted in cycles. b, the key modules targeted by the top <dig> important mirnas . c, the key modules were significantly and abundantly enriched in the developmental category the repressing role of up-regulated mirnas was further evidenced by examining the targets of three primarily represented mirna groups, the top overexpressed mirna group, a mir-302- <dig> cluster, and a single mir- <dig> first, a total of <dig> out of the <dig> most important mirnas, which were selected on the basis of the variance contribution to the system , directly target a developmental sub-network . among the <dig> mirnas, the top <dig> mirnas also target a module that primarily functions for development . furthermore, the well-known mir- <dig> cluster and even a single mirna, mir- <dig> also target modules functionally enriched in the developmental category with respectively corr p-value < <dig> e- <dig> , and corr p-value < <dig> e- <dig> . therefore, overexpressed mirnas at pluripotent state primarily repress development. biologically, to maintain the self-renewal and pluripotency, stem cells have some ways to prevent development and differentiation. this repressing function of mirnas can help mirnas claim their contributions to the stem cell properties at the pluripotent state.fig. <dig> modules targeted by mir-302- <dig> cluster and mirna- <dig> a, modules targeted by the mir-302- <dig> cluster and their functional enrichment was shown in b. c, a module targeted by mirna- <dig> and d, its functional enrichment on the other hand, the down-regulated mirnas in stem cells directly target genes that primarily function for metabolism and pluripotency, such as sox <dig> and pou5f <dig> . these down-regulated mirnas become up-regulated during differentiation and directly slower the entire metabolic processes and inhibit pluripotency during this state. together, mirnas primarily and directly repress development during the pluripotent state while they repress metabolism and pluripotency during cell differentiation. paths from activated mirnas to pluripotent core factors mirnas like mir- <dig> cluster mediate pluripotency <cit> , and it thus was assumed that top over-expressed mirnas such as mir- <dig> and mirna-290- <dig> cluster in stem cells might directly or indirectly target pluripotent core factors <cit> . to investigate if these top mirnas directly target the core factors, we systematically searched the shortest paths respectively from the top important mirnas as described above to the three core factors . surprisingly, all these top mirnas, including mir-302b, mir- <dig> mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> do not directly target any core factors . actually, the direct basis of these mirnas regulating the pluripotent core factors seemed blurred because all these mirnas must go through at least <dig> steps to reach any pluripotency core factor. these two steps include a mirna and a protein, which are not consistently expressed with these mirnas. this suggested that these top over-expressed mirnas in stem cells do not directly mediate the pluripotency.fig. <dig> pathways from activated mirnas to pluripotent core factors. a, b, c, d, the shortest paths from mir-302b, mir- <dig> mir- <dig> and mir-292-5p respectively to the pluripotent core factors. none of these top overexpressed mirnas directly binds to any of these core factors. e, core factors directly targeted by activated mirnas in stem cells to circumvent the bias of selected mirna groups, we further globally and unbiasedly searched for all up-regulated mirnas that target the pluripotent core factors . surprisingly, we only found one mirna that barely up-regulated <cit> in the pluripotent state and directly binds to sox <dig> , which was also targeted by down-regulated mirna- <dig> this indicated that activated mirnas do not primarily and directly target the pluripotent core factors during the pluripotent state. on the other hand, regardless of expression, only limited mirnas directly bind to pou5f <dig> while many mirnas directly target sox <dig> although they might not over-express in stem cells , indicating that mirnas target sox <dig> more than pou5f <dig> this suggested that the connection from mirnas to the pluripotent core factors primarily go through sox <dig> in contrast with the current thought that mirnas should primarily target pou5f <dig> <cit> , a key factor for reprogramming induced pluripotent stem cells. pluripotent network targeted by activated mirnas we next expanded the pluripotent gene list to all pluripotent genes uncovered by hu et al. <cit> . we still focused on the direct mirna target and searched the first neighbor of all overexpressed mirnas and all down-regulated mirnas . most of these targets are shared by up- and down-regulated mirnas , indicating that the primary pluripotent genes in stem cells are carefully modulated by multiple up- and down-regulated mirnas. the function of the entire shared network is primarily for extrinsic signal pathways associated with pluripotency . for example, the highly connected nodes apc, rad <dig> and eif4g <dig> are involved in wnt signaling and mitotic cell cycle pathways <cit> . signaling pathways with similar functions were also found in the network targeted by over-expressed mirnas only and in modules directly targeted by the represented mirnas cluster in stem cells, such as mir-302- <dig> cluster and mir- <dig> . this indicated that mirnas in the pluripotent state primarily function for modulating the balance of pluripotent signal pathways instead of directly targeting pluripotent core factors. this suggests that these regulations driven by mirnas might go through multiple steps to the pluripotent core factors.fig. <dig> pluripotent genes targeted by over-expressed mirnas in stem cells. a. venn diagram of pluripotent genes targeted by both up-and down-regulated mirnas. b, activated modules commonly targeted by both up- and down-regulated mirnas. the enlarged nodes represent the highly connected targets that are targeted by both up- and down-regulated mirnas in stem cells, and they work for pluripotent signal pathways. c, down-regulated modules targeted by over-expressed mirnas in stem cells. d, activated modules targeted by the mir-302- <dig> cluster in stem cells. e, an activated network targeted by mir-294 interestingly, il6st were regulated by multiple mirnas in pluripotent state . a protein complex constructed by il6st and lifr and stabilized by lif is a regulatory complex to maintain self-renewal in stem cells <cit> . targeting il6st here further suggested the important role of mirnas in modulating pluripotency. in contrast to the up-regulated mirnas in pluripotent state, down-regulated mirnas directly target the core pluripotency factors like mirna <dig> targeting sox <dig> . these down-regulated mirnas in the pluripotent state are actually up-regulated during the differentiation state and these pluripotency core factors become down-regulated in differentiation. this direct linkage between up-regulated mirnas and down-regulated core factors suggested that these mirnas directly inhibit the pluripotent core factors and repress pluripotency to facilitate differentiation during stem cell differentiation. this result parallels with recent experimental observations showing that mirnas repress the pluripotent core factors and pluripotency during differentiation <cit> . to summarize, mirnas do not directly target pluripotent core factors during pluripotent state but mirnas directly target and repress these core factors during differentiation. mirnas abundantly target epigenetic system the above result indicated that the number of mirna binding to pluripotent genes was very limited. the target with the highest degree, eif4g <dig> was only attacked by ~ <dig> up-regulated mirnas . it was expected that a certain group of nodes should be targeted by more than that. this drove us to further search the network hubs in the entire network. we systematically ranked the mirna targets by degree and obtained the top hubs. the top hubs mostly function for rna processing, but surprisingly, dnmt3a, a dna-methyltransferase for de novo dna methylation, was among the top hubs. dnmt3a actually holds more than <dig> mirna binding sites in 3'-utr region based only on 8 bp seed mapping and it was ranked within the top 1 % of the up-regulated mirna targets . dnmt3a was even ranked higher than eif4g <dig> the highest ranked node in the pluripotent genes , indicating that dnmt3a should be a top important node in the network directly regulated by mirnas in the pluripotent state. this also indicated that mirnas predominately target dna methylation system, rather than the pluripotent genes. we extracted the network of dnmt3a directly targeted by mirnas and found that the top mirna clusters , such as mir-302- <dig> and mir-290- <dig> cluster, were among the mirnas that target dnmt3a . similarly, many well-known mirna clusters in stem cells also target dnmt <dig> , an enzyme predominately responsible for methylation in hemimethylated cpg islands. many down-regulated mirnas also target dnmt3a and dnmt <dig> , but their attacks would lead to differentiation instead of maintaining pluripotency in stem cells as discussed above <cit> . these abundantly overexpressed mirnas that target the methylation system suggest that mirnas predominately repress dnmts in the pluripotent state.fig. <dig> mirnas abundantly target dna methylation systems. a, dnmt3a was targeted by <dig> up-regulated mirnas and was ranked in the top 1 % of the up-regulated mirna targets. the network nodes were plotted against the node degree . b, the dnmt3a network targeted by mir nas. the most important mirnas, including the mir-302- <dig> and mir-290- <dig> cluster, are found in the dnmt3a network. c, mirnas target another methylation enzyme dnmt1 in addition, mirnas directly and abundantly target a core histone modification complex , including mef2c , which was targeted by the top over-expressed mirna clusters including mir-290- <dig> and mir- <dig> cluster . up-regulating mef2c enhances stem cells differentiation <cit> , and down-regulated mef2c inhibits differentiation <cit> . the down-regulation of mef2c targeted by the top over-expressed mirna clusters suggests that mirnas repress differentiation in stem cells. this is consistent with our discussion above on the mirna repressing development and differentiation at the pluripotent state in stem cells . together, mirnas directly and abundantly target the epigenetic systems at the pluripotent state.fig. <dig> mirnas directly target a histone complex. the mir-290- <dig> cluster heavily attacks the mef2c dna methylation mediates the mirna activation in stem cells to search the mechanism controlling the mirna activations, this study turned to the genome-wide sequencing of dna methylation in stem cells and methylation-loss-stem cells <cit> . a total of 2000 bp in each upstream and downstream of start sites of all activated mirnas were examined. while the dna methylation in the downstream of up-regulated mirnas is not different from that of down-regulated mirnas , the down-regulated mirnas hold significantly higher methylation upstream than up-regulated mirnas . surprisingly, the biggest difference locates in ~1000 bp up-stream instead of immediate up-stream . furthermore, these differences are overall negatively correlated to mirna expressions with correlation coefficient of − <dig> and p-value < <dig> . this suggested that the difference in dna methylation accounts for the mirna activations. this parallels a recent observation showing that the loss of dna methylation significantly increases mirna expressions <cit> . therefore, mirna activations and their network are mediated by dna methylation in ~1000 bp upstream regions.fig. <dig> dna methylation mediates mirna activations in stem cells. a, the methylation levels upstream and downstream from the mirna start site. down-regulated mirnas have significantly higher methylation in upstream region when compared with up-regulated mirnas. b, detailed methylation profiling for regions that are 2000 bp upstream from the activated mirnas. the top <dig> down-regulated mirnas have higher methylation around -1000 bp than that of the

red line represents regression line discussion this study is the first investigation, to our knowledge, to search the primary mechanism of mirna functions in stem cells at systems level on the basis of a physical map constructed by direct interactions of mirnas and proteins. mirnas play critical roles in maintaining overall properties like pluripotency in stem cells , but the mechanisms still remain largely elusive. here, we systematically revealed that mirna primarily target developmental modules during the pluripotent state while another set of mirnas directly target pluripotent core factors during differentiation state. this suggests that one of mirna primary functions is to repress development at the pluripotent state to prevent stem cell differentiation and to keep stem cell pluripotency while mirnas also degrade pluripotent core factors to facilitate differentiation during differentiation state. this is consistent with the recent observation that overexpressions of mirnas induce pluripotency <cit> and mirnas also facilitate stem cells differentiation <cit> . the mechanism of mirnas in regulating pluripotency has been widely investigated , but the systems mechanism remains elusive. one of fundamental questions is whether mirnas directly or indirectly regulate the pluripotency at system level. it has been consistently observed that gene expressions of the top over-expressed mirnas are positive correlative to that of pluripotent core factors. recent evidences also show that mirna-302- <dig> cluster could induce pluripotency <cit> . the observations led to a speculation that mirnas might directly target the pluripotent core factors. although mirnas could have many functions in certain conditions, the primary functions of mirnas are for degrading and inhibiting their targets. if the overexpressed mirnas directly target the core factors, these mirnas would likely repress the core factors as previously evidenced <cit> , leading to down-regulations of these core factors. a negative correlation between them was expected, but in fact, a positive correlation has been consistently observed. this suggests that the top mirnas might not directly target and degrade pluripotent core factors. here, we utilized the power of our system network to exhaustively search the direct linkages between mirnas and the pluripotent core factors. our results revealed that the top mirnas such as mir- <dig> and mirna- <dig> cluster do not directly target any core pluripotent factors during the pluripotent state . most of top mirnas only directly target the extrinsic signal pathways associated with pluripotency . a signal from a signal pathway normally travels through multiple steps to reach its targets. therefore, the top mirnas indirectly target the core factors and indirectly regulate the pluripotency. in contrast to the indirect mechanism of mirnas in targeting the genetic system, the top mirnas, including mir-302- <dig> and mirna- <dig> cluster, directly and abundantly target the core enzymes of dna methylation system, dnmt3a and dnmt <dig> targeting these dnmts by the top expressed mirnas suggests inhibition of dnmts, which highly express in somatic cells but lowly express in stem cells. this parallels the most recent observations showing that gene expressions of up-regulated mirnas are negatively correlative with that of dna methyltransferases <cit> and that micrornas degrade dnmts in stem cells <cit> . during self-renewal and pluripotency, mouse stem cell genome are in hypomethylated status, and genome-wide three methylase are tightly depressed <cit> . our data showed that abundant mirna directly target dna methylase, suggesting that mirnas play a crucial role in repressing dna methylation machinery during pluripotency. our result of mirna directly repressing dnmts contributes to the understanding of the positive relationship existing between up-regulated mirnas and overexpressed core pluripotent factors in stem cells as discussed above. over-expressed mirnas directly target dnmts, leading to dna methylation reductions at genome-wide level, including the loci of the pluripotent core factors. this results in over-expression of these core factors responsible for pluripotency. this is consistent with the observation of less methylation in the loci of the core factors during induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming, and it is also consistent with our recent finding that the demethylation level can be used as a variable for discriminating different stem cells <cit> . therefore, mirnas primarily and directly target the epigenetic system that further activates pluripotent core factors in stem cells. this parallels the most current report that mirnas degrade dnmts in stem cells <cit> . dna methylation might regulate expressions of a certain group of genes in stem cells <cit> . our data further showed that dna methylation globally mediates the mirna activations in stem cells. these mirna activations by dna methylation in turn repress the dna methylation. less methylation activates the mirnas and pluripotent core factors again. together, we proposed a system-wide circuit to describe a part of mirna primary roles in modulating pluripotency in pluripotent stem cells . in this circuit, mirnas directly repress development and directly repress the dna methylation system, while mirnas indirectly regulate pluripotency genes. this repression of dna methylation activates both pluripotent factors and mirnas. the activations of pluripotent factors and repression of development contribute to pluripotency in stem cells, while the activations of mirnas further inhibit both dna methylation and development. this creates an active system-wide circuit in stem cells to maintain the pluripotent state .fig. <dig> a system view of mirnas primary mechanistic roles in maintaining pluripotency in pluripotent stem cells. mirnas directly repress both the dna methylation system and the development, while indirectly regulate pluripotency genes. reduced dna methylation activates the mirnas and pluripotent core factors for pluripotency. the activated circuit between mirnas and dna methylation, as well as the development inhibition, help stem cells to maintain the pluripotent state, see text for detail. the solid lines are directly derived from the present study and they represent direct interactions and the dash dark line represents indirect interactions, while dash green lines denote evidences from reference papers. the network interactions of proteins targeted by multiple mirnas also provide a systems vision of quantitative regulatory mechanism of mirnas in stem cells. for example, our study uncovered that many up- and down-regulated mirnas directly target dnmts and wnt pathway like apc, suggesting that dna methylation and wnt pathway are delicately regulated in stem cells dynamically. these regulations are controlled by not only simply turning on/off genes but also mediated by the quantitative concentrations of many gene expressions. the slightly quantitative alternation of each component concentration could result in change of stem cell state, self-renewal or differentiation. this quantitative regulatory mechanism can help to revise the controversial mechanisms derived from individual gene studies. for example, wnt signaling and pathway components interact with pluripotent core factors to regulate stem cell pluripotency and differentiation <cit> , but whether wnt signaling promotes pluripotency or differentiation has been intensively debated recently <cit> , partially due to lack of system-wide vision on it. these components targeted by mirnas revealed here with other system-network level data could provide novel clues to design biological experiments and select mathematical models to clarify the role of wnt pathway in stem cells and to finally solve this controversial issue. CONCLUSIONS this study mostly focused on the primary functions of mirnas in pluripotent state. we systematically revealed that mirnas directly repress dna methylation systems and primarily inhibiting development to help stem cells to maintain pluripotency in the pluripotent state. however, we do not exclude other functions of mirnas in stem cells. the results made here are based on the current limited data and these mirna functions drawn here only account for a part of mirna roles in stem cells. with data accumulating, more functions of mirnas will certainly be explored. recently, an exciting field of noncoding rna studies have revealed that long noncoding rnas , transcripts of more than <dig> nucleotides, participate in the regulation of the pluripotent state and differentiation. these incrnas even regulate the complex mirna network and interact with dna methylation machinery like methylase <cit> . a more exciting comprehensive map of mirna-lncrna-dna methylation-mrna can be expected. nevertheless, our key results and conclusion regarding the fundamental basis of primary mirna functions in regulating mouse stem cell pluripotency and differentiation have actually also been observed in human <cit> , suggesting that these mirna functions might be conserved in both mouse and human. understanding the fundamental systems roles of mirnas studied here would broadly direct the future functional studies of mirnas in both human and mouse stem cells. materials and methods data resources this study analyzed multiple datasets published in public database, geo database . these data were generated by high-throughput methods as detailed in additional file 1: table s <dig> including clip-seq, chip-seq, rna-seq, microarray, and bisulfite sequencing dna . data bioinformatics analysis to be consistent and comparable, all sequencing data were mapped to mouse genome . all fastq files from clip-seq, chip-seq and rna-seq were aligned using bwa <dig> . <dig> with default

generated by using genomicranges <dig> under r <dig> and were subjected to second noise quartile cutoff. the filtered clusters located in 3’utrs and cdss were used to search for mirna bindings. the mirna bindings were searched against the perfect match of mirna seed sequences using home-made python scripts. the seed sequences were extracted from mirna sequences downloaded from mirbase <dig> . peaks from chip-seq were called using sissrs <dig> and the peaks were annotated using chippeakanno <dig> under r- <dig> . the differential expressions from rna-seq were performed using negative binomial model using edger <dig> under r <dig> . bisulfite dna methylation was counted against the genome coordinates of mirnas . microarray data were analyzed using limma <dig> under r <dig> . activated genes and mirnas selection to minimize the biases from individual experiments and cell lines as well as the confounders caused by high-throughput methods, we selected genes and mirnas activated in different conditions by using different sets of data . expression data from various resources were employed. genes coding for proteins with activating frequency >50 % in all observations and mirnas with activating frequency of more than 25 % out of all observations were treated as activated genes and were selected . the up-regulation and down-regulation was based on comparison to somatic cells in each experiment . the top important mirnas were selected on the basis of their contributions to network structure and variance by using the algorithm as we previously published <cit> . briefly, the top mirnas were selected on the basis of their ranking scores calculated by the eigengene-based connectivity as defined below <cit> . score=didmax+2×cor|xi,e)| where di denotes the ith node degree, and dmax denotes the maximum degree of a node in the entire network. |cor| represents the absolute pearson correlation coefficient, where xi represents a vector of ith node value, and e eigengene of the network. network construction and analysis the network construction and analysis were performed by approaches as our previous reports <cit> . briefly, we built the map by collecting the interactions of both mirnas targets from the clip-seq and protein-binding promoters of mirnas from chip-seq data. the interactions from clip-seq and chip-seq were signed as mirna or proteins respectively . only the direct interactions were selected and included, and thus this map is a physical binding network. the network was enriched by the activated genes and mirnas selected above to get the activated network. functional modules were further enriched by the functional genes based on gene ontology enrichment . six sub-modules in functional developmental module were based on network topology to identify the densely connected modules. the target node ranking was based on the degree of each mirna node . additional file additional file 1: figure s <dig> functional enrichments of all

    "prompt": "Summarize the main pharmacological interventions described. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND many gram-positive bacteria produce anti-bacterial peptides and small proteins, called bacteriocins. there are three main classes produced by gram-positive lactic acid bacteria : class i bacteriocins are the lantibiotics, small , post-translationally modified peptides containing unusual amino acids such as lanthionine; class ii are small, unmodified, heat-stable bacteriocins ; class iii include larger heat-labile proteins, such as murein hydrolases <cit> . most bacteriocins are synthesized as precursors, which are matured and secreted, then target a specific bacterium and kill it by increasing its membrane permeability to various small molecules. class ii bacteriocins are subdivided into iia, pediocin-like unmodified bacteriocins, iib, two-peptide unmodified bacteriocins, iic, formerly class v, where the n- and c-termini are covalently linked resulting in a cyclic structure, and class iid, non-pediocin, single, linear peptides <cit> . the genetics and biosynthesis of class iia bacteriocins have been well studied <cit> , and these constitute one of the most important groups of antimicrobial peptides, due to their useful antibacterial properties. all known iia bacteriocins are described as being active against listeria and some have already been tested as food preservatives for controlling food-borne pathogens <cit> . structurally, class iia bacteriocins are related to each other being unstructured in aqueous solution, but with a central amphiphilic alpha-helical region when in lipid micelles or tfe <cit> ; they contain the characteristic conserved n-terminal ygngvxcxxxxc sequence, though usually not the gxxxg motif characteristic of iib and iic bacteriocins <cit> . the class iib two-peptide unmodified bacteriocins, for example plantaricin e/f <cit> , need the complementary action of both peptides to be active <cit> . these bacteriocins contain long amphiphilic alpha-helical stretches, and the two complementary peptides interact when exposed to membrane-like entities. the gxxxg motif is conserved in many two-peptide bacteriocins, and it is postulated that the two complementary peptides dimerize via a helix-helix interaction that involves this motif, to form the functionally active heterodimer <cit> . the dimer functions by creating a pore within the membrane through which small molecules leak out, and, typically, the genes encoding the two peptides are found adjacent to each other on the same operon <cit> . the cyclic class iic bacteriocins are characterized by being tryptophan-rich and lacking any gg, gxxxg or ygngvxcxxxxc motifs, <cit> ; the class iid bacteriocins have none of these features but some have recently been found also to be circular, rather than linear, with conserved axxhhn and ahhw/f motifs <cit> . in order to neutralize the toxic effect of the peptide on the \"producing\" cell the genes encoding bacteriocins are generally co-transcribed with a cognate immunity protein. these small proteins interact very tightly with a specific bacteriocin or pair of bacteriocins and protect the \"producing\" microbe from the toxic effect of its own bacteriocin <cit> . the immunity proteins usually show high specificity for their cognate bacteriocins <cit> . for each class iia bacteriocin encoded in a genome there is a one to one relationship between bacteriocin and cognate immunity protein; whereas, in contrast, for each pair of class iib two-peptide bacteriocins there is a single cognate immunity protein encoded in a genome <cit> . structures of five immunity proteins have already been solved: imb <dig> <cit> , enta-im <cit> , pedb <cit> , pisi <cit> , and mun-im <cit> , all protective against iia bacteriocins. as yet, no structures for immunity proteins protective against iib or iic bacteriocins have been solved. the sequencing of bacterial genomes, including those from human pathogens, has revealed a number of genes which might potentially code for new bacteriocins and immunity proteins, suggesting that the use of these antimicrobial peptides is more widespread than previously thought and that bacteria might be targeting several different bacterial species using these toxins. understanding which specific immunity protein neutralizes which bacteriocin toxin is important if these peptides are to be used as antimicrobials. the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes, closely related to lab, is one of the most common human pathogens. it causes a wide range of both minor diseases such as pharyngitis, erysipelas and pyodermas, that are readily controlled by antibiotics, as well as major, often lethal, conditions such as acute rheumatic fever, necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, in developing countries and in the western world <cit> . the search for new antibacterial agents effective against this species is thus urgent. other streptococcal species have been shown to secrete bacteriocin-like toxins, as there are reports of s. salivarius producing a variety of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances showing in vitro inhibitory activity against s. pyogenes, including salivaricin a <cit> . such observations suggest that antibacterial toxins are playing a very important role in controlling the level of the s. pyogenes population in human microbiomes. bacteriocin-like toxins and antitoxins may well have an impact on the development of new antibacterial strategies and treatments. a thorough understanding of the biology of the bacteriocins in combination with their immunity proteins is important for any possible therapeutic use of bacteriocins. the full sequences of lab genomes provide opportunities to scan for the presence of toxins and their corresponding immunity proteins. however, the sequence alone may not be sufficient to identify these proteins. here we present the first structure of the protein from locus spy_ <dig> , named pyogenecin immunity protein sp-pip, determined at <dig> Å resolution. we provide structural and sequence analyses, and identify the putative corresponding bacteriocin-like toxins in the s. pyogenes genome, which are found to belong to the class iib two-peptide bacteriocins. RESULTS structure determination we have expressed the pyogenecin immunity protein from s. pyogenes in escherichia coli and purified it to homogeneity. the crystal structure of sp-pip was solved by the single wavelength anomalous diffraction method using selenomethionine -substituted protein. the model was refined to <dig> Å with an r-factor of <dig> % and an r-free of <dig> %. the crystal asymmetric unit contains <dig> well ordered residues and <dig> water molecules. the first methionine and the <dig> c-terminal residues are disordered and cannot be identified in the electron density maps. the structure is high quality; all non-glycine and non-proline residues of the model lie either in the most favorable region or in the additionally allowed region of the ramachandran plot. detailed refinement statistics and crystallographic data are shown in table <dig> the crystal structure of sp-pip, shown in figure <dig> is a typical anti-parallel four-helix bundle. the four long helices pack tightly together around a well-defined hydrophobic core. one additional short helix connects helices h <dig> and h <dig> all long helices are between <dig> and <dig> residues in length. helix-pairs h1/h <dig> and h2/h <dig> are parallel to each other and helix-pairs h1/h <dig> and h3/h <dig> cross over each other at an angle of approximately 30°. in the structure, the n- and c-termini are very close together . overall, the protein is slightly acidic with two large acidic patches near each end of the bundle and one large positively charged patch near the n- and c-termini. structural analysis structural comparisons, using the dali server <cit> , reveal that the structure of sp-pip matches a range of proteins all having a four helix bundle topology, with a z-score of <dig> or less. in this range of z-scores, it is not clear whether the matches are due to homology or simply to structural similarity. however, structural homology combined with sequence analysis, enabled us to relate this protein to structures that ranked 2nd , 10th and 23rd in the list of dali matches, and the results are shown in table <dig> these homologous proteins are all pediocin-like immunity proteins. sp-pip shares a rmsd of <dig> Å with imb <dig> 1tdp, over <dig> residues, and, using the structure comparison service ssm at european bioinformatics institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm <cit> , the rmsd is found to be <dig> Å. dali scores for structures representative of groups a, b and c immunity proteins against sp-pip. sequence analysis guided by the structure of sp-pip, whose sequence had not been assigned to any known protein family, we sought to expand our knowledge of its sequence relatives using the pfam database <cit> . having identified that it was structurally similar to known members of the pfam enta_immun family we carried out an analysis with profile hidden markov models to determine whether sp-pip should also belong to this family or not. taking the enta_immun family from pfam release <dig> as a starting point we carried out iterative searches using the hmmer package . after multiple rounds of searching of the hmm against the sequence database using an e-value threshold of <dig> along with careful manual inspection of the resulting matches we were able to detect <dig> sequences compared to the <dig> sequences found in pfam release <dig> . the family has been updated in the current release of pfam - <dig> - and the alignment is now available on the pfam web-site at: http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk//family/pf <dig> domain analysis we investigated whether any other protein domains were to be found on any immunity proteins in the enta_immun family. some members of the family do also carry associated domains. one protein contains an n-terminal helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator , and a group of methionine sulfoxide reductases from enterococcus faecium and closely related species carry a c-terminal pmsr domain - peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase - as well as the n-terminal immunity protein domain. proteome analysis sp-pip belongs to a large family of putative bacteriocin immunity proteins. to investigate the possible targets of the presumed immunity protein we carried out an analysis of the proteomes of several strains of s. pyogenes, including m <dig> gas, mgas <dig> and mgas <dig> to try to identify any complementary bacteriocins and immunity proteins. we searched the proteomes with hmms of both the known class i, antibacterial <dig> , and class ii bacteriocins, bacteriocin_ii , bacteriocin_iic as well as with the enta_immun families, from the pfam database . we have identified a small genomic region containing four genes encoding putative bacteriocin proteins of class iib , and have called the proteins pyogenecin <dig> <dig> <dig> and <dig> respectively . the organization of this region is shown in figure 2a. we have also identified two separate gene loci encoding immunity proteins in the s. pyogenes genome: spy_ <dig> and spy_ <dig> both encoded proteins were found in all the s. pyogenes strains examined, and are identified as belonging to the enta_immun family , a family which contains nearly <dig> different members from lab and closely related species. discussion the four-helix bundle structure of sp-pip was found to be most closely related to those of a number of pediocin-like iia immunity proteins. three subgroups of pediocin-like iia immunity proteins have been defined on the basis of common sequence motifs and phylogenetic analysis <cit> , being denoted as groups a, b and c, as shown in figure 3: • group a: enta-im, the enterocin a immunity protein, <cit> ; pdb id:2bl8 • group b: pisi, the piscicolin <dig> immunity protein <cit> ; pdb id: 2k19 • group c: imb <dig> the carnobacteriocin b <dig> immunity protein <cit> ; pdb id:1tdp the structural comparison results suggest that sp-pip is most closely related to imb <dig> from subgroup c. these results suggest that sp-pip is highly likely to function as a bacteriocin immunity protein with similarities to proteins from group c. sequence analysis reveals that sp-pip belongs to the now expanded pfam family of immunity proteins enta_immun that also includes pediocin-like immunity proteins from groups a, b and c as detailed above, thus confirming its evolutionary link to known bacteriocin immunity proteins. a search for other immunity proteins of a similar nature in the s. pyogenes genome identified another gene locus encoding a protein matching the enta_immun family. both of these loci were seen in all strains examined. unlike the case in many other species, in s. pyogenes these bacteriocin immunity proteins were not found closely linked to their bacteriocins, a condition that might be explained by the remnants of a transposon identified between them. functions for proteins may often be inferred through consideration of the combinations of the functional domains found on them. a number of domain-pairings were identified on some of the immunity family members, such as an n-terminal helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator on one protein, which might be suggestive of immunity proteins acting as transcriptional regulators or of interacting with transcription regulators and modulating their function. a group of methionine sulfoxide reductases are found to carry both a c-terminal pmsr domain and the immunity domain. the pmsr domain is involved in reversing protein inactivation by oxidation of methionine residues. however, it is not clear what, if any, functional significance these domain-pairings might have. the search for potential bacteriocin targets for this putative immunity protein took in classes i, ii and iii. our analyses identified that s. pyogenes contains a class i lantibiotic system composed of one unique lantibiotic type a sequence called srta and just one unique immunity protein srti. these two genes are closely associated on the genome, but are separated from the proteins of the class ii system described below as well as from the presumed immunity proteins. this suggests that the sp-pip is unlikely to act as an immunity protein for class i bacteriocins. class ii bacteriocins are subdivided into classes iia, iib, iic and iid. we did not find any bacteriocins of class iia encoded by the s. pyogenes genome, which would have the well-conserved n-terminal ygngvxcxxxc motif <cit> . searches were not made for bacteriocins of types iic or iid since the immunity proteins complementary for these two groups identified so far, gassericin a <cit> and circularin a, <cit> do not share sequence or size similarity with those of the pediocin-like immunity proteins. the four putative class iib proteins we identified from a short genomic region, and named pyogenecins 1- <dig> are found as two tandem pairs of genes separated by a gene in the antisense orientation that encodes a transposase pseudogene. the presence of this pseudogene suggests that this region might once have been part of a mobile genetic element. finding bacteriocins in pairs is characteristic of the class iib bacteriocins <cit> . as with other class iib bacteriocins, these pyogenecins have a conserved gg leader peptide, as well as the conserved gxxxg motif necessary for helix-helix interaction between the two proteins, as illustrated in figure 2b. all four putative pyogenecins are found to fall into the pfam bacteriocin_iic family , a family of bacteriocins secreted by streptococcal and other lab species. based on the sequence similarity to other two-peptide bacteriocins, the genomic arrangement of the genes found, and the identification of two immunity proteins, we hypothesize that the putative pyogenecins <dig> and <dig> associate to form one active bacteriocin and pyogenecins <dig> and <dig> associate to form a second active bacteriocin possibly targeting a different bacterial species. these peptides need now to be synthesized to allow testing of their biological activity in a suitable bacteriocin-assay. given that we find two immunity proteins we suggest that each one is specific for one of the putative bacteriocin pairs, pyogenecin1/pyogenecin <dig> and pyogenecin3/pyogenecin <dig> there is also the possibility that one or both of these immunity proteins might be an orphan immunity protein <cit> , so-called because no cognate bacteriocin in the genome has been identified; and it has been pointed out that most other immunity proteins so far determined for iia two-peptide bacteriocins are small trans-membrane proteins closely coupled transcriptionally with their bacteriocins <cit> . however, it would appear that the sequences of only a handful of two-peptide immunity proteins have been deduced and neither are there defined structures for any of these nor are most of them more than putative immunity proteins, the designation being based only on the presence of predicted transmembrane helices <cit> , so comparison with the system we propose here is difficult. the exact method by which immunity proteins protect their host cell or interact with the bacteriocins is also unclear, but it may be that the orphan immunity proteins do confer resistance to other bacteriocins in addition to their cognate bacteriocin <cit> . it is possible of course that many more two-peptide-like systems remain still to be characterized, as there are a large number of additional lab peptides in the pfam family bacteriocin_iic pf <dig> which are \"pairs\" in the sense that they are expressed from closely adjacent genes and for which a cognate immunity protein has not yet been identified. CONCLUSIONS the structure of the putative immunity protein sp-pip protective against potential class iib two-peptide bacteriocins could be the first structural representative of this class. a combined structural, genomic and proteomic analyses has allowed the identification and in silico characterization of a new putative immunity protein from s. pyogenes. structurally similar proteins seem to provide immunity protection for single peptide iia class bacteriocins. further biological and biochemical studies are needed to verify the antibacterial activity of the putative pyogenecins and to determine the degree of resistance and cross-resistance provided by the proposed immunity protein.",

    "prompt": "Create a plain-language summary of this clinical abstract. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND embryonic stem cells were first derived from the blastocysts of mice in <dig> <cit> and humans in <dig> <cit> . es cells have two important properties: theability to maintain pluripotency, which is the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of cells, and rapid proliferation. these characteristics make mouse es cells an essential component of gene targeting technology. these qualitiesalso make human es cells attractive sources for cell transplantation therapy to treat various diseases, including spinal cord injuries and juvenile diabetes. the molecular mechanisms underlying the pluripotency and rapid proliferation of es cells are currently a major focus of the field of stem cell biology <cit> . to identify molecules essential in es cells for these properties, several groups have utilized transcriptome analyses to identify genes specifically expressed in es cells and early embryos. these analyses, including dna microarray analyses <cit> and expressed sequence tag analyses <cit> , identified several common transcripts, including esg <dig> that was also designated dppa <dig> or ecat <dig> esg <dig> was originally identified as a transcript ph <dig> that was down-regulated by retinoic acid in embryonic carcinoma cells <cit> . the expression of this gene was confined in mice to early embryos and germ cells <cit> . it is also expressed in pluripotent cells, including es cells, embryonic germ cells, and multipotent germline stem cells <cit> . esg <dig> encodes a polypeptide of <dig> amino acids that contains a single kh domain, which is an rna-binding domain <cit> . it remains unclear, however, if esg <dig> functions as an rna-binding protein or the roles it plays in es cells and mice. previous genomic library screening by identified genomic clones containing the mouse esg <dig> gene and seven pseudogenes <cit> . two of these pseudogenes exhibit a similar exon-intron structure as the esg <dig> gene, indicating their generation by gene duplication. the five remaining pseudogenes did not contain any introns, indicating that these were generated by retrotransposition of esg <dig> transcripts. the chromosomal localizations of the mouse esg <dig> gene and pseudogenes, however, have not been reported. in this study, we determined the structure of the mouse gene encoding this protein and related pseudogenes. we also performed gene targeting to determine the physiological function of esg <dig> RESULTS chromosomal localization and structures of mouse esg <dig> gene and psedogenes to determine the chromosomal localizations of the mouse esg <dig> gene and pseudogenes, we performed a blast analysis of the mouse genomic database with the esg <dig> cdna sequence as a query. we identified several putative pseudogenes without introns on chromosomes <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> <dig> and x . in addition, two intron-less pseudogenes were identified in dna fragments for which the chromosomal localization remained unmapped. while these pseudodgenes have significant homology to esg <dig> cdna, they could not produce functional proteins, because of critical mutations. this result suggests that there are a larger number of intron-less pseudogenes than previously anticipated. existence of multiple retropseudogenes is a hallmark of pluripotent cell-specific genes <cit> . on chromosome <dig> we identified a dna fragment similar to the esg <dig> gene that included two putative introns. these putative first and second exons, however, contained multiple mutations of the esg <dig> cdna sequence. the putative third exon was identical to that of the previously reported esg <dig> gene. also on chromosome <dig> we identified another dna fragment that was similar, but not identical, to the third exon of the esg <dig> gene. these findings suggest that these esg1-like sequences on chromosome <dig> have not been correctly assembled. to obtain dna fragments containing the esg <dig> gene, we screened the bacterial artificial chromosome dna pool by pcr using primer pairs that would only amplify the real gene, not the pseudogenes. we obtained two independent, but overlapping bac clones. southern blot analyses and sequencing demonstrated that these clones contained a sequence exhibiting complete identity with esg <dig> cdna that was interrupted by two putative introns . the two intron sequences begin with gt and terminate with ag, fulfilling the gt-ag rule of exon-intron junctions <cit> . the 5' flanking region of this dna fragment exhibited strong promoter/enhancer activity by luciferase reporter assays in undifferentiated es cells, but not in somatic cells . the same fragment showed much weaker activity after induction of differentiation by retinoic acid. we concluded that this sequence is the esg <dig> gene. we also found that the two bac clones contained another esg1-like sequence . the two sequences, separated by a <dig> kbp intergenic sequence, were oriented in opposite directions. the esg1-like sequence exhibited greater than 95% identity to the exons and introns of the esg <dig> gene. this sequence, however, contained critical nucleotide substitutions in all of the exons and one nucleotide insertion in exon <dig> . although <dig> base pairs of the 3' flanking regions were conserved between the esg <dig> gene and the pseudogene, only five base pairs of the 5' flanking region were identical. this 5' flanking region did not possess any promoter/enhancer activity in luciferase reporter assays . it is thus unlikely that this sequence is transcribed or translated into a functional protein. this sequence likely represents a duplication pseudogene. bierbaum previously reported the existence of two pseudogenes with similar exon-intron organization as the esg <dig> gene <cit> . we could not determine which of these two pseudogenes corresponds to the one we identified or the location of the remaining pseudogene. targeted disruption of the mouse esg <dig> gene to study the function of esg <dig> we deleted the gene by homologous recombination in mouse es cells. we replaced the three exons with either a fusion of the neomycin-resistance and β-galactosidase genes or the hygromycin resistant gene using two targeting vectors introduced into rf <dig> es cells by electroporation. we obtained eight es cell clones with correct homologous recombination of the β-geo targeting vector, which was confirmed by southern blot analysis . we obtained only one clone with correct homologous recombination of the hygr targeting vector. to obtain homozygous mutant es cells, we introduced the β-geo vector into hygr heterozygous es cells. of <dig> g418-resistant colonies tested, <dig> were homozygous for esg <dig> deletion. northern blot and western blot analyses confirmed the absence of esg <dig> in these cells . in <dig> clones, the β-geo vector had replaced the hygr vector, such that the cells remained heterozygous. in the remaining <dig> clones, the β-geo vector was integrated at non-homologous sites. esg1-/- es cells exhibited normal morphology . these cells also proliferated at a speed comparable to that of the control cells . esg1-/- cells differentiated normally after the removal of leukemia inhibitory factor or retinoic acid treatment . when transplanted into hind flanks of nude mice, these cells produced teratomas, tumors containing components of all three germ layers . these results indicate that esg <dig> is dispensable for the self-renewal properties and pluripotency of es cells. we examined the gene expression profiles of esg1-/- es cells using oligonucleotide-based dna microarrays representing ~ <dig> genes. in comparison to control es cells, esg <dig> was identified as the gene reduced to the greatest extent in esg1-/- es cells . the expression of es cell marker genes, such as nanog and oct3/ <dig> was normal in esg1-/- es cells. we confirmed normal oct3/ <dig> expression at protein levels by western blot . the overall gene expression profiles were similar between control es cells and esg1-/- es cells. several genes exhibited a greater than two-fold reduction in esg1-/- cells, including krt1- <dig> pem, ctgf, ptgs <dig> igf <dig> and inhba. these genes might be regulated directly or indirectly by esg <dig> since esg <dig> contains a kh-type rna-binding domain, it may stabilize mrna of these genes. further studied are required to clarify this possibility. to generate esg1-knockout mice, we injected β-geo-esg1+/- es cell clones into the blastocysts of c57bl <dig> mice. we obtained germline transmission from three clones. we obtained esg1-/- mice at the mendelian ratios from intercrosses of esg1+/- mice. these animals exhibited normal development, gross appearance, and fertility . histological examination of testis and ovary could not identify any abnormalities . these data demonstrated that esg <dig> is dispensable for both mouse development and germ cell formation. we also generated es cells from blastocysts obtained by intercrosses of esg1+/- males and esg1-/- females. of the eight es cell lines established, two clones were esg1-/-. these esg1-null es cells demonstrated normal morphology, proliferation, and differentiation , confirming that esg <dig> is dispensable in es cells. CONCLUSIONS to analyze the physiological roles of esg <dig> we identified the mouse gene on chromosome <dig> and deleted it by homologous recombination in es cells. despite specific expression in early embryos, germ cells, and pluripotent cells, our data demonstrated that esg <dig> is dispensable for mouse development, germ cell formation, and es cell self-renewal.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the patient's history, exam, and plan in a concise paragraph. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND several heavy metals play important roles as trace elements in the metabolism of all kingdoms of life. whether a trace element is useful or harmful depends on its concentration. particularly, chromium and cadmium are known to be much more toxic than useful for most microorganisms <cit> . chromium is commonly present in solutions as chromate and dichromate oxyanions ), the most redox-reactive and soluble forms of the metal <cit> . due to its similar chemical structure to sulfate anions, chromate crosses membranes via sulfate uptake systems <cit> . on the other hand, cadmium is a non-redox-reactive metal with high affinity for thiol groups <cit> . once inside cells, chromate, dichromate and cadmium exert their toxic effects by directly damaging cellular components and by inducing oxidative stress <cit> . in order to reduce the toxicity of chromate, dichromate and cadmium, some microorganisms eliminate these metals from the cytoplasm by using active transport efflux pumps <cit> . cadmium can also be sequestered within the cells by metal-chelating proteins, while chromate and dichromate are reduced to the less toxic and insoluble trivalent cation cr by specific nadh-dependent enzymes under aerobic conditions or in the electron transport chain of bacteria such as pseudomonas fluorescens lb <dig> in anaerobic environments <cit> . in addition, several enzymes work to counteract the deleterious effects of the oxidative stress induced following cell exposure to chromate, dichromate and cadmium. caulobacter crescentus, an oligotrophic free-living α-proteobacterium, is able to grow in polluted habitats <cit> . not surprisingly, its genome encodes some homologues of genes involved in heavy metal resistance. in a previous report, the set of genes responding to caulobacter exposure to chromate, dichromate and cadmium was identified <cit> . the main actions triggered in response to these metals are protection against oxidative stress and reduction of intracellular metal concentration . however, the signal transduction and control processes involved in the bacterial response to these heavy metals are still poorly characterized. the c. crescentus genome encodes <dig> extracytoplasmic function sigma factors <cit> . two of them, the paralogous σt and σu, are involved in the response to various environmental stress conditions, including chromium and cadmium stresses <cit> . additionally, σe mediates a rapid transcriptional response to cadmium, organic hydroperoxide, singlet oxygen and uv-a <cit> . in a previous report, σf was found to be required for bacterial survival under hydrogen peroxide stress in the stationary growth phase, but no σf-mediated transcriptional response to hydrogen peroxide could be observed <cit> . thus, the involvement of σf in a transcriptional response to environmental stresses still needs to be characterized. the observation that genes cc <dig> cc <dig> and cc <dig> previously found to be dependent on σf <cit> , are induced following c. crescentus exposure to chromate, dichromate and cadmium <cit> suggested to us that σf could be involved in the transcriptional response to these heavy metals. in the present work, we demonstrate the involvement of σf in chromium and cadmium stress responses. we also identified the set of genes regulated by σf by using global transcriptome analysis and characterized the promoter region of these genes by 5´race experiments and β-galactosidase assays. furthermore, we investigated the role of the protein encoded by the second gene in the sigf operon , here named nrsf, and two conserved cysteine residues in this protein on the σf-mediated response to heavy metals. RESULTS σf is involved in chromium and cadmium responses in c. crescentus in order to verify a possible involvement of σf in the c. crescentus response to chromium and cadmium stresses, we monitored expression of cc <dig> previously identified as a σf-dependent gene, as well as cc <dig> which is co-transcribed with sigf , by quantitative rt-pcr. this analysis showed that cc <dig> is significantly induced in parental cells following exposure to either dichromate or cadmium . in contrast, expression of cc <dig> in a sigf deletion mutant strain exposed to dichromate or cadmium was found to be quite similar to that observed in the same strain under no stress condition . we could also observe significant induction of cc <dig> in the presence of dichromate, though the induction was modest when compared to the increase in expression of cc <dig> . on the other hand, no significant increase in cc <dig> expression was found in sigf mutant cells following dichromate exposure . taken together, these results confirm the involvement of σf in c. crescentus response to chromium and cadmium stresses and suggest that the operon sigf-cc <dig> is not strongly auto-regulated under these conditions. to simplify our analyses and data presentation, we only show the expression of sigf and its target genes under dichromate stress in all subsequent experiments. it is assumed that heavy metal ions cause oxidative stress inside cells <cit> . this raises the possibility that induction of σf-dependent genes by chromium and cadmium is a direct consequence of oxidative stress. to test this hypothesis, we stressed the parental and the sigf mutant strains with hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, paraquat or diamide . according to qrt-pcr experiments, expression levels of cc <dig> and cc <dig> were not increased more than twofold in the parental strain during these stress conditions . in agreement, transcript levels of cc <dig> and cc <dig> were also not influenced by any of these stressors in cells lacking sigf. concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and t-butyl hydroperoxide used in our analyses were previously found to be sufficient to increase expression of other genes in c. crescentus <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that chromium and cadmium are able to induce the σf regulon in an oxidative stress independent manner. σf controls a small set of genes under chromium stress with the aim of identifying additional genes induced during stress conditions under the control of σf, we compared the gene expression pattern of parental cells with that of a sigf mutant under dichromate stress, using microarray chips containing up to three different probes corresponding to the beginning of the coding region of each gene from c. crescentus. by considering these probes, we found only six genes down-regulated in sigf mutant cells relative to the parental strain . interestingly, close inspection of probes corresponding to the upstream region from cc <dig> and cc <dig> suggested that these regions are also down-regulated in sigf mutant cells when compared to the parental strain. the transcriptional start sites of the operons cc2906-cc <dig> and cc3255-cc3256-cc <dig> seem to be located quite distant from the translational start sites of cc <dig> and cc <dig> predicted by the tigr annotation. genome organization suggests that cc <dig> is the first gene of the transcriptional unit cc3254-cc3255-cc3256-cc <dig> . according to the tigr annotation, the deduced amino acid sequence of cc <dig> displays an n-terminal extension of <dig> amino acid residues not found in orthologous sequences. by excluding this extension, the most probable translational start site of cc <dig> is at position + <dig> relative to the translational start site of cc <dig> suggested by the tigr annotation . thus, all probes designed to measure cc <dig> expression in microarray chips correspond to a region upstream from the translational start site of cc <dig> proposed here. however, probes corresponding to the upstream region of cc <dig> cover the entire coding region of cc <dig> therefore, by considering these probes, we could include cc <dig> as a σf-dependent gene . this is in accordance with the previous observation that the complete transcriptional unit cc3254-cc3255-cc3256-cc <dig> is induced under chromium and cadmium stresses <cit> . a according to cmr annotation of genome of cb <dig> strain. b referring to the number of amino acid of the deduced protein sequence. protein length is according to cmr annotation or prediction from our analysis. c corresponding to the number of possible transmembrane helices in the mature protein. the number was determined by tmhmm tool. d according to a re-analysis of the deduced protein sequences by using pfam and smart tools to search for conserved domains. e sequences were compared with protein databases using blastp. f microarray hybridization of rna samples isolated from exponential phase cells exposed to <dig> μm potassium dichromate for <dig> min. genes with m value of < − <dig> or > <dig> were assumed as differentially expressed between strains analyzed. values are the log <dig> ratio as mentioned. results shown are the average of three independent biological experiments. wt and Δsigf refer to the parental strain na <dig> and sigf deletion mutant, respectively. nc refers to no significant change in gene expression. g quantitative rt-pcr experiments performed with total rna extracted from exponentially growing cells immediately before and following exposure during <dig> min to <dig> μm potassium dichromate . results were normalized using gene cc <dig> as the endogenous control, which was constitutively expressed under the conditions analyzed. values are the log <dig> ratio as mentioned. data are mean values of two independent experiments. wt and Δsigf refer to the parental strain na <dig> and sigf deletion mutant, respectively. na corresponds to genes not analyzed in qrt-pcr experiments. the cc <dig> gene is predicted to be transcribed divergently from cc2906-cc <dig> in the chromosome of cb <dig> strain. however, the corresponding gene was not included during annotation of the more recent genome sequencing of c. crescentus . in the chromosome of na <dig> an open reading frame was proposed to be located between genes ccna_ <dig> and ccna_ <dig> . nevertheless, ccna_ <dig> appears to be co-transcribed with ccna_ <dig> and ccna_ <dig> in addition, we could observe co-occurrence of ccna_ <dig> with other σf-dependent genes. as the nucleotide sequence between cc <dig> and cc <dig> in cb <dig> strain is identical to the region between ccna_ <dig> and ccna_ <dig> of na <dig> strain, we conclude that cc <dig> was incorrectly annotated in the genome of cb <dig> strain and this gene is the first one of the operon cc2907-cc2906-cc <dig> . as evaluated with probes corresponding to the upstream region of cc <dig> the entire coding region of cc <dig> is down-regulated in sigf mutant cells relative to the parental strain . therefore, the complete transcriptional unit cc2907-cc2906-cc <dig> is controlled by σf. a thorough re-annotation of genes regulated by σf suggested that cc <dig> codes for a putative membrane protein belonging to the doxx family, whose members are involved in sulfur metabolism. the cc <dig> gene, which encodes the putative sulfite oxidase subunit yedy, is another protein with a potential role in sulfur metabolism. all of the remaining σf-dependent genes code for proteins with conserved domains of unknown functions. interestingly, the pairs of genes cc <dig> and cc <dig> cc <dig> and cc <dig> as well as cc <dig> and cc <dig> are probable paralogous genes, with amino acid sequence identities of 36%, 43% and 23%, respectively. therefore, it is possible that the gene products of both operons exert similar functions. no other gene in the genome of c. crescentus displays significant nucleotide sequence similarity to the above mentioned pairs of paralogous genes or to the functionally annotated genes cc <dig> and cc <dig> proteins encoded by cc <dig> and cc <dig> present a duf <dig> domain at their n-terminus. this domain was described to be a dna-binding domain in ngo <dig> from neisseria gonorrhoeae <cit> . ngo <dig> is involved in the transcriptional regulation of msrab, which codes for a methionine sulfoxide reductase <cit> . however, in our microarray experiments, we could not observe differences in the expression of msra homologs in c. crescentus . thus, we conclude that the role of ngo <dig> in n. gonorrhoeae and cc <dig> or cc <dig> in c. crescentus is most likely different under these circumstances. to confirm results obtained in transcriptome analysis, we investigated the expression levels of five genes supposedly dependent on σf by qrt-pcr experiments. these analyses showed that expression of these selected genes under dichromate stress is more than twofold higher in the parental strain relative to the sigf deletion mutant . interestingly, induction of cc <dig> expression in the presence of dichromate was only partially dependent on σf , suggesting the involvement of an additional regulatory protein in the control of cc <dig> expression under this stress condition. taken together, these results confirm the data obtained in global transcriptional analysis. promoter sequence motifs of cc <dig> and cc <dig> genes are highly similar to those of sigf to identify putative σf-dependent promoters upstream of cc <dig> and cc <dig> genes, we performed 5’race experiments using primers that hybridize in the beginning of the coding region of the corresponding genes. for these experiments, rna samples from cells exposed to dichromate were used, as this stress condition leads to increased expression levels of cc <dig> and cc <dig> this approach led to the identification of a transcriptional start site for cc <dig> at position − <dig> relative to the translational start site + <dig> proposed here . a tss was also determined at position − <dig> with respect to the translational start site of cc <dig> predicted here . as expected, no tss could be observed when an additional 5´race experiment was performed using primers that hybridize to the beginning of the coding region of cc <dig> proposed by the tigr annotation. together, these data confirmed our microarray data with respect to expression of the operons cc2907-cc2906-cc <dig> and cc3254-cc3255-cc3256-cc <dig> the putative promoter sequences found for cc <dig> and cc <dig> were very similar to each other and also quite similar to the promoter sequence previously determined for sigf <cit> . additionally, analyses of the region upstream of the translational start site + <dig> of cc <dig> also revealed a putative σf-dependent sequence , suggesting a direct control of this gene by σf. accordingly, the putative σf-dependent promoters reported here are highly similar to sequences found upstream from sigf homologs in other bacteria <cit> . conserved sequences upstream of cc <dig> and sigf are necessary for expression of these genes to confirm the putative promoter sequence of the gene cluster cc3254-cc3255-cc3256-cc <dig> transcriptional fusions containing a fragment encompassing the region upstream of the translational start site of cc <dig> predicted in this work and the lacz reporter gene were created . caulobacter cells harboring these different constructs were used in β-galactosidase assays. when monitored in unstressed parental cells, a plasmid construction with the complete promoter sequence of the transcriptional unit cc3254-cc3255-cc3256-cc <dig> resulted in higher β-galactosidase activity with respect to the empty vector placz <dig> or to the construct lacking the − <dig> promoter element . only basal β-galactosidase activity was observed with any of the constructions in cells of the sigf null mutant strain . these results confirmed the data from qrt-pcr and 5’race experiments. analyses with dichromate stressed cells showed no significant increase in β-galactosidase activity in the parental strain , probably due to the damage caused during dichromate stress to β-galactosidase in particular or to proteins in general. as mentioned above, the promoter sequence of the operon cc3254-cc3255-cc3256-cc <dig> is highly similar to that located upstream from sigf. to verify if sigf expression was also dependent on these putative promoter elements, we analyzed the upstream region of the sigf gene in β-galactosidase assays using two different plasmid constructs: pcklac53- <dig> containing the promoter elements upstream from sigf and construct pcklac53- <dig> that lacks the sigf promoter . β-galactosidase activity measured in parental cells harboring the construct pck53- <dig> was found to be quite similar to that observed in cells with the empty vector. on the other hand, higher β-galactosidase activity was observed in the parental strain carrying construct pck53- <dig> which contains the complete sigf promoter sequence . cells from sigf mutant harboring the construct pcklac53- <dig> presented β-galactosidase activity slightly lower than that observed in parental cells with the same construct, but still higher than that observed in cells harboring the construct pck53- <dig> . altogether, these data indicate that the promoter sequence upstream from sigf is necessary for expression of the sigf operon, but in a manner that is not exclusively dependent on σf. this observation suggests that another sigma factor could also be capable of recognizing the region upstream from sigf. thus, we have investigated the effect of two other ecf sigma factors involved in oxidative and heavy metal stresses, σt and σe, upon sigf promoter activity, but no significant decrease in β-galactosidase activity was observed in mutant strains Δsigt and Δrpoe when compared with parental cells, all harboring construct pcklac53- <dig> . additionally, qrt-pcr experiments confirmed these results, as no change in transcription levels of the sigf gene was observed in a sigt or rpoe mutant . these observations allowed us to rule out the participation of σt and σe in the control of sigf expression. to further verify if the promoter region upstream of sigf is controlled by σf, we overexpressed sigf in the parental strain from an additional plasmid-encoded copy of the gene under the control of a constitutive promoter and measured β-galactosidase activity in these cells harboring either pcklac53- <dig> or pcklac53- <dig> overexpression of sigf in cells with the construct containing the complete sigf promoter led to an increase in β-galactosidase activity, whereas no difference was observed in cells harboring the promoterless construct pcklac53- <dig> . similarly, higher β-galactosidase activity was observed in sigf overexpressing cells bearing the construct containing the promoter sequence motifs upstream from cc <dig> when compared to the parental strain carrying the same construct or sigf overexpressing cells harboring the construct containing only the − <dig> motif of the promoter sequence of cc3254-cc3255-cc3256-cc <dig> . therefore, these results confirm that specific and highly similar promoter sequence motifs found upstream from sigf-cc <dig> and cc3254-cc3255-cc3256-cc <dig> are required for the control of these transcriptional units by σf. cc <dig> negatively regulates σf regulon expression the chromosomal organization of cc <dig> and sigf in a putative operon suggests that cc <dig> could be involved in the same regulatory pathway of σf. to test the assumption that cc <dig> could control σf activity, we monitored the expression of σf-dependent genes in parental cells overexpressing cc <dig> from a plasmid-encoded copy of the gene under the control of the constitutive lacz promoter present in vector pjs <dig> for that, cells overexpressing cc <dig> were stressed or not with dichromate and compared in qrt-pcr experiments with cells harboring the empty vector pjs <dig> or cells without this vector under the same conditions. according to qrt-pcr experiments, expression of genes cc <dig> and cc <dig> was slightly reduced in cells overexpressing cc <dig> under no stress conditions, when compared to cells with the empty vector pjs <dig> or cells without the vector . however, induction of cc <dig> and cc <dig> expression under dichromate stress was clearly absent in cc <dig> overproducing cells, when compared to cells not overexpressing cc <dig> . no difference could be found in the expression levels of two control genes when we compared cells overexpressing cc <dig> or not . this observation rules out a possible nonspecific effect due to overproduction of the protein. taken together, these data indicate that cc <dig> here denominated nrsf, acts as a negative regulator of σf function in c. crescentus. upon dichromate stress, sigf expression was also slightly down-regulated in cc <dig> overexpressing cells, whereas under control conditions sigf expression was practically unchanged. this once again favors the hypothesis that sigf is not strongly auto-regulated. a further attempt to investigate the role of nrsf as a possible negative regulator of σf function was carried out by trying to construct a null mutant strain in gene nrsf. however, it was not possible to construct a mutant strain by deleting nrsf in the parental strain . on the other hand, nrsf could be deleted in the absence of a functional copy of sigf , suggesting that high σf activity is apparently responsible for the failure of disrupting nrsf in cells with functional sigf. the putative protein encoded by nrsf is composed of six putative transmembrane segments separated by five short linkers and an n-terminal segment of <dig> residues . alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of cc <dig> with its orthologs from other bacteria revealed two highly conserved cysteine residues . the cysteine residues of the caulobacter protein are probably directed into the periplasmic space , which favors their putative role in the signal transduction process leading to the liberation of σf from nrsf inhibition. substitution of the conserved cysteines by serine led to two single mutants and a double mutant . even under unstressed conditions, all σf-regulated genes analyzed in qrt-pcr experiments, including sigf and cc <dig> were up-regulated in the single mutant strains when compared to the parental strain . the substitution of both cysteines by serine in nrsf resulted in the highest expression levels of the genes analyzed . under stress conditions, both single substitution mutant strains showed an additional induction of σf-dependent genes, whereas no differences were observed for the double substitution mutant strain, compared to unstressed conditions . therefore, these results show that substitution of one or both of the conserved cysteines in the protein encoded by nrsf affects the ability of this protein in maintaining expression of σf-dependent genes at basal levels, further indicating the negative role of nrsf in the control of σf activity. σf is released into the cytoplasm during chromium stress and in cells carrying point mutations in conserved cysteines of nrsf the presence of six putative transmembrane segments in the protein coded by nrsf would imply that σf is sequestered to the inner membrane of caulobacter cells. however, at least a portion of this sigma factor would be expected to be released into the cytoplasm following chromium and cadmium exposure. to investigate this assumption, we monitored σf levels in the membrane and soluble fractions of caulobacter cell extracts by western blot analysis . when extracts from parental cells under no stress condition were analyzed, σf was only detected in the membrane fraction. although the majority of σf was still observed in the membrane fraction of extracts from parental cells exposed to dichromate, a significant portion of the sigma factor could also be detected in the soluble fraction. additionally, we found that substitution of both conserved cysteine residues of nrsf also led to a significant accumulation of σf in the soluble fraction, even when cells were not exposed to dichromate. in contrast, the membrane-bound ftsh protease was only detected in the membrane fraction of both strains analyzed . taken together, these results showed that cells displaying increased expression of σf-dependent genes accumulate this sigma factor in the cytoplasm. neither σf nor σf-dependent genes cc <dig> and cc <dig> are essential for caulobacter resistance to metal stress to investigate the requirement of sigf for resistance of c. crescentus cells to dichromate or cadmium, the sensitivity of the parental strain and the sigf deletion mutant to exposure to these metals was monitored. both strains displayed similar sensitivity profile to dichromate or cadmium , suggesting that sigf is not essential for bacterial survival under this stress condition. as the deduced protein sequences of cc <dig> and cc <dig> are highly similar, we constructed a single deletion mutant strain in each gene as well as a double mutant and tested the resistance of these strains to the metal stresses. similar to what was found for the sigf deletion mutant, no increased sensitivity was observed for these mutant strains following exposure to either dichromate or cadmium, when compared to parental cells . together, these data suggest that σf-mediated transcriptional response to chromium or cadmium is not essential for survival of c. crescentus to exposure to these metal ions. discussion in this report, we clearly show that c. crescentus σf is involved in the transcriptional response to chromium and cadmium in an oxidative stress independent manner. transcriptome analysis of cells under dichromate stress revealed that σf controls a small regulon comprised of eight genes, which are distributed in three transcriptional units. although a conserved domain was predicted for the deduced protein sequence of all σf-dependent genes, only two of these sequences could be assigned to a possible function. the protein encoded by cc <dig> belongs to the group of sulfite oxidases, which catalyze the oxidation of the toxic and very reactive sulfite to the inert sulfate anion <cit> . the product of cc <dig> is a member of the doxx family. although nothing is actually known about the physiological role of bacterial proteins belonging to this family, the archaeal counterparts are involved in the elemental sulfur oxidation pathway <cit> . therefore, both σf-dependent genes with a putative assigned function appear to play a role in sulfate acquisition by cells. interestingly, hu et al. found a strong down-regulation of a caulobacter sulfate abc transport system under chromate and dichromate exposure. while this detoxification strategy apparently contributes to decrease the concentration of chromate and dichromate in the cells <cit> , sulfate uptake from the extracellular environment might be significantly affected. alternative sources such as degradation of sulfur-containing amino-acids <cit> and organosulfonate metabolism <cit> can be used to counteract this sulfur uptake limitation <cit> . it is therefore conceivable that induction of cc <dig> and cc <dig> could supply cells with sulfate. this is consistent with the observation that in arthrobacter sp. strain fb <dig> and pseudomonas putida, chromate exposure also results in increased levels of proteins potentially involved in reversing the effects of cellular sulfur limitation, such as transporters of alternative sulfur sources <cit> . curiously, none of the most representative functional categories up-regulated under chromate, dichromate or cadmium exposure were found to be controlled by σf, indicating that additional molecular systems are engaged in c. crescentus response to these metals. in fact, we previously reported the involvement of the paralogous sigma factors σt and σu in the control of response to chromium and cadmium <cit> and σe in response to cadmium <cit> . the observation that σf, σe and σt/σu regulate distinct sets of genes indicates that each of these sigma factors make a different contribution to the c. crescentus response to metal stress. together, σf, σe, σt and σu are responsible for the induction of 20% of the genes previously found to be up-regulated under cadmium stress and σf, σt and σu control the expression of about 12% of genes induced following caulobacter exposure to chromate or dichromate . therefore, transcriptional regulators other than σf, σe, σt and σu appear to be involved in the response to chromate, dichromate and cadmium. the existence of several molecular systems contributing to the transcriptional response to metal stresses could explain why the absence of sigf, cc <dig> or cc <dig> does not decrease the viability of caulobacter cells under dichromate or cadmium stresses. in agreement, we previously reported that σe elicits a rapid response to cadmium, but cells lacking rpoe are not impaired in survival to this stress condition <cit> . interestingly, sigf is not highly induced under either chromium or cadmium stress, different from what was observed for other ecf sigma factor genes such as rpoe and sigt in c. crescentus <cit> and rpoj, rpok, rpoi, cnrh and rpoq in c. metallidurans <cit> . this indicates that sigf is obviously not strongly auto-regulated under heavy metal stress conditions. although the experimentally determined promoter sequences of sigf and cc <dig> are highly similar to each other, promoter activity analyses supported our observation that cc <dig> is solely regulated by σf, while the sigf operon is transcribed under the control of σf and a still unknown transcriptional regulator. interestingly, both σf and the additional regulator depend on sequences located from − <dig> to + <dig> relative to the transcriptional start site of sigf. an apparent competition between these proteins might be the reason why sigf promoter activity is less responsive to high levels of σf when compared to the cc <dig> promoter, which is solely controlled by σf. the existence of a second regulator of the sigf operon would be important to maintain a certain basal level of σf and consequently to allow a rapid response when cells experience environments contaminated with heavy metals. in the literature, one can find various examples of ecf sigma factor genes dependent on a second ecf sigma factor <cit> . in the present study, we could exclude caulobacter rpoe and sigt as possible regulators of σf, since no difference in sigf expression was observed in the absence of either one of these ecf sigma factor genes. in most cases, the activity of ecf sigma factors is modulated by a cognate anti-sigma factor <cit> . here, we showed that the second gene in the sigf operon acts as a negative regulator of σf function, as overexpression of the putative membrane protein encoded by cc <dig> abolishes the transcriptional activation of sigf and its regulon under dichromate stress. thus, cc <dig> was here denominated nrsf. an interesting question about the nature of σf inhibition came from the observation that most of the protein encoded by nrsf is predicted to lie in the inner membrane of the bacterium: six transmembrane helices separated by five linkers ranging from <dig> to <dig> amino acid residues and an n-terminal segment of <dig> residues. usually, anti-sigma factors bind their cognate sigma factor through an extensive surface interaction, in which a domain of the first protein is sandwiched between domains σ <dig> and σ <dig> of the sigma factor <cit> . it is possible that several of the linkers of nrsf contact σf, resulting in a more stable interaction surface. however, we cannot discard the presence of a third component in this system able to directly bind both σf and nrsf and transduce the signal leading to activation of the sigma factor, to compensate this apparent lack of sufficient cytoplasmic segments in nrsf to contact σf. attempts to obtain soluble recombinant full-length nrsf failed, probably because the protein cannot correctly fold in the absence of the hydrophobic environment found in the membrane compartment of bacterial cells. therefore, it was not possible to test whether the recombinant protein encoded by nrsf directly binds σf. as previously observed for other ecf sigma factors of c. crescentus <cit> , we were not able to delete nrsf, probably due to the toxic effect of high levels of σf under no stress conditions. however, we could isolate strains in which one or both of the conserved cysteine residues of nrsf were replaced for serine. as suggested by western blot analysis, isolation of these point mutation strains was possible probably because most of σf molecules are still directly or indirectly sequestered in an inactive state to the inner membrane by nrsf. substitution of the conserved cysteines might have caused structural changes in nrsf and hence resulting in a lower capacity to bind σf. in fact, σf was found to accumulate in the soluble fraction of cells expressing nrsf mutated in both cysteine residues even when cells were cultured under unstressed conditions. the presence of σf in the soluble fraction was also detected following treatment of parental cells with dichromate. therefore, we could observe accumulation of σf in the soluble fraction in situations in which lower affinity of nrsf for σf is expected. interestingly, two conserved cysteine residues in chrr, the anti-sigma factor of caulobacter σe, were also shown to be important for the response to cadmium mediated by that sigma factor <cit> . furthermore, the sensor histidine kinase phyk, involved in the control of the anti-anti-sigma factor phyr of caulobacter σt, which as mentioned above responds to dichromate and cadmium, also presents a conserved cysteine that is important to phyk activity <cit> . thus, cysteines in the probable sensor proteins of ecf sigma factor mediated systems seem to play a key role in triggering the response to heavy metal stress in c. crescentus. based on the fact that dichromate and cadmium are able to directly bind thiol groups <cit> , it is conceivable that these metals could disrupt contacts mediated by the conserved cysteines of nrsf, leading to changes in its conformation similar to those expected in the mutant proteins with one or both of the cysteine residues substituted. however, activation of σf might also be caused by direct interaction of chromate, dichromate and cadmium with other amino acid residues in nrsf or even with another yet unknown sensory component of the system. the finding that single substitutions of the conserved cysteine residues still allows for induction of σf-dependent genes ruled out the formation of an intramolecular bond between cys <dig> and cys <dig> residues under stress conditions. nevertheless, we could not discard the possibility that nrsf functions as a dimer/multimer using intermolecular bonds for sensing the metals in the extracytoplasmic environment. CONCLUSIONS this report deals with the role and regulation of c. crescentus σf under stress conditions and provides new interesting information about this conserved but still poorly characterized ecf sigma factor: i) σf-dependent genes are induced in the presence of heavy metals in a manner independent of oxidative and disulfide stress; ii) σf directly controls a small regulon including genes involved in sulfur metabolism and iii) σf is negatively regulated by a putative membrane bound protein, here named nrsf, which contains two conserved cysteine residues that are important for its function and are located in the periplasmic portion of the protein.",

RESULTS in the brains of all subjects, pts were found to originate from the primary sensori-motor cortex , and descended through the corona radiata, the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the cerebral peduncle of the midbrain, the anterior pons, and the anterior medulla along the known pathway of the pt. by contrast, in thirty-four of the <dig> hemispheres, apts separated from the pt at the upper midbrain level, descended through the medial lemniscus from the midbrain to the pons, and then rejoined with the pt at the upper medulla. nine of the <dig> apts were found to originate from the primary somatosensory cortex without a primary motor cortex origin. mean values of fractional anisotropy , mean diffusivity , tract volume , and incidence of the apt are summarized in table <dig> fa value and tract volume of the apt were lower than those of the pt. there were significant differences in terms of fa value and tract volume between the pt and the apt in the independent t-test, . likewise, we found significant difference in fa value between the pt and the apt in one-way analysis of covariance . however, no difference in md value was observed in both the independent t-test and ancova . we did not observe any differences in the values of fa , md , and incidence of the apt between the right and left hemispheres in either the pt or the apt . pyramidal aberrant pyramidal values indicate mean . mean diffusivity × 10- <dig> incidence . discussion in the current study, using dtt, we investigated the characteristics of the apt in comparison with the pt. we found the following three results. first, the apt existed in <dig> % of the hemispheres of the normal human brain. second, although all of the pts were found to originate from sm <dig> <dig> % of the apts were found to originate from the primary somatosensory cortex without a primary motor cortex origin. third, values of fa and tract volume for the apt were lower than those of the pt, with no difference in md value. the fa value represents the degree of directionality of microstructures , and the md value indicates the magnitude of water diffusion <cit> . in contrast, the tract volume was determined by the number of voxels contained within the neural tract <cit> . changes in dti parameters observed in the apt, that is, decreased fa value and tract volume with unchanged md value, suggest less directionality and fewer neural fibers than in the pt. like this study, several other studies have reported on the incidence and courses of the apt <cit> . in <dig> using the modified bielschowsky stain, yamashita and yamamoto <cit> investigated the incidence and details of the course of the apt in <dig> consecutive autopsied human brains. they found that all of the <dig> brains examined, with the exception of one brain with holoprosencephaly, showed the apt, and reported that the course of the apt left the pt within the cerebral peduncle and then passed into the medial lemniscus of the pons through the upper medulla. in <dig> hong et al <cit> reported that the apt existed in <dig> of the <dig> hemispheres of normal subjects and that the apt descended through the medial lemniscus from the midbrain to the pons, and then entered into the pt at the upper medulla. recently, several studies have suggested that the apt may contribute to motor recovery in stroke <cit> . in <dig> jang sh reported a patient whose motor function appeared to have recovered via an apt following a pontine infarct located in the pt area <cit> . in <dig> lindenberg et al. demonstrated that patients with alternate motor fibers in the brainstem showed better motor outcome among <dig> patients with middle cerebral artery infarcts <cit> . however, they did not clarify that the alternate motor fibers were apts. in <dig> two patients were reported with midbrain infarct or corona radiata, respectively, that showed motor recovery via apt <cit> . as for the incidence of apt existence, our results coincide with those of hong's dtt study and the course of the apt was similar with that of all previous studies <cit> .

<dig> <cit> and tumor necrosis factor -α <cit> . moreover, airway epithelial cells are believed to contribute to the inflammatory response in the lung, and tlr <dig> has been widely detected on the surface of airway epithelial cells as well as cells of the myeloid lineage, such as macrophages and neutrophils <cit> . some studies have reported that tlr4-deficient mice show increased lung inflammation and higher bacterial load, and tlr <dig> signaling may have a critical function in the fine tuning of inflammation during chronic mycobacterial infection <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that tlr <dig> signaling might participate in the response to acute lung infection. based on our previous findings that p. aeruginosa and s. mitis are the dominant bacteria in the mixture of organisms causing lung infections, these two bacteria were selected for the present study. the aim of our study was to explore the relationship between p. aeruginosa and s. mitis in lung infection and ascertain their roles in the immune response. after acute lung infection mouse models were established, lung bacteriological and histopathological examinations were performed, and total cell counts and levels of related cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were determined. methods bacteria and growth conditions p. aeruginosa strain pao <dig> and s. mitis were used in our study. pao <dig> was kindly provided by professor li shen . s. mitis was purchased from american type culture collection. the bacterial strains were both cultured overnight in brain-heart infusion broth. the s. mitis strain was grown at a neutral ph at 37 °c in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere. the pao <dig> strain was grown at 37 °c on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm. overnight-grown cultures of the strains were standardized to <dig> , and then diluted to a working concentration of od600 = <dig> , if necessary. animals forty c57bl/ <dig> mice were obtained from the experimental animal center of chongqing medical university and housed in the laboratory animal center at the children’s hospital of chongqing medical university. twenty tlr4-deficient mice were obtained from the key laboratory of diagnostic medicine designated by the ministry of education at chongqing medical university. tlr <dig> gene expression was determined by polymerase chain reaction before the experiments to confirm the reliability of the tlr4-deficient mice. the experimental protocol was approved by the animal care and use committee of chongqing medical university. acute lung infection mouse models twenty wild-type mice were randomly divided into four groups treated with: pao <dig> , s. mitis , pao1 + s. mitis , or phosphate-buffered saline . twenty tlr4-deficient mice were divided into the same treatment groups. additionally, another <dig> wild-type mice were subjected to the same treatments and used to estimate the bacterial burden, in order to confirm successful establishment of the acute lung infection mouse models. the mouse models of acute lung infection were established as previously described with some modifications <cit> . briefly, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate before tracheotomy. then they were infected with an intratracheal instillation of 50 μl of bacterial suspension and kept upright in standing posture for 10 s to ensure the bacteria were fully delivered to the lung tissues. finally, the trachea and skin were sutured. the mice were kept for 48 h before sacrificed. lung bacteriological and histological examinations the whole lung of each mouse was homogenized in 1 ml pbs and then serially diluted. a 50-μl sample from each tissue homogenate specimen was cultured quantitatively on columbia sheep blood agar plates overnight at 37 °c in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere, and then the colonies were counted to estimate the number of colony-forming units . the right lungs of the other five mice in each group were fixed in 10% formalin buffer for 48 h, embedded in paraffin, dehydrated, cut into 5-μm slices, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histopathological examination <cit> . images were obtained using light microscopy . total cell counts and cytokine analyses in balf the left lungs were lavaged and collected with 1 ml pbs. the fluid was instilled and withdrawn three times, and then the total cell counts in the balf were determined using a cell counter . balf samples were centrifuged at 3000 g and 4 °c for 5 min. the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-α and il- <dig> in the balf supernatant were determined using mouse cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. statistical analysis statistical analyses were carried out using spss <dig> . analysis of variance was used to identify significant differences among all groups. p < <dig> was considered statistically significant.

however, little change was observed upon infection of wild-type mice with s. mitis, with almost no macrophage infiltration in the lungs . notably, in the pao1 + s. mitis group, moderate lung inflammation was observed, with recruitment of inflammatory cells in the peribronchial wall and surrounding the vessels . similar to wild-type mice, tlr4-deficient mice infected with s. mitis, pao1 +

tlr4-deficient mice infected with pao <dig> only , which is consistent with the results of histological examination of lung tissues. in comparing wild-type and tlr4-deficient mice , we found that the

tnf-α was almost completely inhibited, with no statistically significant differences in expression levels among the four treatment groups . in comparison to il- <dig> and tnf-α expression levels in

in balf of wild-type mice and tlr4-deficient mice and the differences between in tnf-α protein levels wild-type and tlr4-deficient mice are shown discussion as is known, vap is a principal cause of morbidity, mortality, and economic burden in icus. increasing antimicrobial resistance has drawn attention to the failure of antibiotic treatment. recent progress has mainly focused on the pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance of a single strain, specifically p. aeruginosa, on the etts. however, few studies have investigated the interaction of multiple bacteria in the pathogenesis of vap. based on our previous research, we further investigated the presence of s. mitis and p. aeruginosa on the etts. here, for the first time to our knowledge, we found that s. mitis can counteract the inflammatory potential of p. aeruginosa possibly through tlr <dig> signaling in acute lung infection. s. mitis is the most abundant bacteria of the normal human oral flora and also a predominant colonizer of the mucosal site, usually inhabiting the human oral cavity as early as 1–3 days after birth. moreover, except for endocarditis <cit> , s. mitis rarely causes diseases. in our previous research, we found that wild-type mice as well as tlr4-deficient mice infected with an s. mitis strain for 48 h showed little change in pulmonary lesions, supporting the common notion that s. mitis is a normal commensal bacteria in the human oropharynx . in the present study, we observed more severe inflammation in lung tissues accompanied with infiltration of more inflammatory cells in the pao1 + s. mitis group compared with the s. mitis group and pbs control group, but less severe lung inflammation in comparison with that in the pao <dig> group. these findings suggest that in acute lung infection, s. mitis helps to alleviate the inflammatory response so as to reduce the local tissue damage. several studies have found similar effects, in which the bacteria mainly act as “protectors” during the process of infection. recent findings in bifidobacteria and lactobacilli have confirmed that they are effective at reducing allergic symptoms and inhibiting the allergic airway response in murine models of acute airway inflammation <cit> . more important, this inhibition is possibly achieved by regulating tlr signaling <cit> . therefore, we have reason to believe that, unlike the traditional concept in which s. mitis is considered normal commensal bacteria, our results indicate that s. mitis might play a potential protective role in the respiratory tract during acute lung infection. also considering our results in tlr4-deficient mice, we conclude that s. mitis may help alleviate lung inflammation, possibly through modulation of tlr pathway signaling. additionally, the total cell counts in balf are important indicators of the proliferation and differentiation of inflammatory cells. after infection of wild-type mice, total cell counts in the s. mitis group were hardly increased, whereas those in the pao <dig> group were significantly increased compared with the pbs group. these findings are consistent with the results of lung histopathological examination. however, the total cell counts in the pao1+ s. mitis group were slightly lower than those in the pao <dig> group. we speculate that s. mitis might activate some other signaling pathways in the process of promoting inflammatory cells. some studies have found that s. mitis reduces proliferation of t cells specific to an unrelated antigen , which suggests an inhibitory effect of s. mitis. this inhibition can affect either the antigen-presenting cells directly by preventing activation and/or antigen presentation or on the memory th cells directly by interfering with the apc–t cell interaction <cit> . we speculate that this might be one possible explanation for our observations. after infection of tlr4-deficient mice, the total cell counts were significantly lower than those in wild-type mice, which indicates that tlr <dig> expressed on cell surface is needed for inflammatory cell activation <cit> . several studies have demonstrated that tnf-α activates the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules to facilitate migration of neutrophils into inflamed lungs <cit> . similarly, in our acute lung infection mouse models, we found that wild-type mice infected with pao <dig> showed significantly increased tnf-α protein expression as well as increased il- <dig> expression. these findings are consistent with the literature, which supportes that il- <dig> modulates almost every aspect of the innate immune system, including the accumulation of neutrophils at sites of infection or trauma through the control of granulopoiesis <cit> . previous studies have confirmed that tlr <dig> plays a crucial role in the recognition of gram-negative bacteria, but has no obvious effects on gram-positive bacteria <cit> . however, our present study showed that p. aeruginosa together with s. mitis could affect activity of the tlr <dig> pathway. although we examined the tlr <dig> pathway specifically, the roles of other tlr pathways cannot be excluded and should be considered in future investigations. in contrast with our study, wang et al. found an opposite result, which confirmed that s. mitis mainly secrets autoinducer- <dig> to promote biofilm formation and to increase proinflammatory cytokine production, resulting in severe inflammation <cit> . this difference might be attributed to the different infection models. in their study, chronic pneumonia rat models were established by dual-biofilm catheter intubation for 7 days. in contrast, in our study, acute lung infection mouse models were established by planktonic bacteria infection for only 48 h. however, further investigations are needed to elaborate the mechanisms. additionally, we speculate that the conflicting results are related to the protective effects of s. mitis in acute infection, which resulted in reduced cytokine secretion by the host immune system and weakened bacterial clearance, finally resulting in persistent and chronic infection. CONCLUSIONS in conclusion, the results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the co-existence of p. aeruginosa and s. mitis, and for the first time, we demonstrate that s. mitis plays a potentially protective role in the respiratory tract during acute infection. these findings may provide a new perspective in the treatment of p. aeruginosa infection in the nicu. the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of s. mitis remain unknown, and further studies are needed to discover whether this effect is mediated by tlr signaling directly or via some small molecules or whether s. mitis simply competes with pao <dig> for nutrients, limiting pao <dig> replication. abbreviations balfbronchoalveolar lavage fluid cfucolony-forming units ettsendotracheal tubes h&ehematoxylin-eosin lpslipopolysaccharide p. aeruginosa pseudomonas aeruginosa pampspathogen-associated molecular patterns pbsphosphate-buffered saline s. mitis streptococcus mitis tlrtoll-like receptor ttunrelated antigen vapventilator-associated pneumonia we are grateful to professor yibing yin for excellent technical support. funding this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china , which provided money to buy reagents. doctoral degree funding from the chinese ministry of education , and the state key clinic discipline project , which provided money for the labor costs, and the clinical research foundation of children’s hospital of chongqing medical university, which provide the money for article modification. availability of data and materials the data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article. additional data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. authors’ contributions conceived and designed the experiments: cs, jy. performed the experiments: cs, hl, yz. analyzed the data: cs, yz. wrote the paper: cs. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. authors’ information not applicable. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. consent for publication not applicable. ethics approval and consent to participate the experimental protocol was approved by the animal care and use committee of chongqing medical university. publisher’s note springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",

the document, procedures and principles of good clinical practice as detailed in the veterinary international conference on harmonization guideline on good clinical practices —cvmp/vich/595/98; and the guideline on statistical principles for veterinary clinical trials . all owners gave written informed consent to include their cats in the study. animals the inclusion criteria for cats were age ≥6 weeks, body weight <dig> –12 kg, either sex, any breed, presenting for major orthopaedic surgery under general anaesthesia. the exclusion criteria for cats were pregnant or lactating or females intended for breeding; with severe concomitant disorders ; treated before study commencement with local or systemic nsaids or opioids , corticosteroids ; and undergoing repeated surgeries within a few days. randomisation and blinding procedures animals were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups in a 2: <dig> robenacoxib:meloxicam ratio from computer-generated randomisation lists. the 2: <dig> ratio was used to obtain data in more cats receiving robenacoxib and was predicted to cause only a modest reduction in statistical efficiency compared to a 1: <dig> ratio. case allocation was stratified according to the investigation centre and the anticipated duration of surgery . investigators were blinded to the block length, which was six. the robenacoxib and meloxicam solutions for injection have a different appearance. masking was therefore maintained by the ‘blinding by function’ technique: a clinician was responsible for clinical assessments, whereas a separate dispenser was responsible for treatment prescription, administration and compliance control. for the oral treatment, both placebo and robenacoxib tablets had the same appearance and packaging, therefore owners were blinded to the treatment. drugs and administration procedures investigational drugs were a parenteral formulation of robenacoxiba, a tablet formulation of robenacoxibb, a parenteral formulation of meloxicamc and placebo tabletsd. target and actual dosages are listed in table <dig> the s.c. injections of robenacoxib and meloxicam were given between the shoulder blades, shortly before the induction of anaesthesia. owners were instructed to administer tablets either with no food or with only a small quantity of food. cats received once daily one or two tablets containing robenacoxib or placebo for 9 days . there was no mandatory anaesthetic regimen, but times of anaesthetic induction, duration of anaesthesia and recovery from anaesthesia were recorded.table <dig> treatment groups groups number of cats s.c. dosage in mg/kg daily oral dosage in mg/kg* target actual target actual s.c.: subcutaneous. *robenacoxib and placebo tablets were administered once daily for <dig> days. all concomitant treatments were recorded. the use of fluid therapy and antibiotics was permitted. drugs likely to affect efficacy assessments, including all classes of analgesics including other nsaids or corticosteroids were forbidden, except as rescue therapy. study schedule the study schedule is outlined in table <dig> table <dig> dosing and monitoring schedule day 0 day 1 day <dig> to 9 day 10 s.c.: subcutaneous;

in the robenacoxib group, creatinine was decreased; and in the meloxicam group, urea was increased and total protein was decreased. at vf in both the groups, alt, ast and ck were significantly decreased compared with baseline and ap, creatinine, sodium and urea were significantly increased. differences between groups were significant for creatinine and urea with higher values in the meloxicam + placebo group . haematology at v <dig> , red and white cell counts, haemoglobin and haematocrit were significantly increased compared with baseline in the robenacoxib group. at vf, red cell counts, haemoglobin and haematocrit were significantly increased compared with baseline in the robenacoxib group. the only significant change from baseline in the meloxicam + placebo group was a decrease in white cell counts at the vf. the only significant difference between the two treatment groups was lower white cell counts in the meloxicam group . palatability the palatability of the tablets containing robenacoxib was compared with placebo by the dispenser at v <dig> on day <dig> and by the owners daily from day <dig> to the vf. differences between groups were not significant. the mean scores in the robenacoxib and placebo groups were, respectively, <dig> and <dig> for the dispenser and <dig> and <dig> for the owner . discussion the principal finding of this study is that single s.c. injection of robenacoxib before surgery was well tolerated and had statistically non-inferior efficacy in comparison with meloxicam for the management of pain and inflammation associated with orthopaedic surgery in cats. both drugs provided good efficacy, as evidenced from low scores for pain and inflammation post-surgery and low frequency of rescue therapy. the primary end point, the global investigator score, was the unweighted sum of three secondary end points . this end point fulfilled normal distribution assumptions after log transformation, permitting non-inferiority of the robenacoxib injection versus meloxicam to be tested using the powerful parametric rmancova analysis. the relative efficacy of robenacoxib versus meloxicam was <dig> , showing numerical but not significantly superior efficacy of robenacoxib. all five secondary investigator end points showed significant deviation from a normal distribution even after transformation, therefore statistical comparison between groups for these end points had to be based on lack of significant differences using the non-parametric mann–whitney test. meloxicam injection was selected as the positive control as it is registered and extensively used, and its efficacy is documented in the literature in cats. the superiority of meloxicam by injection at the <dig> mg/kg dose versus placebo was demonstrated in experimental models of endotoxin-induced fever <cit> and kaolin-induced fever, pain and inflammation <cit> . the superiority of meloxicam injection in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy was also reported versus placebo and buprenorphine <cit> . in addition, equivalent efficacy of meloxicam has been reported in cats compared with butorphanol for onychectomy <cit> , and compared with carprofen, ketoprofen and tolfenamic acid <cit> , carprofen <cit> and tolfenamic acid <cit> for ovariohysterectomy. therefore, there is sufficient evidence published for the efficacy of meloxicam to control pain and inflammation in cats undergoing orthopaedic surgery to justify its use as a positive control for this study. however, in none of the mentioned published studies were the same scoring schemes used as in our study. in optimally designed non-inferiority studies, the methods and outcome measures should be similar to those used in the original studies of the active control <cit> . although the primary objective of the study was the non-inferiority comparison of robenacoxib injection versus meloxicam injection, the effects of follow-up treatment with robenacoxib tablets for approximately 9 days were assessed as a secondary objective. during the following examinations by the clinician at v <dig> and vf, non-inferior efficacy of robenacoxib versus the control group was demonstrated for pain on palpation and overall pain control. non-inferiority was also shown for inflammation intensity which was assessed at vf. comparison of robenacoxib tablets versus placebo tablets from day <dig> to vf showed low scores on all days with no significant differences between groups. this result may reflect the possibility that a single pre-surgical administration of robenacoxib or meloxicam was sufficient to control post-operative pain and inflammation in most cats. however, it is also recognised that the methods for assessment of efficacy after day <dig> were not optimal; the veterinarians made only assessments at v <dig> and vf, and the owner evaluations assessed animal demeanour and general well-being and did not monitor anti-hyperalgesic actions. the benefit of administration of robenacoxib tablets for 2 days after surgery in cats was demonstrated statistically versus placebo in another study <cit> . anaesthesia and surgery are both potential stressors. therefore plasma cortisol, a stressor glucocorticoid biomarker, was measured at four pre-determined times to compare the effects of the two nsaids. in both the groups, mean values remained relatively constant at the first three sampling times and then increased moderately but significantly at vf. differences between groups were not statistically significant. lower plasma cortisol concentrations post-surgery were reported previously in cats receiving meloxicam compared with butorphanol <cit> , vedaprofen compared with placebo <cit> and fentanyl compared to control <cit> . however, the relevance of plasma cortisol is not clear, as no differences in plasma cortisol concentrations between surgery and control cats were reported in another study <cit> . there were no significant differences in the frequency of reported adverse events in the two groups . several clinical chemistry and haematology variables increased compared with baseline in both the groups, and these changes were attributed to the anaesthetic protocols and surgical procedures rather than the nsaids. the only significant differences between the two groups were higher values for plasma creatinine and urea in the meloxicam group. these results may be type i errors, as the frequency is consistent with the multiple analyses and an alpha value of 5%. the rationale for the development of highly cox- <dig> selective nsaids, such as robenacoxib, is that they should offer the same efficacy but better safety than older less selective nsaids, such as meloxicam <cit> . the finding of no significant differences in tolerability between robenacoxib and meloxicam + placebo in this study is not surprising however, as the study was underpowered to detect differences in safety parameters, with only <dig> cats and a relatively short treatment duration . in addition, we did not include specific safety investigations, for example gastroscopy, which might have revealed differences in tolerability. the major limitations of the study are discussed here. first, the scoring schemes used have not been validated in cats. second, the frequency of assessments was relatively sparse, especially the follow-up from day <dig> onwards, and consisted of daily assessments of the cat’s demeanour and general well-being by the owner. third, with the exception of the primary end point , statistical comparisons of efficacy data had to rely on non-parametric statistics because of lack of normal distribution of the data. reliable non-inferiority analyses could only be performed using rmancova for the primary end point. fourth, the limitations of non-inferiority studies using positive controls are well known <cit> . in our study the proven non-inferiority of robenacoxib versus meloxixam could be due to the fact that both nsaids were similarly effective or ineffective, or alternatively that the study lacked sensitivity. it was judged that the use of a placebo pre-surgery would have been unethical, as a number of nsaids are registered for pre-operative use in cats in the eu and are widely used. in addition, as noted previously, the efficacy of both meloxicam <cit> and robenacoxib <cit> in cats versus placebo has been shown previously a feature of our study was the choice of a non-inferiority threshold value of <dig> . the δ value should reflect the largest margin that is clinically acceptable, but to date no specific guidelines on δ values for veterinary nsaids have been published. in fact, the results show that non-inferior efficacy of robenacoxib to the positive control would also have been achieved if we had defined δ = <dig> for the primary end point, that is with a maximum of 16% difference in the global investigator score. furthermore, robenacoxib had numerical superiority to meloxicam for the primary end point , which supports the conclusion of non-inferior efficacy. CONCLUSIONS single s.c. injection of robenacoxib before surgery had good tolerability and non-inferior efficacy compared with meloxicam for the control of pain and inflammation in cats undergoing orthopaedic surgery. follow-up treatment with oral robenacoxib tablets for approximately 9 days was well tolerated, but there were no differences in the efficacy scores after day <dig> compared with the group receiving meloxicam s.c. followed by placebo control. this might be the result of single pre-surgical administration of robenacoxib leading to adequate control of pain and inflammation in most cats. however, it is also recognised that the methods for assessment of efficacy after day <dig> were not optimal. endnotes aonsior® solution for injection 2%, novartis animal health inc, basel, switzerland. bonsior® non-divisible tablets containing 6 mg of robenacoxib, novartis animal health inc, basel, switzerland. cmetacam® 5 mg/ml injectable, boehringer ingelheim inc, ingelheim, germany. dplacebo tablets manufactured by novartis animal health inc, basel, switzerland with identical appearance to the onsior® tablets abbreviations altalanine aminotransferase apalkaline phosphatase astaspartate aminotransferase ciconfidence interval ckcreatine kinase cox-2cyclo-oxygenase-2 cmaxmaximal concentration eueuropean union mrtmean residence time nrsnumerical rating scale nsaidnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug rmancovarepeated measures analysis of covariance s.csubcutaneous ttime tmaxtime of maximal concentration ukunited kingdom usunited states vvisit vffinal visit competing interests all authors are employees of novartis animal health inc, now owned by elanco animal health, which manufactures and distributes robenacoxib . authors’ contributions the study was designed by jmg and jnk. the study was managed by cs and vs. the statistical analyses were conducted by ws. the manuscript was drafted by jnk. all authors interpreted the results and checked the final manuscript.",

mammals, dna is methylated at the c <dig> position of cytosine residues mainly in cpg dinucleotides in a tissue specific pattern <cit> . dna methylation is an essential process and abnormal methylation is associated with human diseases such as cancer <cit> . dna methylation is intensively studied as illustrated by the finding that a pubmed search for 'dna methylation' retrieved more that <dig> entries. bisulfite genomic sequencing is the standard technique for the analysis of dna methylation at high resolution. in this approach, the genomic dna is treated with sodium bisulfite, which converts all unmethylated cytosines to uracil, whereas the methylated cytosines remain unconverted. the region of interest is amplified by pcr with primers specific for converted dna and the pcr product is sequenced <cit> . detecting a cytosine in the sequence indicates that the respective position was methylated in the original dna whereas a thymine indicates that the respective cytosine was unmethylated. when combined with subcloning and sequencing of individual clones, the dna methylation pattern can be determined at single molecule and nucleotide resolution for continuous tracks of up to <dig> base pairs <cit> . the analysis of the primary bisulfite sequencing data, which should comprise about 20- <dig> subcloned dna molecules for statistical analysis , requires the following tasks: 1) the experimental sequences need to be aligned to the in silico converted genomic reference. 2) the sequence identity and the conversion rate of each experimental sequence need to be measured, and sequences which do not comply with the quality criteria must be removed. 3) clonal sequences, which were amplified from the same template molecule in the pcr, need to be detected and removed. 4) the cpg sites need to be identified in the reference sequence and the aligned experimental sequences. 5) the methylation state of the cpg sites in the experimental sequences needs to be determined and the data summarized and presented. there are different softwares available for the analysis of bisulfite sequencing data, which can be divided into those for analysis of dna methylation in plant such as kismeth <cit> or mammals such as the biq analyzer <cit> and quma <cit> . while plant methylation analysis conceptually deals with cpg and non-cpg methylation, in mammalian bisulfite sequencing analyses cytosines at non-cpg positions are usually considered an artifact of the method and used to measure the conversion rate. here we focus on this approach for bisulfite sequencing data analyses which is assisted by the biq analyzer and quma as well. however, both of these have major drawbacks: • convenience of use: biq analyzer needs installation and has slow performance. • sequence alignment: the biq analyzer sometimes fails to construct the sequence alignment between the experimental and reference sequences without manual user intervention. • filtering for clonal sequences: quma has not implemented a filtering of clonal sequences. the biq analyzer for certain datasets erroneously suggests removing too many sequences as clonal. in addition, the filtering routine of the biq analyzer software erroneously assumes two molecules as non-clonal, which differ by the existence of an unresolved nucleotide annotation only. • identification of cpg sites and annotation of methylation states: the biq analyzer often fails detecting cpg sites which are located downstream of a t-stretch. quma does not check for the presence of the corresponding cpg guanine in the experimental sequences and annotates methylation states at sites with alignment errors, sequencing errors and mutations, like ta, tt, tn, or cn. • the genetic diversity among repetitive sequences requires a different strategy for analysis of the bisulfite sequencing data which is not provided by any software so far. therefore, we developed a new software called bisulfite sequencing dna methylation analysis . bisma provides a highly automated, simple and fast workflow for the analysis of bisulfite sequencing experiments. it can be used for the analysis of subcloned pcr products from unique and repetitive genomic regions. all uploaded data will be automatically processed, filtered for sequence identity, conversion rate and clonal sequences and analyzed. bisma has implemented an improved strategy for detection of clonal sequences, which preserves identical methylation patterns and ignores n-sites during pattern analysis. furthermore, bisma has implemented a new algorithm for detection of cpg sites in the bisulfite sequencing data. we embedded the bisma software in the existing dna methylation data analysis platform bdpc, which allows for further downstream data processing, compilation, web presentation and statistical analysis of results <cit> as well as clustering and graphical data presentation <cit> . the bisma software is a freely available online tool for academic purposes http://biochem.jacobs-university.de/bdpc/bisma/. implementation dataset and software comparison biological samples were obtained and treated as described before <cit> . published primary sequencing data of the amplicons 51_new <dig> <dig> <dig> 327_iii and <dig> were used for comparison of the programs <cit> . treatment of cells with 5-azacytidine was performed as described before <cit> . bisulfite treatment, pcr-product purification, subcloning and sequencing was done as described <cit> . briefly, about 200- <dig> ng genomic dna were digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme at 37°c overnight to facilitate the subsequent denaturation process, then the dna was converted with sodium bisulfite in a thermocycler for <dig> min at 99°c, <dig> min at 50°c, <dig> min at 99°c, <dig> h at 50°c, <dig> min at 99°c, <dig> h at 50°c. the converted dna was used as a template for pcr. the pcr products were purified by chargeswitch pcr clean-up kit and subcloned using the strataclone kit . a high number of clones for each amplicon were sequenced. the xist promoter was amplified using the following primers: from tailtip dna of a female mouse. the alu regions were targeted using the published primer set <cit> without the 5'-overhangs . the analysis was performed using the matching region of the alu-sx subfamily consensus sequence . we downloaded, installed and used the biq analyzer v <dig> software on a core duo l <dig> computer with a <dig> gigahertz processor and <dig> gigabyte installed random-access memory on a microsoft windows xp professional operation system. we installed java runtime environment version <dig> update <dig> . we used the remote-clustalw option such that all multiple sequence alignments were performed on a server at the max planck institute for informatics. we used 95% and 90% as lower threshold for the conversion rate and the sequence identity in all three programs for comparison. bisma software implementation bisma is a php coding language based web application which manages the sequencing data information using a mysql database for temporary storage. currently, bisma is running on an opensuse <dig> linux web server. if sequences in abi file format are uploaded to bisma the dna sequence is automatically extracted from the abi files as they were edited by the user. for this task bisma uses the perl module bio::trace::abif <cit> . all pair wise and multiple sequence alignment steps in the bisma software are performed using the clustalw software <cit> . after the alignment, bisma compares each uploaded sequence with the reference or consensus sequence to calculate the sequence identity, the conversion rate and the occurrence of gaps. sequences which do not pass the user defined threshold will be excluded from further analysis. bisma uses the following default quality filtering thresholds for the analysis of unique genomic sequences: sequence identity 90%; conversion rate 95%; gaps 20%. for the analysis of repetitive sequences bisma uses the following default thresholds: sequence identity 70%; conversion rate: sequences with <dig> and more unconverted cytosines in <dig> bps are excluded; gaps: 20%. RESULTS the bisma software is designed for upload of primary bisulfite sequencing datasets derived after subcloning of pcr products from unique and repetitive sequences. bisma has implemented automatically sequence processing, alignment, filtering for sequence quality, filtering of clonal sequences, data analysis and presentation. uploading and sequencing data processing sequencing data can either be directly uploaded in abi file format, as text files containing the extracted sequence or as a single multi-fasta file . for the uploading process of separated sequencing files, these files need to be archived using the zip standard, which is implemented in current desktop operation systems from microsoft, apple and many free linux distributions. currently, the total size of all uploaded files is limited to <dig> mb, which corresponds to approximately <dig> sequences in original abi format. bisma automatically prepares two pair wise sequence alignments of the submitted sequence and its reverse complement to the in silico converted reference sequence. based on the quality of the alignments, bisma determines the correct sequence direction and automatically removes the vector sequence. pair-wise alignments of the reference sequence with the experimental sequences are used to create an alignment of all sequences. this strategy is significantly faster than a clustalw multiple sequence alignment and a similar algorithm is implemented in the quma software. in principle, such strategy is favorable, since the reference sequence and the experimental sequences of a bisulfite sequencing data set are not of equal weight, but each experimental sequence needs to be compared with the reference sequence. however, we observed that a clustalw multiple sequence alignment sometimes will provide a better alignment than the combination of pair-wise alignments. the massive occurrence of thymine after bisulfite conversion and pcr leads to the presence of long poly-t stretches, which often cause pcr and sequencing artifacts in form of thymine insertions or deletions. under these circumstances the combined pair wise alignments often fail at the last cpg position. therefore, with default settings bisma automatically will apply a clustalw multiple sequence alignment if a cpg site is close to the end of the pcr product and associated with a t-stretch. beside this, the user can manually choose between pair wise and clustalw multiple sequence alignment. quality control of aligned sequences bisma automatically determines for each sequence the degree of identity to the reference sequence, the conversion rate, the appearance of insertions and deletions and the number of unresolved nucleotides at reference sequence cytosine positions, which are in general an indication of low sequence quality . these parameters are then used for quality control filtering and sequences which do not pass user defined thresholds will be excluded. recently, non-cpg methylation has been reported for mammalian cell lines as well which seems to be correlated with the degree of differentiation <cit> . although bisma has a cpg centered approach of data analysis, it can be used for initial visualization of sequences with non-cpg methylation. if this is intended, the threshold of the conversion rate needs to be lowered manually, because otherwise clones with high non-cpg methylation will be excluded because of low conversion. as bisma does not analyze non-cpg methylation, it might be considered to use the plant methylation analysis softwares kismeth <cit> or cymate <cit> for this task. however, discrimination of non-cpg methylation from incomplete conversion in mammalian cell types requires careful controls and ideally additional experimental evidence. cpg site detection and annotation of the methylation state bisma uses an improved strategy for detection of cpg site positions in the experimental sequences when compared to the biq analyzer and quma. briefly, bisma first checks if a cpg guanine is present in the experimental sequence at the appropriate position and only then determines the methylation state of the cpg site using the sequencing result of the next base in 5' direction. this strategy allows correct and reliable evaluation of the methylation state and resolves cases of deletions or insertions of thymine by pcr artifacts. as introduced above, such artifacts frequently happen during amplification of t-stretches in the bisulfite converted dna. bisma displays the multiple sequence alignment including the annotation of the methylation pattern, unconverted cytosines and possible clonal molecules for visual inspection . filtering for clonal sequences one important caveat of bisulfite methylation analysis is the possibility of amplifying single converted dna molecules , which after subcloning of the pcr product and sequencing of individual clones, could give rise to several identical sequence reads. therefore, bisma performs a second filtering to remove such clonal sequences by preparing a pair wise comparison of the cytosine patterns of all sequences . bisma ignores n-sites during this procedure, because they indicate bad sequencing data quality and are not suitable to discriminate between cytosine patterns. if two sequences have the same cytosine pattern, these molecules might be either the result of clonal pcr or represent an identical methylation pattern in different template molecules. removing all sequences with an identical cytosine pattern, therefore, may lead to the erroneous elimination of clones with identical methylation patterns . this potential mistake is critical in highly methylated or unmethylated pcr products. in contrast, identical patterns of methylation and unconverted cytosines in non-cpg context, which in human dna usually are considered bisulfite conversion artifacts, always is a clear indication of clonal pcr. therefore, bisma removes such sequences with default settings, but it keeps those sequences where the identical cytosine pattern is restricted to cpg sites. however, the user can change the mode of filtering of clonal sequences and manually edit the selection of sequences to be included in the final analysis . it should be noticed, however, that there is no absolute safe way for filtering of clonal molecules; in critical cases the pcr reaction on the bisulfite converted dna has to be repeated to resolve this issue experimentally. final output of analyzed data the bisma output consists of the following elements: 1) an annotated alignment, 2) a graphical display of the methylation pattern in context of the cpg site distribution in the reference sequence, 3) a graphical display of the condensed methylation pattern, 4) a graphical display of the average methylation at each cpg site, 5) statistics about the overall methylation percentage and the percentage of cpg sites analyzed and 6) the overall methylation percentage of each clone. bisma will automatically sort the sequences in the alignment and all output files and graphical presentations by their methylation level, if selected by the user. bisma has implemented a threshold for the average methylation report of individual cpg sites, such that only statistics are calculated and reported if at least <dig> experimental sequences could be analyzed at the respective site. this avoids over-interpretation and propagation of weak data points. all statistics and the alignment are combined in one html file for data storage, presentation and further manual or automatic downstream analysis. for example, the output files of many analyses can be combined and submitted to the bdpc compilation software on the same server. methylation analysis of bisulfite sequencing data from repetitive sequences the methylation state of repetitive genomic sequences is frequently investigated using bisulfite genomic sequencing as a measurement of global methylation difference or to determine the repeat specific methylation . different approaches have to be used for the investigation of the methylation state of unique and repetitive genomic sequences, because the genomic reference for a repeat sequence is not defined as these elements are present in many copies with similar but not identical sequences. for example, a single primer pair designed to determine the methylation of alu sequences will amplify pcr-products from about <dig> template regions in bisulfite converted human dna <cit> . as a consequence, the genomic origin of each amplified molecule is unknown, such that it cannot be directly compared with a defined reference sequence. therefore, the standard approach for the analysis of unique sequences, where each cpg position is compared against its genomic reference sequence and the methylation state of each cpg site can be determined, is not an option in the analysis of sequencing data from repetitive genomic sequences. instead, with repeats a consensus sequence has to be used for sequence alignment and analysis. however, this does not allow distinguishing an unmethylated cpg site from one that is mutated to tg. furthermore, the experimental sequences may contain additional cpg sites which are not present in the consensus. to determine the methylation state of repetitive sequences, bisma has implemented two strategies. the first approach uses the consensus sequence for validation of the amplified sequences and sequence alignment only. the bisma software for repetitive sequences extracts the position of methylated cpg sites in the aligned experimental sequences and calculates the number of methylated cpg per sequence, which can be located at consensus and non consensus positions. for each sequence, the following information is stored in the output file: the sequence identifier, the number of methylated cpg sites found in the sequence, and the position of each methylated cytosine in the aligned sequence. the methylated cytosines are plotted in an overview graph . sequences are sorted according to the number of methylated cpg sites. bisma visualizes the cpg sites at the consensus sequence positions in black, while those at non consensus positions are plotted in red. bisma also displays and stores the distribution of methylated cpg sites among sequences and the corresponding average occurrence of methylated cpgs in <dig> bps . to illustrate the functionality of the new bisma software for analysis of repetitive sequences, we amplified a short region of the alu repetitive element from bisulfite converted dna from various samples and used the matching part from the alu-sx subfamily consensus sequence <cit> for data analysis. as shown in figure <dig> we observed high methylation in the alu sequences from peripheral blood leukocytes, cultured fibroblast cells, the immortalized cell line hek <dig> and the human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line hepg <dig> which is in agreement with literature data on the methylation state of the alu sequences <cit> . in spite of this, several molecules were found without methylation or low methylation especially in hepg <dig> and even more pronounced after treatment of hek <dig> cells with 5-azacytidine. such observation is consistent with reported loss of global methylation during cancer progression <cit> , which for example was documented especially for the line <dig> repetitive element in hep-g <dig> <cit> . as an alternative analysis strategy, we implemented the estimation of the overall methylation as introduced by yang et al. <dig> <cit> . this method focuses on the consensus cpg positions. it estimates the rate of cg to tg mutations in the sequenced strand by determining the number of cg to ca mutations, which corresponds to cg to tg exchanges in the opposite strand. assuming that the mutation rate is similar in both dna strands, the number of unmethylated cpg sites can be calculated by correcting the number of tg sites by the fraction of mutated sites. then, the overall dna methylation percentage is calculated from the number of unmethylated and methylated cpg positions. using our test dataset from leukocytes, we obtained an overall methylation of alu repeats of <dig> %, which is higher than reported previously <cit> . such difference might be in the range of inter-individual variation or result from the absence of the 5'-overhangs in the primers used here. comparison of bisma with existing bisulfite sequencing analysis programs we used datasets from published results <cit> for the human genes s100b, ncam <dig> col6a <dig> znf <dig> and h2bfs to compare the performance of the new bisma software for unique sequences with the biq analyzer and quma showing examples of improved cpg site detection and methylation state annotation and filtering for clonal molecules . a summary of the comparison of the bisma software with the biq analyzer and quma software is shown in figure <dig> bisma is the only software which supports the analysis of bisulfite sequencing data from repetitive sequences. all three programs can be used free of charge for academic purpose. the online tools quma and bisma do not require an installation on the user's computer, while the biq analyzer requires an installation in a java runtime software environment. the result files of the bisma software for analysis of unique sequences and the biq analyzer are capable for direct web presentation and are compatible with the bdpc compilation software. quma and bisma automatically sort the clones in the multiple sequence alignment, the output files and figures by methylation. for comparison of the analysis time, we measured the time needed for the automated analysis. when comparing the average processing time, quma is slightly faster than bisma but the biq analyzer is significantly slower . however, quma's analysis algorithm has not implemented the filtering of clonal molecules, which might explain the slightly faster performance. the main reason for the gain of speed of the quma and bisma programs when compared with the biq analyzer is the automatic detection of the sequence direction and vector sequence removal, which is implemented in bisma and quma. another aspect for the increase in speed is the use of pair wise alignments of the reference sequence to the experimental sequences. this strategy is faster than a multiple sequence alignment especially with large number of sequences. a choice between different alignment methods is a unique feature of bisma. all three programs support uploading of sequencing files in text format. however, bisma is the only software which supports direct uploading of abi sequencing data. all three tools identify and remove improper sequencing results based on sequence identity and conversion rate. in addition, quma and bisma remove sequences with insertions or deletions which do not pass the user defined threshold. only bisma directly filters clones for n-sites at cytosine positions as well. all three programs provide an annotated alignment of all sequence of the final dataset. the accurate determination of the methylation state of each aligned cpg position is one of the most important tasks during analysis of bisulfite sequencing data. the new bisma software has implemented an improved algorithm for cpg site detection, which detected all positions accurately. the biq analyzer fails if the methylation site under investigation is not directly aligned with the respective cytosine position, which frequently happens in aligned bisulfite sequencing results at t-stretches . the quma software erroneously reports a methylation result of mutated and unknown positions . the biq analyzer and bisma programs offer filtering of clonal molecules, while the quma software does not check for clonal sequences and it includes obvious examples of clonal pcr for methylation analysis . however, bisma has implemented an improved algorithm that keeps clones with identical cytosine patterns, which do not have conversion artifacts. more stringent filtering as implemented in the biq analyzer inappropriately removes valid methylation patterns . bisma ignores n-sites during filtering of clonal sequences, which is not implemented in the biq analyzer . therefore, the filtering routine of the biq analyzer leads to preferential analysis of sequences with conversion artifacts and bad sequencing data quality. this is critical when analyzing highly methylated or unmethylated regions. to illustrate the functionality of the improved filtering for clonal sequences, we isolated dna from mouse tail tip, converted it with sodium bisulfite and amplified a part of the xist promoter from a female animal . in females, the xist promoter is methylated on the active x-chromosome, while unmethylated on the other chromosome which is subject to x-chromosome-inactivation. therefore, the expected methylation pattern consists of half methylated and half unmethylated clones <cit> . as shown in figure 3c, the strict filtering of identical cytosine patterns led to the removal of many clones and artificially created a heterogeneous methylation pattern, which might mislead the interpretation. in contrast, the data analyzed with the modified settings nicely reflect the true methylation pattern. bdpc as an integrated platform for bisulfite sequencing dna methylation analyses bdpc is a platform, which assists the full dna methylation analysis workflow . the embedded bisma software for unique sequences is useful for single pcr product analysis. its result files can be collected and directly submitted to the bdpc compilation software, which integrates methylation data of cpg sites on the level of amplicons <cit> . it displays the whole dataset in form of an html presentation, which can be linked to the versatile ucsc genome browser. finally, large methylation analysis projects often aim to compare the compiled data among the samples analyzed and need condensed pictures for data presentation. these demands are supported by the bdpc clustering software, which prepares a heatmap of all methylation data clustered by the amplicon methylation state and a tissue clustering, which is plotted in a dendrogram <cit> . CONCLUSIONS the bisma software supports the analysis of subcloned pcr products from bisulfite sequencing experiments. it has implemented an improved strategy for detection of clonal sequences and a new algorithm for detection of cpg sites. bisma is the first software which supports analysis of bisulfite sequencing from repetitive genomic regions. the highly automated and simple workflow of the bisma software minimizes the required user interactions to successfully analyze the dataset within a short time. bisma provides full user control and allows adjusting the thresholds of many parameters and selection of the final dataset on the basis of an annotated sequence alignment. the bisma software can be freely used as an online tool for academic purposes at http://biochem.jacobs-university.de/bdpc/bisma/. availability and requirements project name: bisma project home page: http://biochem.jacobs-university.de/bdpc/bisma/ operating system: platform independent online software license: source code available upon request for academic use any restrictions to use by non-academics: licence needed abbreviations bdpc: bisulfite sequencing data presentation and compilation; bisma: bisulfite sequencing dna methylation analysis software; bps: base pairs; ucsc genome browser: university of california santa cruz genome browser; n-sites: unresolved nucleotide sites in sequencing reads authors' contributions cr and aj conceived project and wrote the manuscript. cr wrote the bisma source code. cr, yz and rr performed the experiments. cr conducted the statistical analyses. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. supplementary material additional file 1 supplemental text s <dig> correlation between number of analyzed clones and precision of the estimate of biological methylation levels. supplemental text s <dig> examples in literature for bisulfite sequencing of subcloned pcr-products obtained from repetitive elements. supplemental text s <dig> improved cpg site detection and improved annotation of the methylation state. supplemental text s <dig> improved cpg site detection. supplemental text s <dig> improved annotation of the methylation state. supplemental text s <dig> automatic detection of clonal molecules. supplemental text s <dig> improved detection of clonal molecules avoids inappropriate filtering of valid sequences. supplemental text s <dig> improved detection of clonal molecules ignores n-sites at cytosine positions. supplemental figure s <dig> complete alignment of all bisulfite sequencing data used to create the results shown in figure 3c. click here for file acknowledgements technical assistance of ms. sandra becker and the web server capacities of the jacobs university including its maintenance by dr. achim gelessus are gratefully acknowledged. we acknowledge dr. tomasz p. jurkowski for discussions about implementation of sequencing data extraction and alignment tools in web applications. this work was supported by the ngfn <dig> program of the german minister of research and education .",

    "prompt": "Write a summary of the research hypothesis and results. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND the presence of premature stop codons in tumorsupressor and mismatch repair genes are a very frequent cause of hereditary cancer that account for 50%-90% of the reported pathogenic mutations <cit> . pscs are observed in the apc gene related to familial adenomatous polyposis <cit> , the brca <dig> and <dig> genes related to familial breast cancer <cit> and the mismatch repair genes related to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer <cit> . pscs are produced by nonsense or frameshift mutations resulting in the premature termination of proteins <cit> . these truncated proteins can either loose completely their function producing haploinsufficiency in the cell or acquire a dominant negative effect on the full-length protein produced by the wild type allele <cit> . in most cases, both consequences are pathologic. the mentioned genes related to hereditary cancers show an extremely heterogeneous mutation spectrum, but although the alterations are scattered throughout the complete coding sequence, most of the identified mutations produce premature termination of protein translation <cit> . the detection of mutations in genomic dna is one of the most common diagnosis methods used for these diseases – e.g. sscp, dgge, ha – <cit> . these techniques have the advantage of using only dna -an easy to handle molecule- and have widely proved their usefulness. still, they have their limitations. they reveal all sequence changes, including silent mutations and polymorphisms without pinpointing the type of mutation. therefore, subsequent analyses are sometimes needed to distinguish between pathologic mutations and polymorphisms <cit> . the other major diagnosis methods are based on the detection of the protein product, and they have the advantage of detecting exclusively pathologic mutations. the translation machinery is exquisitely sensitive to pscs that terminate the process of protein elongation. the analysis of the truncated proteins can be done in vitro – e.g. protein truncation test – by starting from either genomic dna or rna, amplifying the sequence to be analyzed, and using these products as templates for in vitro transcription and translation <cit> . the shorter products of the mutated alleles are then distinguished from the full-length protein products of normal alleles. a disadvantage of the conventional ptt is the involvement of sds-page followed by autoradiography or western blotting. as it relies on visual inspection to detect the mobility of shifted bands, it may also be subject to evaluator error. another limitation of the method is the lack of sensitivity to diagnose mutations near the translation end that produce too small mobility shifts to be detected <cit> . the ptt test is based on cell-free transcription and translation. however, the same machinery is present and functional in living cells. therefore, in principle, it would be possible to carry out the diagnosis by using the translation machinery of cells. several models have been developed in the past that use living-system strategies. for these methods, pcr amplifications of consecutive fragments of the gene are introduced in a reporter-plasmid, which is then transformed into yeast or bacteria <cit> . the dna to be tested is ligated upstream an easily detectable protein. the presence of a psc in the sequence will stop translation prematurely and prevent the expression of the reporter protein. the so called \"yeast-based stop codon assay\" has been reported for the detection of chain-terminating mutations in some specific genes. the pcr-amplified coding sequence is inserted by homologous recombination into a yeast expression vector system, and transformants are assayed for growing in a nutrition-deficient medium. to allow the insertion of the dna sequence by homologous recombination, a gap-vector must be previously generated to introduce homologous flanking sequences for the posterior recombination insertion step. therefore, this method requires the construction of an expression vector that is specific for each tested sequence , and hence is not applicable to a new candidate gene. a modification made by kataoka et al <cit> , consists of the development of a universal gap-vector to permit the automatic integration of any gene fragment. each primer used to amplify the sequence of interest carries a 24bp recombination tail. however, this method requires performing a nested pcr to reduce nonspecific amplification products; hence, it has many steps for a routine diagnosis. bacteria have the advantage of being easier to manipulate than yeast. however, even though some authors have reported the development of bacterial systems based on the cloning of relevant segments in-frame with a colorimetric marker gene <cit> , no data was found reporting their application in routine diagnosis. a problem with this strategy is the capability of bacteria to re-initiate translation downstream of the stop, causing expression of the reporter even in the presence of a psc <cit> . the aim of this work was to develop an alternative methodology to detect pscs in human genes using the transcription and translation machinery of bacteria while avoiding the translation re-initiation interference. the strategy was to introduce the dna to be tested in a linker between the two fragments of the catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase of bordetella pertussis, used for the bacterial two-hybrid system developed by karimova et al <cit> . re-initiation events will render two separate cya domains catalytically inactive. our results show that the plasmid is a sensitive, specific, efficient and low-cost tool for the detection of pscs and that it is insensitive to re-initiation artifacts. RESULTS development of the recombinant preal plasmid our aim was to develop an alternative methodology to detect pscs in a human gene based on its fusion with a reporter gene and on bacterial phenotype screening. previous developments in this field produced false-negative results, probably due to translation re-initiation events, so we designed a recombinant plasmid in order to avoid this artifact. the strategy was based on the bacterial two-hybrid system developed by karimova et al <cit> to identify interacting proteins. in essence, when the catalytic domain of bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase is expressed in e. coli, it exhibits a strong unregulated basal activity that results in camp synthesis which, in turn, can trigger the expression of lacz-regulated genes <cit> . interestingly, the catalytic domain is composed of two independent fragments that are not able to re-associate and interact . however, when both fragments are genetically fused to two proteins of interest, each on different plasmids, the interaction between the two proteins results in functional complementation between the two adenylate cyclase fragments leading to camp synthesis . functional analysis of bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase activity can be easily monitored in an e. coli strain deficient in endogenous adenylate cylcase on indicator plates . we reasoned that if we constructed a unique plasmid containing both complementary fragments of the reporter enzyme linked by a subcloned human gene of interest, the adenylate cyclase would be functional only in absence of any psc in the subcloned dna fragment. in the absence of psc in the linker, the two domains would be synthesized as a single polypeptide with adenylate cyclase activity . a psc in the dna fragment would stop translation and the second domain required for adenylate cyclase activity would not be present. any possible translation re-initiation event downstream the pscs would yield physically unattached fragments that should not be able to re-associate, and hence would not result in a false negative result . the two cya domains expressed as a single polypeptide are catalytically active to test the hypothesis that the linked domains of the two-hybrid system translated from a single plasmid would have adenylate cyclase activity, we amplified fragment t <dig> from plasmid pkt <dig> of the bacterial two-hybrid system, and inserted it upstream and in frame with fragment t <dig> in plasmid put <dig> to obtain preal. part of the existing mcs present in this plasmid was preserved to facilitate the insertion of human gene fragments . we transformed an e. coli strain , deficient in adenylate cyclase, with preal and plated the transformants on macconkey medium. we used as control bth <dig> transformed with put <dig> the results revealed that the bth <dig> transformed with the preal expressed adenylate cyclase activity . in contrast, control plates, transformed with put <dig> that expressed only the c-terminal domain of cya, showed 100% white colonies . this result confirmed the correct in-frame insertion of t <dig> upstream t <dig> and the functional catalytic activity of both domains attached by a short fragment of <dig> amino acids. the system can accurately detect psc in human dna fragments to test whether preal could be used to detect pscs in human genes, three different fragments of exon <dig> of the brca <dig> gene were amplified from a healthy donor. reported pathogenic stop mutations related to breast and ovarian cancer were introduced by a mutagenic pcr strategy using the wild type dna as template <cit> . a nonsense and a frameshift mutation were generated introducing the alterations with two different forward primers. a wild type version was used as control. all forward primers had bamhi site overhangs and the reverse primer had a 5' ecori site to facilitate insertion in the mcs of preal. the annealing site of the reverse primer was carefully selected to include atg and gtg codons post psc and in-frame with t <dig> in order to detect translation re-initiation events. after inserting the different pcr products in preal, the bth <dig> cells were transformed and plated on lb-x-gal medium. as expected, all bacteria carrying the wild-type insert showed a blue phenotype whereas the bacteria carrying the inserts with psc showed a white phenotype . the experiments showed consistent results either on macconkey or on lb-xgal media, confirming that the insertion of a 377– <dig> bp human sequence allows the functional interaction of fragment t <dig> with fragment t <dig> the results also show that any psc in the dna linker inhibits the catalytic activity of adenylate cyclase. most of the psc mutations in tumor suppressor and mismatch repair genes causing hereditary diseases are present in a single allele. therefore, any diagnosis system should be able to detect these mutations in heterozygous patients. to mimic a heterozygous pcr product, we mixed in a 1: <dig> proportion preal/wildtype and preal/nonsense and transformed the bth <dig> with this mix. when plated on macconkey, the phenotypes showed an equal proportion of white and red , whereas the control plates of bth <dig> transformed with preal/wildtype showed 100% red colonies . to confirm that the inserts of the white colonies had different sequences from those of the red colonies, we amplified dna directly from the colonies touching with a single pipette tip a red and a white colony. the resulting mixed pcr product was heat denatured, and allowed to re-hybridize at low temperature. finally, the mixed dna product was ran in a non-denaturing page. we expected the formation of homoduplexes in case of a mix with identical sequences, and the detection of heteroduplexes in case of a mix with different sequences. the heteroduplexes are easily detectable by their delayed mobility on an electrophoresis assay. the page showed the formation of heteroduplexes only in the mixed product, confirming that it contained different sequences . in conclusion, these experiments indicate that insertion of a psc-containing dna in preal is easily detected by bacterial colony phenotype and that the assay is suitable for analyzing heterozygous samples. pscs were accurately detected even in the presence of re-initiation events we speculated that the developed diagnosis system would be resistant to translation re-initiation, a common event in bacteria. to detect whether translation re-initiation events were occurring in our system, we used a murine anti-adenylate cyclase monoclonal antibody that binds to the distal portion – amino acids 373– <dig> – of fragment t <dig> . our hypothesis was that, in the absence of psc, a large product would be detected by the antibody, whereas in the presence of psc, if translation re-initiations occurred, smaller products recognized by the antibody should appear. western blot assays were performed on extracts from bth <dig> transfected with empty preal, preal/wt, preal/fs and preal/ns. the results in figure <dig> show that small fragments recognized by the antibody were present in all samples, indicating that translation initiation downstream the stop codon was frequent and that it occurred even in the dna fragment lacking psc. a careful analysis of the sizes showed that they were consistent with the atg and gtg codons present in the linker. however, it is worth noting that the full-length product was only present in the adenylate cyclase positive bacteria. the results show that translation re-initiation is a frequent event under the conditions of the assay and that a reporter gene located downstream the inserted dna would not be a good method to detect pscs. this observation stresses the importance of the preal two-domain strategy developed to detect stop codons in the inserted dna. the system correctly detects a truncating mutation in a hnpcc patient the preal plasmid has proved to be very efficient to detect stop codons introduced in exon <dig> of the brca <dig> gene of a wild type dna, even in heterozygous samples. we wanted to test the system with another gene and in a more realistic situation. for this propose, exon <dig> of the msh <dig> gene was amplified from dna obtained from peripheral blood of a patient from a hnpcc family. this family presents a mutation on codon <dig> of this gene. the pcr product was inserted in frame in the mcs of preal. note that the patient was heterozygous; hence, the pcr product contained both, the mutated and the wild type alleles. dna of an unaffected member of the hnpcc family was used as control. in this instance, transformation of bth <dig> was performed directly with the ligation product avoiding a previous miniprep purification step in order to simplify the method. to improve the amount of transformants, the culture expansion time was increased to <dig> h. after <dig> h of incubation on macconkey at 37°c, the transformants with the dna from an unaffected individual showed <dig> colonies/cm2; all of them with a red phenotype . in contrast, transformants from the heterozygous patient showed <dig> white colonies/cm <dig> and <dig> red colonies/cm <dig> . the results clearly indicate that the method accurately identifies a psc-containing dna segment even in the presence of a non-mutated allele. to confirm the genotype of the different colonies, a pcr from red and white colonies and subsequent restriction enzyme incubation was performed. the results shown in figure 6b confirm the presence of the wild type insert in red colonies and the mutated allele in white colonies . in the assay with the brca <dig> exon, the reverse primer was designed in order to include atg and gtg sequences on purpose to test the robustness of the method to translation re-initiation problems. we assessed the occurrence of re-initiation in this more realistic assay with the dna amplified from a patient. western blot assays revealed the presence of re-initiation events in red and white colonies , proving that a simpler plasmid, based on the expression of a single reporter would have strong limitations due to re-initiation events. notice that, as expected, white colonies do not express the full-length adenylate cyclase . these observations show that the preal strategy can be used in a relatively simple diagnostic scheme: pcr amplification from genomic dna from patients, ligation into preal, transformation with the ligation product into bth <dig> and bacterial phenotype screening in macconkey or lb-xgal media. discussion the diagnosis of hereditary diseases by molecular biology methods has proved to be a powerful tool for the managing of affected families and, in many cases, for the treatment of affected members. with a growing number of genes identified as related to specific syndromes, these methods are of great interest to the medical community. although feasible, the complete sequencing of the suspected gene is still not efficient. moreover, many mutations may be normal polymorphisms without pathological significance. morbid mutations are frequently related to inactivation of the gene product by the conversion of wild type triplets to stop codons, or changes in the reading frame that usually introduce stop codons. therefore, the detection of pscs in disease-related genes is usually of great importance for the diagnosis of hereditary diseases. we describe here a bacterial system that allows the detection of pscs in human genes by a simple colony phenotype screening. the idea was originated in the two-hybrid system based on a reconstituted signal transduction pathway in bacteria, developed by karimova et al <cit> in the pasteur institute. in our design, the in vivo translation of bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase fragments linked by a psc-free inserted dna triggers the expression of camp-dependent genes. we took advantage of the fact that the t <dig> and t <dig> fragments are unable to recognize each other and cannot reconstitute a functional enzyme when expressed as separate entities. however, if they are attached by a polypeptide chain, the protein is active and camp is synthesized. ultimately, camp, upon binding to cap, activates the transcription of catabolic operons, allowing the bacteria to ferment carbohydrates such as maltose or lactose. we show here that any psc in the dna inserted between the adenylate cyclase fragments inhibits the activity of the translation product. we also show that translation re-initiation events do occur and that the preal system is resistant to this source of false negative results. indeed, re-initiation was a very common event observed even in sequences lacking pscs. we showed by western blot that most of the possible initiation codons in the inserted fragment were used and generated a detectable polypeptide in the assay. patients with hereditary mutations in tumor suppressor genes are always heterozygous, because homozygous individuals are unviable. hence, a mixed pcr product is obtained when dna from these patients is amplified. however, a single pcr product is inserted per copy of the preal plasmid; in turn, only one preal copy transforms a cya- bacterium that expands in a clone on the plate. therefore, each colony represents one allele. in conclusion, this method allows the analysis of separated alleles of heterozygous patients, avoiding possible allele-interfering events affecting other mutation detection systems <cit> . for the application of the preal plasmid, we propose a diagnosis algorithm starting from genomic dna extracted from peripheral blood of index patients suspected of fap, hnpcc, familial breast cancer, or any other disease related to pscs. each exon should be amplified with specific primers carrying endonuclease cleavage sequences. the amplification products should be subsequently inserted into preal, and bth <dig> cells transformed directly with the ligation product. after plating on macconkey for <dig> hours, heterozygous exons with a psc in one allele would be detected by a 50/ <dig> red/white phenotype. to test the rest of the family members, only the affected exon should be amplified and inserted into preal to detect the presence or absence of the psc. the more complex step in this algorithm is the ligation of the pcr product into preal because it involves incubation with restriction enzymes and purification of the cleaved insert. some strategies for directional in frame ligation have been developed by commercial companies . in addition, mrna could be used as template, allowing the amplification by rt-pcr of consecutive exons and therefore reducing the cleavage/ligation steps. however, one of the disadvantages of the rna-based approaches is the requirement for abundantly expressed and stable transcripts. in particular, mrnas carrying pscs are degraded by a specific mechanism that prevents the translation of truncated proteins <cit> . hence, the amount of mrna carrying pscs is highly reduced. therefore, mrna might not be a recommendable starting material for routine diagnosis. another predicted problem with the preal strategy is the possibility that the three-dimensional structure of the polypeptide chain linking the adenylate cyclase fragments may interfere with the functional interaction between the domains yielding an inactive enzyme. this false positive result would be easily detected because white colonies will be observed with control wild type inserts. if this problem is detected for an exon of a gene, western blot analysis should be required to test the presence of full-length protein in the colonies. alternatively, a different mutation detection system should be used for this exon. all in all, adenylate cyclase activity was detected with the three different linkers tested in the present report . in conclusion, before using for clinical diagnosis, this method should be tested for each exon of the gene of interest in control and ptc containing samples. moreover, the accuracy and efficiency of the system to detect ptcs should be confirmed by future prospective studies. CONCLUSIONS the preal plasmid is applicable for the detection of pscs in human genes related to different diseases and is resistant to translation re-initiation events. the diagnosis steps are easy and have a low cost. they require only a laboratory equipped for dna extraction, pcr amplification, ligation, and bacterial culture. the most relevant biological advantages of the method are the detection of only pathologic mutations, thus avoiding subsequent analysis for possible polymorphisms, and the analysis of separated alleles in heterozygous patients. for human genes with a high frequency of pscs, this tool can be applied as a first screening method in an exon by exon strategy. in developing countries, where present methods of molecular diagnoses of hereditary cancers are still expensive and unaffordable for many families, this mutation detection system may become a useful and applicable tool.",

    "prompt": "Outline the prominent clinical observations in a short summary. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND translocation of proteins, from the bulk of the cytosol to the plasma membrane, is a critical step in the transfer of information from membrane-embedded receptors to the cell interior. just to cite a few examples, both rtks and gpcrs recruit, upon activation, effector proteins such as sh2-containing adaptor proteins <cit> , various enzymes and the desensitizing proteins arrestins <cit> . in addition, other classes of effector proteins, such as those of the broad protein kinase c family <cit> , are activated upon translocation to the plasma-membrane microenvironment, independently of receptor binding. detailed knowledge of the translocation of specific proteins, not only in physiological, but also in pathological conditions, may therefore highlight key aspects of defined signalling pathways. impaired or excessive translocations of specific proteins are known in fact to play important roles in the pathogenesis of diseases . in the past, the classical approaches employed to investigate translocation were immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation followed by western blotting of the isolated fractions. although adequate to reveal the existence of the process these approaches suffered of many drawbacks and limitations: possible artefacts, low time and space resolution, low sensitivity, problems in the precise identification of the cellular structures involved, that have limited their use to the low-throughput investigation. the introduction of gfp fluorescent probes and, more recently, of the restoration of the β-galactosidase activity following complementation of two inactive fragments of the enzyme <cit> , has made possible the kinetics of protein translocation to be investigated in living cells. however, with gfp probes the increases in fluorescence are relatively small, often mixed up by the interference of endogenous fluorophores. the novel β-galactosidase complementation procedure is intrinsically complex. two chimeric reporters, the translocating protein and its specific target, localized in a precise subcellular structure, are necessary. the translocation process is inevitably influenced by the binding of the two fragments and the proteins addressed to unknown targets cannot be investigated, limiting this technique for a screening purpose. here we have employed a new procedure based on the use of chimeric constructs where the translocation protein is included in frame with aequorin, a well known bioluminescent photoprotein, per se a ca2+ probe , used so far primarily for the study of ca2+ homeostasis <cit> . the translocation of the aequorin-containing chimera to the sub-plasmalemma rim is able in itself to detect such signal because of the much higher generated locally upon cell stimulation . given the strength of the light signal emitted by aequorin upon ca2+ binding , and the lack of bioluminescent molecules within mammalian cells, the procedure has an excellent signal-to-noise ratio. here we report results obtained by following the translocation of two interesting proteins : β-arrestin- <dig> , addressed to a precise receptor target; and pkcβii, for which no protein target is known in the plasma membrane. by the use of a robot the procedure could be made more powerful, providing information about specific aspects of the translocation process, including its time-course and the dose-dependence of its activation. RESULTS generation of chimeric probes cohesive cdna constructs, encoding aequorin and β-arrestin- <dig> or pkcβ were fused in frame and the reporter chimeric proteins are denominated βarr2-aeq and pkcβ-aeq , respectively. the initial experiments were carried out to establish, using the classical approaches, i.e. immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation followed by western blot of the fractions , whether the aequorin tag does affect or not the activity-dependent translocation of the two proteins investigated, βarr <dig> and pkcβii, after agonists or pharmacological stimulations. the cells used for the studies were hela, that do express only very low levels of endogenous β-adrenergic receptor . the βarr2-aeq cdna was therefore co-transfected transiently with either the β2ar <cit> or an empty vector, and the distribution of βarr2-aeq probe was established before and after stimulation with the receptor agonist, isoprenaline . in resting cells βarr2-aeq exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution ; upon isoprenaline addition the chimera was rapidly translocated to the periphery, however only in the cells transfected with the β2ar . the stimulation time chosen for the luminescence assays with this chimera was therefore of <dig> min. other batches of hela cells were transfected with the pkcβii-aeq cdna and treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , a potent activator of classical pkcs <cit> . in this case, the translocation of the probe, from its diffuse distribution at rest to a peripheral distribution, required less than <dig> min of pma treatment . these times match those reported previously for the translocations of the two proteins upon the two types of stimulation. thus, the aequorin tag does not affect the activity-dependent translocation of either investigated protein. analysis of βarr2-aeq and pkc-aeq translocation by luminescence assay to confirm the validity of the aequorin chemiluminescence procedure to reveal the differential distribution of a protein in the subplasmalemma rim and the cytosol, hela cells were seeded onto <dig> mm coverslips and transiently transfected with two chimeric aequorin cdnas, one encoding a constitutively cytosolic probe <cit> , the other a probe addressed to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane <cit> . thirty six hr after transfection, the probes were reconstituted adding <dig> mm coelenterazine in krebs-ringer modified buffer and the coverslips were transferred to the chamber of a single-well luminometer. with both the cyt-aeq and snap-aeq probes the traces recorded in ca2+-free buffer were slightly above background . upon re-addition of <dig> mm cacl <dig> , the rapid ca2+ influx caused an increase in light emission. as expected, such an increase was over 10-fold greater in the cells expressing the snap-aeq than in those expressing the cyt-aeq probe . indeed, given the steep ca2+ response curve, significant light emission is detected only when the aequorin pool is exposed to high . accordingly, the probe for bulk cytosolic shows a very small light emission upon the large ca2+ rise following ca2+ readdition to cell maintained in ca2+-free media . figures 3a and 3b illustrate also the results obtained with the cells co-transfected with the βarr2-aeq and β2ar cdnas, treated or not with isoprenaline for <dig> min prior to ca2+ re-addition. in the untreated cells the increase of light emission upon ca2+ re-addition was only slightly higher than that observed in the cells transfected with cyt-aeq , whereas in those treated with the β2ar agonist it was much higher, almost as high as that observed with the plasma membrane addressed snap-aeq probe . similar results were obtained in the cells transfected with the pkcβii-aeq cdna and then tested according to the same protocol, with the exception that the pkc stimulant, pma , was administered for <dig> min before ca2+ re-addition . also in this case the emission peak of the stimulated cells was nearly 10-fold higher than that of resting cells, reaching levels analogous to those of the snap-aeq-transfected cells . automatization assay the power of the approach was further investigated by carrying out automated tracing assays in a luminescence plate reader, using 24-well plates governed by a robot. figure <dig> illustrates results obtained in βarr2-aeq/β2ar cdnas expressing hela cells stimulated with isoprenaline . at first, we verified whether in this experimental setup, in which luminescence is not recorded in the injection phase and thus the upstroke of the rise is lost, a reproducible difference in aequorin light emission can be recorded when the βarr2-aeq chimera translocates to the plasma membrane. figures 4a and 4b show that this is indeed the case. the recording of the aequorin peaks elicited by ca2+ re-addition to krb in each of the multi-well plates was in fact much higher in the treated cells than in the controls. additional parameters were investigated. figure 4c shows the time-course of the βarr2-aeq translocation to the plasma membrane upon agonist addition. the maximal response, observed after approx. <dig> s of stimulation, was followed by a persistent plateau. the concentration dependence of the isoprenaline-induced translocation of βarr2-aeq is illustrated in figure 4d. detectable increases were observed at concentrations as low as 10- <dig> m and maximal responses at 10- <dig> m. interestingly, this concentration response curve matches closely the curve of βarr <dig> binding to the β2ar reported previously in clc <dig> cells using the β-galactosidase complementation procedure <cit> . discussion the possibility of randomly developing thousands of new drugs by combinatorial chemistry, and to rapidly develop lead compounds, represents an immense value in pharmaceutical research. to take full advantage of this technological potential, however, screening methodologies must be available that are robust, reproducible and amenable to medium/high throughput applications. in some cases , the tools commonly employed in basic research, the intracellularly trappable fluorescent dyes, such as fura- <dig> or fluo- <dig> proved highly effective in high-throughput screenings, and are commonly employed for the development of the vast array of drugs acting on ca2+ signalling <cit> . these probes, however, can monitor one of the earliest events following receptor activation, but the data thus obtained are difficult to interpret for the understanding of other downstream signalling processes: protein translocation to the plasma-membrane is a typical example: it is a signalling step common to many diverse pathways <cit> , but the currently available probes and techniques do not allow wide-range screenings or require complex and error-prone data analyses. in this contribution, we have developed a novel approach that utilizes a ca2+ sensitive photoprotein, aequorin, for a task different from the measurement of calcium signalling itself, and stems from an experimental observation and a technical aspect. the first is the measurement of the in the thin rim of cytoplasm beneath the plasma membrane, where both at rest and in particular upon stimulation the flow of ca2+ from the extracellular medium produces a local that is at least one order of magnitude higher than in the deeper, bulk cytosol <cit> . thus, aequorin can act as a tag of protein translocation, as the simple movement of the tagged protein to the plasma membrane markedly changes the to which it is exposed. the second startpoint of the new methodology is an intrinsic property of the photoprotein, i.e. the logarithmic correlation between and light emission <cit> . this property, that greatly increases light output with relatively small increases, represents in most cases an experimental concern, as it tends to amplify the contribution of highly responding cells or cell domains in signalling studies. in the case of the new methodology reported in this paper, the high reponsiveness of the photoprotein represents a major plus, as it allows to detect protein translocation also when only a fraction of the protein actually moves within the cell. together with the other advantages of a luminescence-based probe , this property provides a striking advantage over existing methodologies . we have thus developed aequorin-based probes, that allow to detect the translocation of two classes of signalling proteins, a receptor adapter <cit> and an important enzyme transducer, a member of the broad and complex family of pkc <cit> . the engineered probes, βarr2-aeq and pkcβ-aeq were uniformly distributed in the cytosol at rest, and translocated to the plasma membrane upon stimulation with suitable compounds , triggering a dramatic increase in aequorin photon emission. in both cases, the probes proved very effective also with automated multi-well detectors. for β-arrestin, the pharmacological characterization of a receptor agonist proved its reliability, not only in the identification of active compounds, but also in the complete assessment of its functional properties. CONCLUSIONS overall, the understanding of the subcellular heterogeneity of ca2+ homeostasis and the experience with a recombinant luminescent ca2+ probe has allowed us to develop a robust, highly reproducible methodology for monitoring, in research applications and screening platforms, the translocation of specific proteins to the plasma membrane. this innovation will allow deciphering, and pharmacologically tackling, a critical step in a wide variety of signalling pathways including the whole complement of gpcrs and rtks and kinases recruited to the plasma membrane independently of receptor activation <cit> . this cellular assay, based on a single reporter protein and the unique single-to-noise ratio of the luminescent probe, meets the expanding demand for cost-effective screening procedures. it may therefore prove a highly valuable tool for identifying new blockbuster drugs in compound libraries of thousands of chemicals.",

    "prompt": "Write a short summary of the patient's vital signs and labs. ### Text to summarize: BACKGROUND land plants uptake carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and lose water vapour by transpiration through stomatal pores, present on the surface of leaves and stems. the opening and closure of the pore is mediated by turgor-driven volume changes of two surrounding guard cells, whose pressure is dynamically adjusted according to environmental and hormonal cues. in response to abiotic stresses, such as drought or high salinity, one of the most rapid responses of plants is the closure of stomata, mediated by the hormone abscisic acid , to prevent excessive water loss by transpiration . the genetic manipulation of stomatal activity is emerging as a promising approach to reduce the water requirement of crops, and to enhance productivity under stress conditions <cit> . proper engineering of stomatal responses requires the use of guard cell-specific promoters, or the identification of guard cell-specific mutants, to avoid undesirable side effects on plant growth and productivity. several promoters that confer guard cell-specific gene expression or enhanced gene expression in guard cells have been isolated through different methods: functional characterization of single genes <cit> ; large scale gene- or enhancer-trap screens <cit> . moreover transcriptomic and proteomic studies have identified additional candidates <cit> . nevertheless the majority of these promoters are not guard cell-specific, as they drive the expression of reporter genes in other cell types, including the vascular tissues <cit> , flower organs <cit> or starch containing cells <cit> , significantly reducing the number of true guard cell-specific full size promoters <cit> . most importantly, a detailed experimental analysis of guard cell-specific promoters has been performed only in very few cases <cit> . a true guard cell-specific promoter is driving expression of the arabidopsis atmyb <dig> gene <cit> . we have previously shown that atmyb <dig> is expressed in guard cells <cit> , and the complete 5' and 3' intergenic genomic regions of this gene, cloned respectively upstream and downstream to reporter genes, were able to drive specific expression in guard cells <cit> . guard cell specificity of the atmyb <dig> promoter has been also demonstrated by nagy et al. and by meyer et al , who used this promoter to complement the mrp5- <dig> mutant phenotype exclusively in guard cells, and to specifically express the atlmt <dig> protein at high levels in guard cells, respectively. very little information is available concerning promoter cis-elements regulating guard cell-specific expression <cit> . dof-binding sites have been suggested to have a role in such a regulation <cit> . dof proteins are plant specific transcription factors involved in light, phytohormones and pathogen signalling and responses as well as seed development . a role for aaag dof-binding sites in mediating gene expression in guard cells has been experimentally defined only for the potato kst <dig> gene <cit> . however, in arabidopsis the role of dof-motifs in controlling guard cell expression is still controversial <cit> . the study performed on the potato kst <dig> promoter <cit> and the bioinformatic analysis performed on several guard-cell specific arabidopsis promoters <cit> suggest that the presence of clusters of dof cis-elements, rather than their absolute number, is important to confer guard cell-specificity to a promoter region <cit> . yet, the role of dof-binding sites in driving guard cell expression in arabidopsis and the hypothesis of cluster organization remains to be experimentally investigated. the guard-cell specific atmyb <dig> promoter presents several dof clusters, making it an ideal model to test the hypothesis that dof clusters are important for guard cell-specific expression. moreover the atmyb <dig> expression is modulated by different environmental cues such as light, dark and drought stress <cit> , suggesting the presence of different cis-elements controlling these transcriptional responses. in this report we aimed to isolate the cis-elements responsible for the atmyb <dig> guard cell specific expression. we generated arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying truncated or mutagenised atmyb <dig> promoter versions fused to the gus reporter gene. using a combination of histochemical and expression analysis we were able to identify a minimal promoter necessary and sufficient to drive guard cell specific expression. using the same tools, we were also able to map a region required for aba-mediated repression. RESULTS in-silico analysis of the atmyb <dig> promoter in a previous study, we demonstrated that the complete 5' and 3' atmyb <dig> intergenic genomic regions - cloned upstream and downstream of the β-glucoronidase reporter gene, respectively - could specifically drive strong gus activity in stomata of arabidopsis seedlings and adult plants <cit> . no gus signals were detected in any other cell type or in tissues devoid of stomata <cit> . to investigate the possible cis-acting elements that regulate atmyb <dig> expression, we surveyed the genomic region upstream of the atmyb <dig> translational start codon for the presence of known transcription factor binding sites using the place software <cit> . our analysis produced a significant enrichment in the aaag motifs in the atmyb <dig> promoter compared to the average distribution of aaag oligos in intergenic regions throughout the arabidopsis genome . interestingly, these aaag motifs, have been shown to be involved in the regulation of guard cell expression of the potato potassium channel kst <dig> gene <cit> . also, clusters of aaag motifs, required for the binding of dof-type transcription factors <cit> , were over represented in different guard cells-specific promoters <cit> . in particular, galbiati and colleagues suggested, as guard cell-specific cis-element, a cluster of at least three aaag motifs located on the same strand within a region of <dig> bp <cit> . using the criteria previously described by galbiati and collaborators , we found three of these guard cell-specific clusters in the 5' intergenic region of the atmyb <dig> gene , suggesting a conserved mechanism for guard cell specific expression. identification of the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter to gain more insights into the cis-elements that regulate the atmyb <dig> expression in guard cells, we produced a set of arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying the complete <dig> bp 5' intergenic region upstream of the translational start codon fused to the reporter gus . gus staining analysis of <dig> independent t <dig> lines revealed that this region contains all the cis-acting elements required for expression of the reporter in stomata , while no gus signals were detected in any other cell type or in tissues devoid of stomata . next, we made a series of 5' deletions of the - <dig> bp genomic region to define the minimum sequence length required for the expression in guard cells . these truncated promoters were stably transferred to arabidopsis and <dig> to <dig> independent t <dig> transgenic lines were analysed in detail. deletions of the distal part of the <dig> bp region to position - <dig> , - <dig> , or - <dig> from the atg codon, did not alter expression of the reporter in guard cells located on both vegetative and floral organs . further deletions indicated that the <dig> bp proximal region was sufficient to drive expression of the reporter in stomata . however, the removal of the region between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp completely abolished gus activity in guard cell . transgenic lines carrying the -205::gus fusion did not show gus staining in any other cell type, even after prolonged staining . this finding suggests that the <dig> bp region located between positions - <dig> and - <dig> contains cis-elements essential for expression in stomatal guard cells. based on these results, we defined the - <dig> bp region upstream of the atg codon as the minimal promoter of the atmyb <dig> gene. to thoroughly investigate quantitative differences in gus expression among lines carrying different deletion:reporter constructs, we determined the relative amount of gus transcript by quantitative rt-pcr . mrna samples derived from two representative independent lines were analysed for each construct . lines harbouring the <dig> bp 5' intergenic region or the - <dig> deletion fused to the reporter, did not show any significant differences in their gus transcript accumulation. conversely, deletions to position - <dig> and - <dig> resulted in a two-fold decrease in gus expression compared to the - <dig> ::gus line, while deletion to position - <dig> resulted in a five-fold decrease . these results indicate that one or more sequences with function of enhancer are present in the genomic region between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp and between - <dig> and - <dig> from the atg of atmyb <dig> in accordance with the results obtained from the histochemical analysis, qrt-pcr experiments did not detect significant gus transcripts accumulation in lines carrying the -205::gus fusion. site-directed mutagenesis of the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter promoter deletion experiments indicate that the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter region contains all the cis-acting elements required to sustain expression of a reporter gene in guard cells. this region encompasses the aaag cluster proximal to the atg codon, which consists of four aaaag dof-binding sites . in addition, the place software identified in this region a single w-box, corresponding to the binding site of wrky transcription factors <cit> , located upstream of the aaag cluster . to address the functional significance of the individual cis-elements present in the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter, we evaluated the effects of targeted nucleotide substitutions on gus expression . mutated versions of the minimal promoter were generated by pcr and fused to gus and at least <dig> t <dig> independent transgenic lines for each mutated promoter::gus combination were visually scored and classified to reflect their relative guard-cell specific gus staining. a representative example of each category is provided in figure 3c. we initially tested the role of the single w-box cis-element, by replacing the consensus sequence ttgac, with the non-functional ttgaa motif <cit> . lines carrying the mutated w-box showed similar levels of gus expression to the wild-type promoter, indicating that w-box does not contribute to mediate gene expression in guard cells . next, we produced mutant promoters in which single dof motifs within the aaag cluster were converted to the unrelated cgcga sequence. inactivation of the most distal aaaag site relative to the atg resulted in a dramatic decrease of gus expression . 30% of the lines carrying the mdof1::gus construct did not show gus expression, whereas the remaining 70% only showed weak staining, thus indicating a crucial role for dof <dig> in regulating atmyb <dig> expression in guard cells . mutations of the second, third or fourth most proximal aaaag site , resulted in a reduced gus expression, although to a lesser extent than the one in the dof <dig> . in particular, none of the <dig> mdof2::gus transgenic lines displayed strong expression of the reporter, nearly 70% showed intermediate expression, 25% showed weak expression and the remaining 5% did not show any gus staining . a comparable distribution among strong, intermediate and weak lines was obtained from the analysis of the mdof3::gus and mdof4::gus plants . to establish whether dof-binding sites could exert additive roles in mediating gene expression in stomata we produced a second series of promoters, in which two aaaag motifs were mutated simultaneously. mutations of dof <dig> and dof <dig> ::gus), dof <dig> and dof <dig> ::gus) or dof <dig> and dof <dig> ::gus) completely inactivated the minimal promoter, as gus expression was abolished in all the mdof::gus, mdof::gus and mdof::gus lines analysed . interestingly, the concurrent mutation of dof <dig> and dof <dig> ::gus) resulted in a strong, but yet not complete, inactivation of the promoter activity in guard cells, as 15% of the mdof::gus lines displayed weak expression of the reporter in stomata. likewise, concomitant inactivation of either dof <dig> and dof <dig> or dof <dig> and dof <dig> did not completely eliminate gus expression in guard cell . taken together, these results indicate that the putative aaag dof-binding sites located in the atmyb <dig> promoter are necessary to mediate its expression in guard cells. a single dof cluster is sufficient to drive low expression in guard cell our deletion analysis of the atmyb <dig> promoter indicates that the <dig> bp region between positions - <dig> and - <dig> is essential for gene expression in stomatal guard cells . this region contains the dof <dig> cis-element required for guard cell expression as shown by mutagenesis analysis results . to establish whether this <dig> bp region was sufficient to activate expression in guard cells, we fused one , two and four tandem copies of the <dig> bp fragment to the minimal camv35s promoter <cit> upstream of the gus reporter gene , effectively reconstructing an artificial dof cluster containing one, two or four copies of the dof <dig> element. however, we did not observe gus activity in any of the <dig> independent stable transformants produced for each construct, even after prolonged staining . these data were confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis of independent lines carrying the 4x::gus fusion , indicating that the multimerisation of the dof <dig> site per se is not sufficient to drive gene expression in guard cell. this might derive from an inappropriate organization and/or spatial distribution of the different dof elements in the context of the minimal promoter. to test this hypothesis we made two 3' deletions of the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter: the -148-3'::gus and -137-3'::gus constructs containing the first three and four dof-binding sites respectively of the most proximal cluster fused upstream of the minimal camv35s promoter . our initial histochemical analysis did not reveal any gus positive lines . to substantiate this result we also performed a qrt-pcr analysis on fifteen independent lines for each construct. interestingly, eight lines out of fifteen showed a low but significant gus transcript accumulation compared to the full length minimal promoter . these results suggest that the presence of the cluster containing three or four dof-binding sites is sufficient to drive gus activity in guard cells, even though at a very low level. this finding implies that other cis-elements present downstream of position - <dig> are required for the full functionality of the minimal promoter. the guard cell-related cdf <dig> cdf <dig> cdf <dig> and cdf <dig> dof-type transcription factors do not regulate atmyb <dig> expression in stomata target mutagenesis experiments of the atmyb <dig> promoter demonstrated that aaag dna consensus motifs are essential cis-acting elements in the regulation of atmyb <dig> expression in guard cells. consequently, their cognate dof proteins represent the most likely candidates as trans-acting factors. as the arabidopsis genome contains <dig> dof-coding genes <cit> , candidate dof transcription factors involved in the regulation of atmyb <dig> expression should fulfil two criteria: they should be expressed in guard cells and the loss of their gene function should abolish or significantly down-regulate the expression of atmyb <dig> in this cell type. the cycling dof factor <dig> gene, involved in the regulation of photoperiodic flowering, has been shown to be highly expressed in the vascular tissue and guard cells <cit> . we thus investigated the expression of the atmyb <dig> gene in the loss-of-function cdf1-r allele. as shown in additional file <dig> we did not detect significant differences in the accumulation of atmyb <dig> transcripts in homozygous cdf1-r plants compared with the wild type. it is important to note that in photoperiodic flowering, cdf <dig> acts redundantly with three other dof proteins, namely cdf <dig> , cdf <dig> and cdf <dig> <cit> , belonging to the same phylogenetic group ii <cit> . similarly to cdf <dig> promoter::gus analyses revealed that cdf <dig> cdf <dig> and cdf <dig> are strongly expressed in guard cells. we thus analysed the expression of atmyb <dig> in single, double, triple and quadruple cdf mutants to determine the possible role of these additional candidate cdf proteins. as for cdf1-r mutant, the level of expression of atmyb <dig> was not significantly reduced in the cdf2- <dig> cdf3- <dig> and cdf5- <dig> single mutants . likewise, atmyb <dig> expression was not altered in any of the double, triple or quadruple mutant combinations, indicating that, despite their expression in guard cells, these four cdf proteins are not trans-regulators of atmyb <dig> expression in stomata . identification of a promoter region that negatively responds to aba we previously reported that transcript accumulation of the atmyb <dig> gene is rapidly down-regulated by exogenous applications of the hormone aba, which plays a fundamental role in regulating gene expression in response to drought stress <cit> . to identify the promoter region responsible for the aba-mediated atmyb <dig> down-regulation, we applied aba to the previously described transgenic lines harbouring serial deletions of the atmyb <dig> promoter . quantitative rt-pcr analysis revealed a similar decrease in gus transcript levels in transgenic lines carrying the full length as well as the - <dig> - <dig> and -366::gus fusions . the kinetic of down-regulation of the gus transcript was comparable to the one observed for the endogenous gene atmyb <dig> <cit> , indicating that - <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> promoters maintain the sequences responsible for transcriptional down-regulation by aba. also, these results suggest that the caagttg motif, present in the atmyb <dig> promoter between - <dig> and - <dig> , and recently described as overrepresented in aba-repressed genes <cit> , does not play a significant role in the aba-dependent repression of atmyb <dig> expression. rather, qrt-pcr experiments performed on different independent lines carrying the -246::gus construct showed that the minimal promoter sequence lacks the region responsible for negative regulation by aba, as these lines did not show changes in gus expression in response to the hormone as shown in figure <dig> taken together these data indicate that, although the minimal promoter maintains the cis-elements necessary for guard cell expression, it lacks the motifs that mediate the negative regulation by aba, becoming aba-insensitive. we can thus conclude that the region between - <dig> and - <dig> contains elements necessary for aba down-regulation. discussion very few guard cell-specific promoters have been described to date <cit> . independent studies demonstrated that the atmyb <dig> promoter can be considered guard cell-specific, being sufficient to drive expression of reporter genes specifically in guard cells <cit> . moreover this promoter has also been used to complement a mutant phenotype specifically in guard cells <cit> , and to investigate subcellular localization exclusively in guard cells <cit> . in this study we identified the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter that is necessary and sufficient to drive guard cell-specific expression. dof-binding sites are required for atmyb <dig> guard-cells expression our in silico analysis identified three dof site clusters . initial deletion studies revealed a prominent role for the most proximal dof cluster . site-directed mutagenesis showed that the distal most dof-binding site plays a major role in driving guard cell expression compared to other dof motifs of the same cluster . these other dof elements play partially additive roles, as clearly demonstrated by the combined mutagenesis of these sites and dof <dig> site which resulted in a drastically reduced gus activity . dof-binding sites are thus key determinants in mediating guard cell expression, in accordance with the dof cluster hypothesis we previously formulated <cit> . a suggestion for a similar involvement of dof cis-elements in arabidopsis derives from the work of gardner and colleagues that identified dof motifs in a region controlling guard cell expression. other authors identified a region enriched in dof-binding sites in the guard cell-specific pgc <dig> promoter, although the mutation of a single dof site did not impair promoter activity <cit> . interestingly, a dof cluster organization is present in the promoter of the grape vvmyb <dig> gene, a putative ortholog of atmyb <dig> indicating a conservation of the cluster structure during the evolution among atmyb <dig> orthologs <cit> . the results reported by plesch and colleagues on the dof motif organisation in the potato kst <dig> promoter highlight a more general evolutionary conservation of this module in the control of guard cell-specific activity of promoters. although we cannot rule out the possibility that other unknown transcription factors might interact with those same cis-elements, dof factors represent likely candidates as atmyb <dig> regulators. the most parsimonious hypothesis resulting from combining our results indicates that dof proteins act as positive regulators of atmyb <dig> the potato stdof <dig> protein has been shown to bind in vitro to the guard cell specific promoter of kst <dig> <cit> , while no data are available for any arabidopsis dof proteins. among the arabidopsis dof genes, cdf <dig> cdf <dig> cdf <dig> and cdf <dig> are expressed in guard cells <cit> . however, singles and multiple cdf mutants show a wild-type pattern of atmyb <dig> expression, ruling out their involvement in atmyb <dig> regulation . the majority of arabidopsis dof genes are expressed in guard cells <cit> and may thus act redundantly, as already demonstrated among members of this family <cit> . all these aspects do not facilitate the identification of obvious candidates as atmyb <dig> regulators. we are trying to identify the dof genes involved in the regulation of atmyb <dig> by analysis of its expression in mutants of genes preferentially expressed in the guard cells . multiple cis-elements participate to enhance atmyb <dig> guard-cells expression transcriptional gus fusions, harbouring different deletions of the 5' intergenic region to position - <dig> from the atg, conferred gus activity exclusively in guard cells . the activity of these promoter regions is in apparent discrepancy with the detection of atmyb <dig> gene expression in seeds, as revealed by available microarray analysis data <cit> and in roots, as recently reported <cit> . one hypothesis to explain this incongruity could be the presence of other regulatory regions present outside the complete 5' and 3' intergenic regions flanking the atmyb <dig> coding sequence. intron sequences, for example, may be involved in such a regulation, as previously demonstrated for different plant genes . while guard-cell specific expression was invariably maintained by functional atmyb <dig> promoter variants, the levels of expression varied considerably. in addition to dof-binding sites, other cis-elements are required to boost the atmyb <dig> expression. indeed, an artificial dof <dig> binding site repeated in single or multiple copies could not drive guard cell expression . the incorporation of the entire proximal dof cluster resulted in a small but significant guard cell transcriptional activity. thus, other cis-elements downstream of position - <dig> are required for full activity of the minimal promoter. it is known that cis-elements other than dof-binding sites are involved in the regulation of guard cell expression. in the case of the guard cell-specific atpdr <dig> gene no aaag clusters were identified in a 1000-bp region upstream of the atg codon, suggesting the presence of other regulatory units <cit> . modular organization of the atmyb <dig> promoter in this study we also investigated the regulation of the atmyb <dig> promoter activity in response to aba. aba treatments induce global changes in gene expression in arabidopsis <cit> . transcriptomic analyses revealed extensive regulation of gene expression by aba also in guard cells <cit> . while cis-elements that positively regulate the response to aba have been functionally characterised , those that negatively regulate the response to aba are largely unknown. a caattg motif has been shown to be over-represented in aba-repressed gene promoters and thus proposed for such a role <cit> . the atmyb <dig> promoter contains one caagttg motif between - <dig> and - <dig> from the atg, yet our results do not support its proposed role as negative regulator of aba response. conversely, a region between positions - <dig> to - <dig> contained the entire requirement for the aba-mediated repression figures <dig> and <dig> it has been proposed that evolution may have favoured the differentiation of mechanisms for aba down-regulation rather than up-regulation, rendering more difficult for any aba-repression motif to achieve statistical significance <cit> . our data may provide a valuable model system to clarify the mechanism mediating aba repression. our data suggests a modular organization for the atmyb <dig> promoter as summarised in figure <dig> through a serial deletion analysis, we defined the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter, sufficient to induce guard cell-specific activity . a <dig> bp region, located between position - <dig> and position - <dig> is necessary to confer gus activity in guard cells . we also identified two regions that enhance the expression of the gus gene between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp and between - <dig> and - <dig> . besides providing pieces of evidence for such modular organization, our work indicates that the different portions of the atmyb <dig> promoter may prove useful for manipulating gene expression in guard cells, with the possibility to obtain different level of expression. moreover, the minimal promoter can be used for aba-independent expression of target genes in guard cells interestingly, both the full length and the minimal promoters maintain their guard cell-specific activity in heterologous systems, such as the crop species tomato and tobacco , thus indicating the conservation of this cell-specific regulatory mechanism among different plant species. moreover, preliminary results suggest that the atmyb <dig> minimal promoter can be combined with other cis-regulatory modules to produce functional guard cell-specific chimeric promoters . as a whole our data demonstrate that both the full length and the minimal atmyb <dig> promoters provide a valuable tool to manipulate gene expression specifically in guard cells, both for physiological studies and downstream biotechnological applications. CONCLUSIONS our work provides strong evidence for the involvement of aaag elements in the regulation of the atmyb <dig> expression, illustrating their functional cluster organization. future work will concentrate on the analysis of candidate dof transcription factors that control this mechanism. finally we identify a region of the atmyb <dig> promoter required for the negative regulation by aba, offering the possibility to discover novel cis-elements for this kind of regulation.",

Resection of dartos tissue usually makes the penis straight in patients with hypospadias and corrects it in those with buried penis, suggesting a common pathophysiology related to dartos tissue. Tissue samples from 113 children undergoing primary penile surgery for hypospadias (94 patients), epispadias (1) or buried penis (18) were collected between November 2011 and September 2013. Tissue samples from 79 children undergoing circumcision for nonmedical reasons served as controls. All samples were stained with smooth muscle actin and analyzed by the same pathologist, who was blinded to indication for surgery. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were applied. Three different dartos tissue patterns were observed. Pattern I (normal) consisted of smooth muscle fibers of dartos tissue organized in a parallel configuration in the subcutaneous tissue. Pattern II was characterized by poorly developed and hypotrophic smooth muscle fibers. Pattern III was determined by randomly distributed smooth muscle fibers in the subcutaneous tissue, without parallel configuration. Pattern I was observed in 45 circumcision specimens (64%). Of buried penis cases 78% were considered abnormal (pattern II in 4 cases and III in 10, p = 0.001). Of hypospadias cases 70% were considered abnormal (pattern II in 31 cases, III in 32, and mixed II and III in 3, p < 0.001). The only epispadias case was designated pattern II.",

Subclinical changes in left ventricular (LV) function can be identified using quantification of myocardial strain, and global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a superior predictor of outcomes than ejection fraction. We hypothesized that increased OPG levels could predict subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in treated diabetic hypertensive patients with preserved LV ejection fraction. The study was composed of 86 diabetic hypertensive and 30 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. All patients underwent echocardiography and venous blood samples were taken for determination of OPG. The relation between OPG levels and LV GLS was investigated using 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Diabetic hypertensive patients had higher diastolic peak early/early diastolic tissue velocity and lower systolic tissue velocity, GLS, GLS rate systolic, and GLS rate early diastolic than nondiabetic hypertensive patients (P = 0.009, P = 0.049, P < 0.001, P = 0.004, and P < 0.001, respectively). Diabetic hypertensive patients were divided into 2 groups according to median GLS value (> 18.5 and ≤ 18.5). The patients with GLS ≤ 18.5 had higher diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; P = 0.048), OPG (pmol/L; P < 0.001), and hemoglobin A1c (%; P = 0.042) values than those with GLS > 18.5. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, OPG was found to be an independent predictor of impaired GLS (P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that OPG values of > 6.45 (pmol/L) identified the patients with GLS ≤ 18.5.",

Women, 15 to 45 years of age, who sought EC or pregnancy testing from an urban family planning clinic completed surveys at the time of their clinic visit (August 22, 2011, to May 30, 2013) and 3 months after their clinic visit. The surveys assessed contraceptive use and symptoms, testing, and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and PID. We reviewed the medical records of participants who reported IUD placement within 3 months of enrollment and abstracted de-identified electronic medical record (EMR) data on all women who sought EC or pregnancy testing from the study clinic during the study period. During the study period, 1,060 women visited the study clinic; 272 completed both enrollment and follow-up surveys. Among survey completers with same-day IUD placement, PID in the 3 months after enrollment was not more common (1/28 [3.6%]; 95% CI, 0%-10.4%) than among women who did not have a same-day IUD placed (11/225 [4.9%]; 95% CI, 2.7%-8.6%; p = .71).

Wound healing is an inherent process, but the aberrant wound healing of skin injury may lead to HS. There has been growing evidence suggesting a role for TGF-β1 and Ski in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. The MTT assay was used to detect the cell proliferation induced by TGF-β1. The Ski gene was transduced into cells with an adenovirus, and then the function of Ski in cell proliferation and differentiation was observed. Ski mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of α-SMA, E-cadherin, Meox1, Meox2, Zeb1 and Zeb2. TGF-β1 can promote human skin fibroblast (HSF) cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner, but the promoting effect could be suppressed by Ski. TGF-β1 also induces the formation of the myofibroblast phenotype and the effect of TGF-β1 could be diminished by Ski. Also, Ski modulates the cardiac myofibroblast phenotype and function through suppression of Zeb2 by up-regulating the expression of Meox2.",

They are also the source of reactive oxygen species that cause damage to the biochemical components of the cell and lead to cellular ageing and death. Under winemaking conditions, Saccharomyces yeasts exclusively have a fermentative metabolism due to the high sugar content of grape must. However, their production as an active dry yeast (ADY) form required aerobic propagation and a dehydration process. In these industrial steps, oxidative stress is particularly harmful for the cell. In this work, we analysed the impact of the mitochondrial genome on oxidative stress response, longevity and dehydration tolerance using the synthetic interspecific hybrids obtained between two S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum strains. The isogenic nature of nuclear DNA of such hybrids allowed us to analyse the impact of mitochondrial DNA for fermentative and oxidative stress conditions. Under grape must conditions, the inheritance of mitochondrial DNA poorly impacted the fermentative performance of interspecific hybrids, unlike the hybrids with S. cerevisiae mitochondrial inheritance, which displayed increased tolerance to oxidative stress and dehydration, and showed an extended chronological longevity when cells were grown with aeration.",

Microbubbles (MB) bearing antibodies targeting lymphocyte CD4 (MBCD4), endothelial P-selectin (MBPSel), or isotype control antibody (MBIso) and MB with a negative electric charge for targeting of leukocytes (MBLc) were prepared. Attachment of MBCD4 was validated in vitro using murine spleen CD4+ T cells. Twenty-eight mice were studied after the induction of autoimmune myocarditis by immunization with α-myosin-peptide; 20 mice served as controls. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound molecular imaging of the heart was performed. Left ventricular function was assessed by conventional and deformation echocardiography, and myocarditis severity graded on histology. Animals were grouped into no myocarditis, moderate myocarditis, and severe myocarditis. In vitro, attachment of MBCD4 to CD4+ T cells was significantly greater than of MBIso. Of the left ventricular ejection fraction or strain and strain rate readouts, only longitudinal strain was significantly different from control animals in severe myocarditis. In contrast, contrast-enhanced ultrasound molecular imaging showed increased signals for all targeted MB versus MBIso both in moderate and severe myocarditis, and MBCD4 signal correlated with CD4+ T-lymphocyte infiltration in the myocardium.",

As hospitalization is the major consumer of healthcare resources, the prognostic power of admission NPs with regard to the duration of hospitalization deserves further investigation. We assessed retrospectively the association between NP values sampled shortly following unplanned admission and the duration of hospitalization in 2978 patients admitted to a cardiology department. Duration of hospitalization (hours) and survival were determined by interrogation of the electronic medical records system. Associations with peptide levels were estimated using regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results demonstrate a significant positive relationship between NP levels and the duration of hospitalization, after adjusting for age (P < 0.001). The median duration of hospitalization for the lowest BNP and NT-proBNP quintiles were 80 and 97 h, respectively, vs. 224.5 and 236 h for the highest quintiles. Using cut-off levels of 115 pmol/L for BNP and 390 pmol/L for NT-proBNP, the peptides have a positive predictive value of 78% and 85% for a stay >4 days.

Therapy with the conventional antidepressant drugs may induce the serious adverse reactions. Moreover, its benefits may be seen at least 2-4 weeks after the first dose. Therefore, the alternative strategies for prevention and treatment of depression are sought. The main aim of our study was to assess the effects of ifenprodil given at a non-active dose (10mg/kg) on the activity of antidepressant agents from diverse pharmacological groups. The antidepressant-like effect was assessed by the forced swim test in mice.

The use of admission troponin-I (TnI) level to identify patients at high risk of delayed AF detection was investigated. Consecutive ischemic stroke and TIA cases presenting to our institute over a 13-month period were identified from the Irish Stroke and TIA Register. Electronic databases and case notes were examined. \"Delayed\" AF was diagnosed after a sinus rhythm admission electrocardiogram and no documented history. Group comparisons were made by AF status. The association between TnI and AF was investigated using a multivariate regression model. A total of 185 cases (130 ischemic stroke) were analyzed. Mean age (standard deviation) was 73.3 (13.9) years, 47% female. Sixty-two cases (33.5%) had AF. The first documented presentation of AF was found in 21 cases, on admission electrocardiogram (n = 11) or inpatient telemetry (delayed, n = 10). TnI was higher in those with delayed AF than in those without AF (W = 194; P = .036). A higher proportion of those with an elevated TnI (30%) than those with a normal TnI (6.1%) had delayed diagnosis of AF (χ(2) = 6.41, P = .011).

The genetic variation in Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), which is also called adiponutrin (ADPN), in residue 148 (I148M, rs738409) has been associated with NAFLD. However, the regulation and function of PNPLA3 in metabolic diseases remains unclear. Laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) of severely obese patients reduces body weight, liver and adipose tissue inflammation. In this study, we investigated whether weight loss induced by LAGB affected PNPLA3 expression in hepatic and adipose tissue. Liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were collected from 28 severely obese patients before and 6 months after LAGB. PNPLA3 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. To understand whether inflammatory stimuli regulated PNPLA3 expression, we studied the effect of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on PNPLA3 expression in human adipocytes and hepatocytes. PNPLA3 was strongly expressed in the liver and clearly detectable in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese patients. Weight loss induced by LAGB of severely obese patients led to significantly increased adipose, but not hepatic, tissue expression of PNPLA3. Subcutaneous PNPLA3 expression negatively correlated with body-mass-index, fasting glucose and fasting insulin. TNFα potently suppressed PNPLA3 expression in adipocytes but not hepatocytes.",

Epidemiological studies revealed association of tobacco smoking with epigenetic changes at single CpGs in blood. However, the biological relevance of the often only marginal methylation changes remains unclear. Comparing genome-wide changes in CpG methylation of three recently reported epidemiological datasets, two obtained on whole blood and one on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), it becomes evident that the majority of methylation changes (86.7 and 93.3 %) in whole blood account for changes in granulocytes. Analyzing, in more detail, seven highly significant reported smoking-induced methylation changes at single CpGs in different blood cell types of healthy volunteers (n = 32), we confirmatively found a strong cell-type specificity. Two CpGs in GFI1 and F2RL3 were significantly hypomethylated in granulocytes (-11.3 %, p = 0.001; -8.7 %, p = 0.001, respectively) but not in PBMCs of smokers while two CpGs in CPOX and GPR15 were found to be hypomethylated in PBMC (-4.3 %, p = 0.003; -4.2 %, P = 0.009, respectively) and their subtypes of GPR15 non-expressing (-3.2 %, p = 0.027; -2.5 %, p = 0.032, respectively) and smoking-evoked GPR15 expressing T cells (-15.8 %, p < 0.001; -13.8 %, p = 0.018, respectively) but not in granulocytes. In contrast, cg05575921 within AHRR was hypomethylated in every analyzed cell type of smokers, but with a different degree. Both, hypomethylation at cg05575921 in granulocytes (-55.2 % methylation change in smokers, p < 0.001) and the frequency of GPR15+ T cells (9.8-37.1 % in smokers), possessing a specific hypomethylation at cg19859270, were strongly associated with smoking behavior at individual level and could therefore serve as valuable biomarkers indicating a disturbed homeostasis in smokers. In contrast to the reported long-term persistent methylation changes in adult smokers after cessation, the hypomethylation at cg05575921 in prenatally tobacco smoke-exposed children (n = 13) from our LINA cohort was less stable and disappeared already within 2 years after birth.",

However, the nature of Siglec-10 and CD24 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still poorly defined. Hereon, the expression, function, and regulation of CD24 and Siglec-10 in HCC were investigated in the present study. Flow cytometry was performed to examine the expression of Siglec-10 in HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues of HCC patients. To further determine whether Siglec-10 expression is associated with the clinical characteristics and survival, conventional immunohistochemistry was performed in 96 HCC patients. Additionally, the role of Siglec-10 in the regulation of natural killer (NK) cell dysfunction was evaluated. Finally, CD24 expression in HCC was also assessed. Siglec-10 was expressed most on NK cells in HCC (40.7 ± 4.5%). Compared with surrounding non-tumor tissues, tumor tissues had higher Siglec-10 expression (31.0 ± 1.7% versus 40.7 ± 4.5%, n = 10, P < 0.05), and the expression was negatively associated with patient survival. Siglec-10(+)CD56(+) NK cells exhibited reduced effector function, as shown by decreased granules and cytokine expressions compared with Siglec-10(-)CD56(+) NK cells. Moreover, the number of CD24(+)CD45(-) cells in HCC tissues was higher than that in adjacent non-tumor tissues (9.4 ± 0.9% versus 3.1 ± 0.9%, n = 15, P < 0.05).",

Consequently, antagonists of CXCR3 are of therapeutic interest. In this study, we set out to characterize binding sites of the specific low MW CXCR3 antagonist VUF10085 and the broad spectrum antagonist TAK-779 which blocks CXCR3 along with CCR2 and CCR5. Molecular modelling of CXCR3, followed by virtual ligand docking, highlighted several CXCR3 residues likely to contact either antagonist, notably a conserved aspartate in helix 2 (Asp-112(2:63) ), which was postulated to interact with the quaternary nitrogen of TAK-779. Validation of modelling was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis of CXCR3, followed by assays of cell surface expression, ligand binding and receptor activation. Mutation of Asn-132(3.33) , Phe-207 and Tyr-271(6.51) within CXCR3 severely impaired both ligand binding and chemotactic responses, suggesting that these residues are critical for maintenance of a functional CXCR3 conformation. Contrary to our hypothesis, mutation of Asp-112(2:63) had no observable effects on TAK-779 activity, but clearly decreased the antagonist potency of VUF 10085. Likewise, mutations of Phe-131(3.32) , Ile-279(6.59) and Tyr-308(7.43) were well tolerated and were critical for the antagonist activity of VUF 10085 but not for that of TAK-779.",

Paired follicular fluid and serum samples were collected from 200 women with advanced stage endometriosis and 140 normal ovulating women during oocyte retrieval. The concentrations of cytokines (pro-inflammatory: IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-γ; anti-inflammatory: IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) and angiogenic molecules (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), adrenomedullin, angiogenin) were determined in follicular fluid and serum using ELISA. Expression of these molecules was subjected to multivariate analysis for the identification of major predictive markers of oocyte and embryo quality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to determine the best cutoff point for the discrimination between mature and immature oocytes in these women. Significant increases in levels of cytokines and angiogenic molecules were observed in women with endometriosis compared to controls (P < 0.001). From the validated partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model, IL-8, IL-12, and adrenomedullin were identified as the most important factors contributing to endometriosis and were negatively associated with oocyte maturity and embryo quality.",

A previous study yielded serological evidence of AD in Korean wild boars, which could spread AD to other animals. A new Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) bait vaccine is required to prevent AD outbreaks in swine. In the present study, we investigated the safety and immunogenicity of a gE-deleted marker vaccine, strain YS-400, in young domestic pigs. The YS-400 strain was propagated in Vero cells, and the trial ADV bait vaccine (a vaccine blister in a matrix including an attractant) was prepared. Pigs were orally immunized with the vaccine (2 mL, 10(7.5) TCID50/mL) delivered using a syringe or in the bait vaccine. The animals were observed for 9 weeks after vaccination, and immunogenicity was assessed using a virus neutralization (VN) test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The YS-400 strain was non-pathogenic to pigs when given orally and induced high VN titers (1:32-1:128) 6 weeks post-administration. Of the pigs given the ADV bait vaccine twice or three times, 40% were seropositive by 2 weeks, and 100% were seropositive by 7 weeks after the first dose. Pigs that consumed the AD bait vaccine three times developed VN titers that were slightly higher than those of pigs given the vaccine twice.",

However, recent observations indicate that even advanced fibrosis is still reversible by removing the causative agents. Anti-fibrotic effects of bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) have been demonstrated by inhibiting CFSCs via cytokines secretion; however, the mechanisms are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the underlying mechanisms by which BMSCs modulate the function of activated CFSCs. After the co-culture of CFSCs with BMSCs supernatants with or without the addition of recombinant rat adrenomedullin (AM)/AM-specific siRNA, western blot analysis was mainly used to detect the differences of relative protein expression on CFSCs. BMSC-secreted adrenomedullin (AM) effectively inhibited the proliferation and activation of CFSCs by suppressing the expression of Ang II and its binding receptor, AT1, which resulted in a reduction of p47-phox formation.",

We investigated whether abdominal imaging features accurately predict patterns of pain. We collected data from participants in the North American Pancreatitis Study 2 Continuation and Validation, a prospective multicenter study of patients with chronic pancreatitis performed at 13 expert centers in the United States from July 2008 through March 2012. Chronic pancreatitis was defined based on the detection of characteristic changes by cross-sectional abdominal imaging, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasonography, or histology analyses. Patients were asked by a physician or trained clinical research coordinator if they had any abdominal pain during the year before enrollment, those who responded \"yes\" were asked to select from a list of 5 pain patterns. By using these patterns, we classified patients' pain based on timing and severity. Abnormal pancreatitis-associated features on abdominal imaging were recorded using standardized case report forms. Data were collected from 518 patients (mean age, 52 ± 14.6 y; 55% male; and 87.6% white). The most common physician-identified etiologies were alcohol (45.8%) and idiopathic (24.3%); 15.6% of patients reported no abdominal pain in the year before enrollment. The most common individual pain pattern was described as constant mild pain with episodes of severe pain and was reported in 45% of patients. The most common imaging findings included pancreatic ductal dilatation (68%), atrophy (57%), and calcifications (55%). Imaging findings were categorized as obstructive for 20% and as inflammatory for 25% of cases. The distribution of individual imaging findings was similar among patients with different patterns of pain. The distribution of pain patterns did not differ among clinically relevant groups of imaging findings.",

Physical function was divided into three categories: aerobic capacity, upper and lower extremity muscular fitness, and mobility. Measures of aerobic capacity included field tests (6-minute walk test, 12-minute walk tests, Rockport 1-mile test, and 2-km walk time) and submaximal/maximal exercise tests on a treadmill or cycle ergometer. Measures of upper and lower extremity muscular fitness included grip strength, one repetition maximum (bench, chest or leg press), muscle endurance tests, and chair stands. The only measure of mobility was the Timed Up and Go test. Of the 1978 studies identified, 85 were eligible for inclusion. Wide ranges of values were reported, reflecting the range of ages, disease severity, treatment type and time since treatment of participants.

Prospective within-patient study in consecutive patients undergoing AVS for primary aldosteronism subtyping. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of baseline and postmetoclopramide lateralization index and relative (to cortisol) aldosterone secretion indices (RASI) for each adrenal gland with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) determined by the four corners criteria as the reference diagnosis. We recruited 93 consecutive patients (mean age: 52 years; women 31%). Metoclopramide increased plasma aldosterone in the inferior vena cava and in both adrenal veins. The postmetoclopramide lateralization index was accurate in identifying APA, but did not increase diagnostic accuracy over baseline lateralization index, because the RASI increased similarly in both sides. Conversely, metoclopramide raised RASI to values more than 0.90 bilaterally in non-APA patients allowing accurate identification of factitious aldosterone suppression. In contrast, RASI was 0.90 or less in 48% contralateral to the tumor in APA patients. Regression analysis showed the APA patients with persistent suppression of RASI contralaterally showed a more florid primary aldosteronism phenotype.",

This NFκB activation may contribute to the progression of renal disease and mediation of fibrosis by various mechanisms. This study was undertaken to test whether this detrimental response may be reversed by vitamin D3 or its analogue paricalcitol. Differentiated mouse podocytes were challenged with glycated bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA), or non-glycated control BSA (in the presence or absence of various concentrations of vitamin D3 (decostriol, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3)) or its active analog paricalcitol. Quantitative mRNA expressions were measured by real-time PCR, whereas protein expressions were determined by Western blotting followed by densitometry. Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein expression of the NFκB subunit p65 (Rel A) were determined by Western blotting. Furthermore, the ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated IκB-α was measured using specific antibodies. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and a capture ELISA assay were used to assess NFκB transactivation in vitro. In addition, NFκB transactivation was also monitored in HEK-NFκBIA reporter cells using live cell luminometry. Podocytes expressed the receptor for vitamin D. The vitamins did not suppress receptor for AGEs (RAGE) expression; instead, they rather upregulated RAGE. Although vitamin D3 and paricalcitol partly and differentially modified some of the studied parameters, both hormones inhibited AGE-BSA-induced NFκB transactivation, presumably by various mechanisms including the upregulation of IκB-α protein, keeping NFκB sequestered in an inactive state in the cytoplasm.",

Mammals synthesize the scavenger proteins haptoglobin and hemopexin, which bind extracellular hemoglobin and heme, respectively. Transfusion of packed red blood cells is a lifesaving therapy for patients with hemorrhagic shock. Because erythrocytes undergo progressive deleterious morphological and biochemical changes during storage, transfusion of packed red blood cells that have been stored for prolonged intervals (SRBCs; stored for 35-40 days in humans or 14 days in mice) increases plasma levels of cell-free hemoglobin and heme. Therefore, in patients with hemorrhagic shock, perfusion-sensitive organs such as the kidneys are challenged not only by hypoperfusion but also by the high concentrations of plasma hemoglobin and heme that are associated with the transfusion of SRBCs. To test whether treatment with exogenous human haptoglobin or hemopexin can ameliorate adverse effects of resuscitation with SRBCs after 2 hours of hemorrhagic shock, mice that received SRBCs were given a coinfusion of haptoglobin, hemopexin, or albumin. Treatment with haptoglobin or hemopexin but not albumin improved the survival rate and attenuated SRBC-induced inflammation. Treatment with haptoglobin retained free hemoglobin in the plasma and prevented SRBC-induced hemoglobinuria and kidney injury. In mice resuscitated with fresh packed red blood cells, treatment with haptoglobin, hemopexin, or albumin did not cause harmful effects.",

We sought to elucidate the contribution of miR-155 in ILC2 expansion using experimental murine models of allergic airway inflammation. To determine the role of miR-155 in the regulation of ILC2s in allergic airway inflammation, miR-155 deficient (miR-155 miR-155 was 10-fold upregulated in WT-derived ILC2s in response to IL-33.

However, it is unclear if LNR offers superior prognostication over total counts of positive nodes and nodes examined. Additionally, the prognostic value of LNR may change if a threshold number of nodes are examined. We evaluated whether LNR is more prognostic than positive nodes and nodes examined, and whether the prognostic value of LNR changes with minimum thresholds. Using the National Cancer Data Base Participant User File, we identified 74,692 incident cases with nodal dissection during 2000-2006. We compared LNR versus counts of examined and positive nodes based on Harrell's C, a measure of predictive ability. We then stratified by total nodes examined: greater versus fewer than ten for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and greater versus fewer than five for inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND). Overall, LNR had a Harrell's C of 0.628 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.625-0.631). Examined and positive nodes were not significantly different from this, with a Harrell's C of 0.625 (95 % CI 0.621-0.630). In ALND, LNR had a Harrell's C of 0.626 (95 % CI 0.610-0.643) with ≥10 nodes versus 0.554 (95 % CI 0.551-0.558) < 10 nodes. In ILND, LNR had a Harrell's C of 0.679 (95 % CI 0.664-0.694) with ≥5 nodes versus C of 0.601 (95 % CI 0.595-0.606) < 5 nodes.",

(HV or barley) is used by traditional healers to treat various inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, without the knowledge of pharmacologic rationale behind its actions. This study was designed to explore the potential scientific mechanism(s) that could explain the use of Hordeum vulgare in traditional medicine as a treatment for various inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. A crude extract and its three fractions were prepared from HV and screened for the inhibition of platelet aggregation and various metabolites of cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism as well as for its effects on certain antioxidant enzymes. Platelet aggregation was monitored using turbidometric principle, AA metabolism through radioimmunoassay and antioxidant enzymes by commercial kits using spectrophotometer. Results show that HV exhibited activities against all human platelet agonists used except adenine diphosphate, and inhibited both COX and LOX pathways of AA metabolism. It also elevated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). However, these activities were distributed in various fractions of HV. Aqueous fraction was most potent in elevating SOD activity; chloroform fraction had concentrated compounds responsible for COX inhibition while n-hexane seems to possess compounds responsible for LOX inhibition as well as the only fraction enhancing the activity of GPx.",

As part of this phenomenon, social networks have attained a prominent role in health care. A variety of medical services is provided over the Internet, including home monitoring, interactive communications between the patient and service providers, and social support, among others. This study emphasizes some of the practical implications of Web-based health social networks for patients and for health care systems. The objective of this study was to assess how participation in a social network among individuals with a chronic condition contributed to patient activation, based on the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). A prospective, cross-sectional survey with a retrospective component was conducted. Data were collected from Camoni, a Hebrew-language Web-based social health network, participants in the diabetes mellitus, pain, hypertension, and depression/anxiety forums, during November 2012 to 2013. Experienced users (enrolled at least 6 months) and newly enrolled received similar versions of the same questionnaire including sociodemographics and PAM. Among 686 participants, 154 of 337 experienced and 123 of 349 newly enrolled completed the questionnaire. Positive correlations (P<.05) were found between frequency and duration of site visits and patient activation, social relationships, and chronic disease knowledge. Men surfed longer than women (χ²3=10.104, P<.05). Experienced users with diabetes surfed more than those with other illnesses and had significantly higher PAM scores (mean, M=69.3, standard deviation, SD=19.1, PAM level 4; Z=-4.197, P<.001) than new users (M=62.8, SD=18.7, PAM level 3). Disease knowledge directly predicted PAM for all users (β=.26 and .21, respectively). Frequency and duration of social health network use were correlated with increased knowledge about a chronic disease. Experienced surfers had higher PAM than newly enrolled, suggesting that continued site use may contribute to increased activation.",

H2S is well-known to act on various ion channels and receptors. In a previous study we reported that H2S increased calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel activity. The goal of the present study is to investigate the modulatory effect of BK channel phosphorylation on the action of H2S on the channel as well as to recalculate and determine the H2S concentrations in aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) solutions. Single channel recordings of GH3, GH4, and GH4 STREX cells were used to analyze channel open probability, amplitude, and open dwell times. H2S was measured with an anion selective electrode. The concentration of H2S produced from NaHS was recalculated taking pH, temperature salinity of the perfusate, and evaporation of H2S into account. The results indicate that from a concentration of 300 μM NaHS, only 11-13%, i.e., 34-41 μM is effective as H2S in solution. GH3, GH4, and GH4 STREX cells respond differently to phosphorylation. BK channel open probability (Po) of all cells lines used was increased by H2S in ATP-containing solutions. PKA prevented the action of H2S on channel Po in GH4 and GH4 STREX, but not in GH3 cells. H2S, high significantly increased Po of all PKG pretreated cells. In the presence of PKC, which lowers channel activity, H2S increased channel Po of GH4 and GH4 STREX, but not those of GH3 cells. H2S increased open dwell times of GH3 cells in the absence of ATP significantly. A significant increase of dwell times with H2S was also observed in the presence of okadaic acid.",

In this study, we investigated whether astaxanthin (ASTX), a xanthophyll carotenoid, can inhibit fibrogenic effects of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), a key fibrogenic cytokine, in HSCs. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was measured in LX-2, an immortalized human HSC cell line. Quantitative realtime PCR, Western blot, immunocytochemical analysis, and in-cell Western blot were performed to determine mRNA and protein of fibrogenic genes, and the activation of Smad3 in TGFβ1-activated LX-2 cells and primary mouse HSCs. In LX-2 cells, ROS accumulation induced by tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide and TGFβ1 was abolished by ASTX. ASTX significantly decreased TGFβ1-induced α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and procollagen type 1, alpha 1 (Col1A1) mRNA as well as α-SMA protein levels. Knockdown of Smad3 showed the significant role of Smad3 in the expression of α-SMA and Col1A1, but not TGFβ1, in LX-2 cells. ASTX attenuated TGFβ1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation with a concomitant inhibition of Smad3, Smad7, TGFβ receptor I (TβRI), and TβRII expression. The inhibitory effect of ASTX on HSC activation was confirmed in primary mouse HSCs as evidenced by decreased mRNA and protein levels of α-SMA during activation.",

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all epidemiological evidence to clarify association of diabetes with risk of VTE. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE to retrieve all relevant articles. Pooled effect estimates were calculated through a random-effects model. Sixteen articles involving 803,627,121 participants and 10,429,227 VTE patients were included.

No previous research has focused on the expression of miR-361-5p and its exact prognostic role in breast cancer (BC). In this study, a tissue microarray (TMA)-based miRNA detection in situ hybridization (ISH) with LNA probe was used to detect miR-361-5p expression in 375 BC tissue. The expression level of miR-361-5p in BC and its potential prognostic value was investigated. Positive miR-361-5p staining was observed in 78.7% (N=295; 78.7% positive, 21.3% negative) in the 375 cases.

However, the specific HDAC that might serve as a therapeutic target and the associated upstream and downstream molecules involved in regulating hypertension remain unknown. Our study was aimed at investigating whether a selective inhibitor of class II HDAC (MC1568) modulates hypertension, elucidating the underlying mechanism. Hypertension was established by administering angiotensin II (Ang II) to mice before treatment with MC1568. SBP was measured. Treatment with MC1568 reduced elevated SBP; attenuated arterial remodeling in the kidney's small arteries and thoracic aorta; and inhibited cell cycle regulatory gene expression, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, DNA synthesis, and VSMC hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Ang II enhanced the expression of phosphorylated HDAC4 and GATA-binding factor 6 (GATA6) proteins, which were specifically localized in the cytoplasm of cells in the arteries of kidneys and in aortas. Forced expression and knockdown of HDAC4 increased and decreased, respectively, the proliferation and expression of cell cycle genes in VSMCs. GATA6, a newly described binding partner of HDAC4, markedly enhanced the size and number of VSMCs. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα (CaMKIIα), but not HDAC4, translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to Ang II. CaMKIIα and protein kinase D1 were associated with VSMC hypertrophy and hyperplasia via direct interaction with HDAC4. MC1568 treatment weakened the association between HDAC4 and CaMKIIα.",

For comparison of data from different methods and laboratories, suitable calibrators are essential. A suitable calibrator must have a refractive index (RI) as close to that of EV as possible but the RI of EV is currently unknown. To measure EV, RI requires accurate knowledge of size and light scattering. These are difficult to measure as most EVs cannot be resolved by light microscopy and their diameter is smaller than the wavelength of visible light. However, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) provides both size and relative light scattering intensity (rLSI) values. We therefore sought to determine whether it was possible to use NTA to measure the RI of individual EVs. NTA was used to measure the rLSI and size of polystyrene and silica microspheres of known size and RI (1.470 and 1.633, respectively) and of EV isolated from a wide range of cells. We developed software, based on Mie scattering code, to calculate particle RI from the rLSI data. This modelled theoretical scattering intensities for polystyrene and silica microspheres of known size (100 and 200 nm) and RI. The model was verified using data from the polystyrene and silica microspheres. Size and rLSI data for each vesicle were processed by the software to generate RI values. The following modal RI measurements were obtained: fresh urinary EV 1.374, lyophilised urinary EV 1.367, neuroblastoma EV 1.393, blood EV 1.398, EV from activated platelets 1.390, small placental EV 1.364-1.375 and 1.398-1.414 for large placental EV (>200 nm). Large placental EV had a significantly higher RI than small placental EV (p<0.0001). The spread of RI values was narrower for small EV than for the more heterogeneous large EV.",

We performed histopathologic and immunohistochemical comparisons of 6 GPDACs with 6 duodenal adenocarcinomas (DACs) and 24 conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (cPDACs). Both groups were adjusted to ensure similar mean tumor size. Representative loupe image showed prominent duodenal invasion and slight pancreatic invasion. Groove pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas exhibited different mucins and cytokeratin profiles in DACs, but cPDACs and small branch pancreatic ducts had the same profiles. Histopathologic analysis of GPDACs showed a significantly higher incidence of duodenal invasion and well differentiation than cPDACs, although the incidences of lymph node metastasis, angiolymphatic invasion, and neural invasion were similar. Immunohistochemical analysis of GPDACs showed a significantly lower frequency of abnormal Smad4 immunolabeling, and fewer GPDAC samples exhibited abnormal immunolabeling for MUC1, p16, Smad4, and p53 than cPDACs.",

The various conventional methods for its diagnosis are laborious and not easily reproducible. Molecular quantification methods have been reported recently, but the specific risk factors they might identify remain unclear. A prospective multicenter national study included pregnant women at risk of preterm birth. A quantitative molecular tool using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension quantified Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacilli, Mycoplasma hominis, and the human albumin gene (for quality control). In 813 pregnancies, high vaginal loads of either or both of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis were associated with preterm birth (hazard ratio [HR], 3.9; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.1-14.1; P = .031). A high vaginal load of A. vaginae was significantly associated with shortened time to delivery and therefore pregnancy length.

In addition, we evaluated the effect of detailed phenotyping on these genetic associations. Case-control study. We included 292 cCSC patients, 1147 AMD patients, and 1311 control individuals. We genotyped SNPs at 19 AMD-associated loci and 6 additional SNPs at the complement factor H (CFH) locus. Phenotyping of all patients was based on fundoscopy, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography. We measured the allele frequencies of 25 AMD-associated SNPs and CFH haplotype frequencies in patients with cCSC and the effect of phenotypic subdivision of cCSC on genetic associations. One SNP in ARMS2 (rs10490924) was significant after Bonferroni correction (Punadjusted=0.002; odds ratio [OR]=0.64). The SNPs at 3 other AMD loci (CFH, TNFRSF10A, ADAMTS9) showed a trend toward association with typical cCSC. Further analysis of the CFH locus identified 2 SNPs that significantly conferred increased risk for cCSC and 1 that was protective. The CFH-H3 haplotype was also found to be protective (P=0.01; OR=0.54). Using multimodal imaging, 197 patients were classified as having typical cCSC, 52 patients had unilateral abnormalities on FA that were otherwise typical of cCSC, and 43 patients had a clinical picture that could be compatible with cCSC, but with features that could also indicate other macular diseases. Significant differences of the minor allele frequencies of the tested SNPs were observed between these 3 phenotypic subgroups.",

To investigate the effects and mechanisms of STDP treatment on atherosclerosis. ApoE deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice were utilized to evaluate the effect of STDP treatment (30 mg/kg/day) on atherosclerotic lesions. Histopathological features of atherosclerotic lesions, serum levels of lipid proteins, parameters of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by H&E staining, Masson's trichrome staining and ELISA, respectively. Real-time PCR analyses were performed to examine the aortic expression of atherosclerosis-associated microRNAs. The STDP treatment resulted in attenuated atherosclerotic lesion manifested by reduced lipid deposition, fibrosis and oxidative stress. It also led to increase in serum levels of GSH and SOD, decrease in MDA, decrease in CHO, TG, LDL, ox-LDL and increase in HDL, respectively. Additionally, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α and γ-IFN were markedly reduced by STDP treatment.

Cells in culture medium were challenged with 11-25 mM glucose with or without nelfinavir (1-10 μM), saquinavir (1-10 μM) and atazanavir (5-20 μM), respectively for 24 h to determine insulin secretion. The cells were further treated with nelfinavir (10 μM), saquinavir (10 μM), atazanavir (20 μM) with and without naringin or glibenclamide (10 μM) for 24 h to determine insulin secretion, lipid peroxidation, Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity, glutathione (GSH) levels, ATP production and caspase-3 and-9 activities, respectively. Glucose-dependent insulin secretion was significantly reduced by PIs in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with either naringin or glibenclamide significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activities and also increased glutathione (GSH) and ATP levels in the cells that were treated with PIs. Furthermore, naringin or glibenclamide significantly reduced caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities in cells that were treated with PIs.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of sudden and gradual hypo-osmotic challenge on chondrocyte morphology and biomechanics. Bovine articular chondrocytes were exposed to a reduction in extracellular osmolality from 327 to 153 mOsmol/kg applied either suddenly (<5 s) or gradually (over 180 min). Temporal changes in cell diameter and the existence of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) were quantified along with changes in cortical actin and chromatin condensation. The cellular viscoelastic mechanical properties were determined by micropipette aspiration. In response to a sudden hypo-osmotic stress, 66% of chondrocytes exhibited an increase in diameter followed by RVD, whilst 25% showed no RVD. By contrast, cells exposed to gradual hypo-osmotic stress exhibited reduced cell swelling without subsequent RVD. There was an increase in the equilibrium modulus for cells exposed to sudden hypo-osmotic stress. However, gradual hypo-osmotic challenge had no effect on cell mechanical properties. This cell stiffening response to sudden hypo-osmotic challenge was abolished when actin organization was disrupted with cytochalasin D or RVD inhibited with REV5901. Both sudden and gradual hypo-osmotic challenge reduced cortical F-actin distribution and caused chromatin decondensation.",

Pulmonary morbidity includes restriction, decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), respiratory muscle weakness, abnormal imaging, and pulmonary hypertension. Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (aPBSCT) is an effective treatment for POEMS syndrome. It is unknown if aPBSCT improves pulmonary morbidity. We hypothesize pulmonary morbidity will improve following aPBSCT. Retrospective cohort study of POEMS syndrome aPBSCT recipients from 2000 to 2010. Demographic, pulmonary function test (PFT), echocardiogram, cytokine, and imaging data at baseline and after aPBSCT were abstracted. Pre- and post-transplant data were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank and McNemar's tests. 53 patients met criteria. Median improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and total lung capacity (TLC) after transplant were 180, 315 and 350 ml respectively (median follow-up of 1.1 years). DLCO, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) improved by a median of 11, 12.5 and 10% predicted respectively. RVSP and chest imaging also improved. Vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-6 decreased by a median of 334 and 2 pg/ml respectively. All comparisons were statistically significant.

Although the aortic pathologies are believed primarily due to congenital copper deficiencies in connective tissue, perinatal copper supplementation does not produce significant therapeutic effects, hinting additional mechanisms in the symptom development, such as an independent effect of the ATP7A mutations during adulthood. We investigated if bone marrow from blotchy mice contributes to these symptoms. For these experiments, bone marrow from blotchy mice (blotchy marrow group) and healthy littermate controls (control marrow group) was used to reconstitute recipient mice (irradiated male low-density lipoprotein receptor -/- mice), which were then infused with angiotensin II (1,000 ng/kg/min) for 4 weeks. By using Mann-Whitney U test, our results showed that there was no significant difference in the copper concentrations in plasma and hematopoietic cells between these 2 groups. And plasma level of triglycerides was significantly reduced in blotchy marrow group compared with that in control marrow group (P < 0.05), whereas there were no significant differences in cholesterol and phospholipids between these 2 groups. Furthermore, a bead-based multiplex immunoassay showed that macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, MCP-3, MCP-5, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A production was significantly reduced in the plasma of blotchy marrow group compared with that in control marrow group (P < 0.05). More important, although angiotensin II infusion increased maximal external aortic diameters in thoracic and abdominal segments, there was no significant difference in the aortic diameters between these 2 groups. Furthermore, aortic ruptures, including transmural breaks of the elastic laminae in the abdominal segment and lethal rupture in the thoracic segment, were observed in blotchy marrow group but not in control marrow group; however, there was no significant difference in the incidence of aortic ruptures between these 2 groups (P = 0.10; Fisher's exact test).",

A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cancer-associated cachexia (CAC), coupled with effective therapeutic approaches, will improve management of progressive functional impairment in cancer patients. Salidroside, a phenylpropanoid glycoside in Rhodiola rosea L, has been reported to possess potential anti-fatigue, anti-ageing, and anti-Alzheimer's disease properties. It is widely consumed as a nutritional supplement, but its effects on CAC and the possible mechanism remain a mystery. In the murine models of cachexia induced by CT-26 and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumour, respectively, main features of CAC were determined after treatment of salidroside or chemotherapy. In vitro experiments were performed using murine C2C12 myotubes, which were treated by tumour necrosis factor-α. Levels of several critical muscle-related signal proteins such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p-mTOR, and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) were examined using western blot both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we showed the exciting effect of salidroside on the treatment of CAC. In CT-26 and LLC models, respectively, salidroside treatment could effectively preserve the tumour-free body weight, decrease loss of adipose and gastrocnemius muscles, alleviate tumour burden, and prolong their survival time. Additionally, in combined chemotherapy, salidroside could synergistically enhance the anti-tumour activity of cisplatin, especially decreased or eliminated chemotherapy-induced cachexia. Further analysis demonstrated that salidroside could significantly increase expression of mTOR, p-mTOR, and MyHC in gastrocnemius muscle. Also, results in vitro showed that salidroside could not only obviously increase mTOR, p-mTOR, and MyHC expression in C2C12 myotubes but also effectively rescue their down-regulation induced by tumour necrosis factor-α.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize HRS inhuman hepatocellular HepG2 cells and to explore the molecular mechanism(s) mediating this response. HepG2 cells were exposed to various single doses of γ radiation (from 0 Gy to 4 Gy), and then were assayed at subsequent time-points. Survival curves were then generated using a linear-quadratic (LQ) equation and a modified induced repair model (MIRM). The percentage of cells in the G1, G2/M, and S phases of the cell cycle were also examined using propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. Levels of total cell division cyclin 25C (Cdc25C) and phosphorylated Cdc25C were examined by Western blotting. Low-dose γ radiation (<0.3 Gy) induced HRS in HepG2 cells, while doses of 0.3, 0.5, and 2.0 Gy γ radiation significantly arrested HepG2 cells in the G2/M phase. While total Cdc25C levels remained unchanged after irradiation, levels of phosphorylated Cdc25C markedly increased 6, 16, and 24 h after treatment with 0.5 or 2.0 Gy radiation, and they peaked after 16 h. The latter observation is consistent with the G2/M arrest that was detected following irradiation.",

Oxidative stress, inflammation and pulmonary artery remodeling are important components in PAH. Ellagic acid (EA) is a phenolic compound with anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative properties. This study aimed to investigate whether EA could prevent the development of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received EA (30 and 50mg/kg/day) or vehicle one day after a single-dose of monocrotaline (MCT, 60mg/kg). Hemodynamic changes, right ventricular hypertrophy, and lung morphological features were assessed 4weeks later. Activation of the NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome pathway in the lungs was assessed using Western blot analysis. MCT induced PAH, oxidative stress, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vehicle-treated rats. EA reduced the right ventricle systolic pressure, the right ventricular hypertrophy and the wall thickness/external diameter ratio of the pulmonary arteries compared with vehicle. EA also inhibited the MCT-induced elevation of oxidative stress, NLRP3, and caspase-1, IL-β in the lungs and the elevated levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and inflammatory cytokines in serum.",

We have previously determined that cells from APL patients show increased expression of genes regulated by hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) compared to normal promyelocytes. HIFs regulate crucial aspects of solid tumor progression and are currently being implicated in leukemogenesis. To investigate the contribution of hypoxia-related signaling in APL compared to other AML sub-types, we reverse engineered a transcriptional network from gene expression profiles of AML patients' samples, starting from a list of direct target genes of HIF-1. A HIF-1-dependent subnetwork of genes specifically dysregulated in APL was derived from the comparison between APL and other AMLs. Interestingly, this subnetwork shows a unique involvement of genes related to extracellular matrix interaction and cell migration, with decreased expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and increased expression of genes implicated in motility and invasion, thus unveiling the presence of characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We observed that the genes of this subnetwork, whose dysregulation shows a peculiar pattern across different AML sub-types, distinguish malignant from normal promyelocytes, thus ruling out dependence on a myeloid developmental stage. Also, expression of these genes is reversed upon treatment of APL-derived NB4 cells with all-trans retinoic acid and cell differentiation.",

The standardized iridoid fraction from BPE at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight was administered orally, twice daily for 5 days for prevention from aspirin, ethanol, cold-restraint stress (CRS), and pylorus ligation (PL)-induced ulcers. Estimation of the antioxidant enzyme activity was carried out in a CRS-induced ulcer model, and various gastric secretion parameters including volume of gastric juice, acid output, and pH value were estimated in the PL-induced ulcer model. BPE showed a dose-dependent ulcer protective effect in PL (18.67%-66.26% protection), aspirin (24.65%-63.25% protection), CRS (20.77%-59.42% protection), and EtOH (16.93%-77.04% protection)-induced ulcers.

This study investigates the effect of mutation of dmr1 on resistance to the ascomycete pathogens Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum, which cause Fusarium Ear Blight (FEB) disease on small grain cereals. We initially found that the dmr1-2 mutant allele confers increased resistance to F. culmorum and F. graminearum silique infection, and decreased colonisation of rosette leaves. Meanwhile the dmr1-1 allele supports less rosette leaf colonisation but has wild type silique resistance. Three additional dmr1 alleles were subsequently examined for altered F. culmorum susceptibility and all showed increased silique resistance, while leaf colonisation was reduced in two (dmr1-3 and dmr1-4). Amino acid analysis of dmr1 siliques revealed homoserine accumulation, which is undetectable in wild type plants. Exogenous application of L-homoserine reduced bud infection in both dmr1 and wild type plants, whilst D-homoserine application did not. Delayed leaf senescence was also observed in dmr1 plants compared to wild type and correlated with reduced Fusarium leaf colonisation.",

This study proposes a parametric method for automatically analyzing perfused tissue from volumetric dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) computed tomography (CT) scans and assesses whether this 4-dimensional (4D) DCE approach is more robust and accurate than conventional, region-of-interest (ROI)-based CT methods in quantifying tumor perfusion with preliminary evaluation in metastatic brain cancer. Functional parameter reproducibility and analysis of sensitivity to imaging resolution and arterial input function were evaluated in image sets acquired from a 320-slice CT with a controlled flow phantom and patients with brain metastases, whose treatments were planned for stereotactic radiation surgery and who consented to a research ethics board-approved prospective imaging biomarker study. A voxel-based temporal dynamic analysis (TDA) methodology was used at baseline, at day 7, and at day 20 after treatment. The ability to detect changes in kinetic parameter maps in clinical data sets was investigated for both 4D TDA and conventional 2D ROI-based analysis methods. A total of 7 brain metastases in 3 patients were evaluated over the 3 time points. The 4D TDA method showed improved spatial efficacy and accuracy of perfusion parameters compared to ROI-based DCE analysis (P<.005), with a reproducibility error of less than 2% when tested with DCE phantom data. Clinically, changes in transfer constant from the blood plasma into the extracellular extravascular space (Ktrans) were seen when using TDA, with substantially smaller errors than the 2D method on both day 7 post radiation surgery (±13%; P<.05) and by day 20 (±12%; P<.04).

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA, marker of endothelial dysfunction) and soluble CD14 (sCD14, marker of monocyte activation) were measured in plasma from two previously established cross-sectional cohorts: cohort A including 50 untreated and 50 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV-infected individuals with previously assessed coagulation and platelet function and cohort B including 105 HIV-infected individuals on ART and 105 uninfected controls with previously assessed coronary artery calcium score, myocardial perfusion defects, and carotid intima-media thickness. Concentrations of ADMA were higher in HIV-infected individuals compared with uninfected controls, and higher ADMA was found in ART-treated compared with untreated HIV-infected individuals. ADMA was associated with viral load, sCD14, D-dimer, and low CD4 T-cell count in untreated HIV infection. Only viral load remained significant in multivariate analyses. In ART-treated HIV-infected individuals, ADMA was not associated with coronary artery calcium score, myocardial perfusion defects, or intima-media thickness.",

We investigated the cytokine response in skin and in serum in sepsis and its relation to multiorgan failure (MOF) and survival. Cytokines were analysed in serum and in suction blister fluid of intact skin of 44 patients with severe sepsis and 15 healthy controls. Blister fluid and serum samples were collected within 48 h of the first sepsis-induced organ failure. This is a substudy of a larger follow-up study on wound healing in sepsis. Cytokine levels were higher in patients with sepsis vs. controls (interleukin [IL]-10, blisters: 65.9 vs. 4.3 pg/ml, P < 0.001, serum: 25.7 vs. 4.5 pg/ml, P = 0.004; IL-6, blisters: 41.9 vs. 0.03 pg/ml, P < 0.001, serum: 45.5 vs. 2.1 pg/ml, P < 0.001).

The early diagnosis of AKI during its treatable phases and implementation of appropriate treatment protocols can improve outcomes for this group of patients. A promising biomarker for AKI is neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). This study evaluated the diagnostic value of NGAL concentrations in serum and in urine for patients developing AKI as an early complication of AP compared to AP patients without AKI. The study group composed of 65 patients (34 men and 31 women) with a mean age of 62.2 ± 16 years with AP and hospitalized in the Surgery Department of the Direct Hospital in Sucha Beskidzka, Poland between January and December 2014. Serum NGAL (sNGAL) levels were measured with the BioVendor ELISA kit, and urine NGAL (uNGAL) with the Abbott ARCHITECT Analyzer. In the early phase of AP, 11 patients (17%) developed AKI, including 10 patients with stage 1 and one with stage 2. AKI was associated with more severe AP, higher BISAP scores, the need for more intensive treatment, longer hospital stays and higher mortality. Both serum and urine NGAL concentrations were signifcantly higher in patients with AKI throughout the study and signifcantly predicted AKI in simple and multiple logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities. Serum and urine NGAL concentrations were signifcantly correlated with levels of serum urea, creatinine, urine albumin, and the maximum change in serum creatinine. Serum and urine NGAL levels also correlated positively with direct neutrophil counts and CRP concentrations throughout the study.",

What's the correct answer and why? ### Question: Do aversive stimuli drive drug seeking in a state of low dopamine tone? ### Context: Stressors negatively impact emotional state and drive drug seeking, in part, by modulating the activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Unfortunately, the rapid regulation of dopamine signaling by the aversive stimuli that cause drug seeking is not well characterized. In a series of experiments, we scrutinized the subsecond regulation of dopamine signaling by the aversive stimulus, quinine, and tested its ability to cause cocaine seeking. Additionally, we examined the midbrain regulation of both dopamine signaling and cocaine seeking by the stress-sensitive peptide, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF). Combining fast-scan cyclic voltammetry with behavioral pharmacology, we examined the effect of intraoral quinine administration on nucleus accumbens dopamine signaling and hedonic expression in 21 male Sprague-Dawley rats. We tested the role of CRF in modulating aversion-induced changes in dopamine concentration and cocaine seeking by bilaterally infusing the CRF antagonist, CP-376395, into the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We found that quinine rapidly reduced dopamine signaling on two distinct time scales. We determined that CRF acted in the VTA to mediate this reduction on only one of these time scales. Further, we found that the reduction of dopamine tone and quinine-induced cocaine seeking were eliminated by blocking the actions of CRF in the VTA during the experience of the aversive stimulus.",

The effects of CHE and liver disease are determined by cognitive reserve—the ability of the brain to cope with increasing damage while continuing to function—and are assessed by composite intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. We examined cognitive reserve as a determinant of HRQOL in patients with cirrhosis. We performed a prospective study of 118 outpatients with cirrhosis without overt HE (age, 56 y). We studied cognition using the standard paper-pencil battery; patients with below-normal results for more than 2 tests were considered to have CHE. We also assessed HRQOL (using the sickness impact profile [SIP]), psychosocial and physical scores (a high score indicates reduced HRQOL), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores, and cognitive reserve (using the Barona Index, a validated IQ analysis, based on age, race, education, residence area, and occupation). Cognitive reserve was divided into average and high groups (<109 or >109), and MELD and SIP scores were compared. We performed regression analyses, using total SIP score and psychosocial and physical dimensions as outcomes, with cognitive reserve, CHE, and MELD score as predictors. Study participants had average MELD scores of 9, and 14 years of education; 81% were white, 63% were urban residents, their mean IQ was 108 ± 8, and 54% had average cognitive reserve (the remaining 46% had high reserves). CHE was diagnosed in 49% of patients. Cognitive reserve was lower in patients with CHE (109) than without (105; P = .02). Cognitive reserve correlated with total SIP and psychosocial score (both r = -0.4; P < .001) and physical score (r = -0.3; P = .01), but not MELD score (P = .8). Patients with high cognitive reserve had a better HRQOL, despite similar MELD scores. In regression analyses, cognitive reserve was a significant predictor of total SIP (P < .001), psychosocial (P < .001), and physical scores (P < .03), independent of CHE, MELD, or psychiatric disorders.",

Micro RNA (miR)-17-92 cluster has strong immune regulatory activities. This study tests a hypothesis that miR-17-92 cluster suppresses IL-10 expression in B cells of Asro patients. Patients with Asro were recruited into this study. Peripheral blood samples were collected from the patients. B cells were isolated from the blood samples and analyzed to elucidate the role of miR-17-92 in the regulation of IL-10 expression. Peripheral B cells from patients with Asro show lower levels of IL-10 than that from healthy subjects. The IL-10 expression in the B cells is negatively correlated with the expression of miR-19a in the B cells. The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-4 in Asro patients were higher than healthy subjects. Exposure to TNF-α or IFN-γ or IL-4 suppressed IL-10 expression in B cells via increasing the expression of miR-19a in B cells, which could be abolished by Inhibition of miR-19a.",

A total of 45 540 ostensibly healthy men aged 55-69 years who underwent routine health check-ups at Beijing Shijitan Hospital between 2008 and 2015 were included in the study. All the men underwent detailed clinical evaluations. PSA mass density was calculated (serum PSA level × plasma volume ÷ prostate volume) for simultaneously adjusting plasma volume and prostate volume. According to the modified National Cholesterol Education Programme-Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP) III criteria, patients were dichotomized by the presence of MetS, and differences in PSA density and PSA mass density were compared between groups. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of MetS on serum PSA levels. When larger prostate volume in men with MetS was adjusted for, both PSA density and PSA mass density in men with MetS were significantly lower than in men without MetS, and the estimated difference in mean serum PSA level between men with and without MetS was greater than that before adjusting for prostate volume. In the multivariate regression model, the presence of MetS was independently associated with an 11.3% decline in serum PSA levels compared with the absence of MetS. In addition, increasing number of positive MetS components was significantly and linearly associated with decline in serum PSA levels.",

The MTT and transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effect of Celecoxib on proliferation and invasion ability of ovarian cancer cell lines, respectively. Western blot was carried out to detect the expression of epithelial phenotypes, E-cadherin and Keratin, and mesenchymal phenotypes, N-cadherin and Vimentin, as well as p-AKT, p-ERK and ZEB1. ZEB1 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to downregulate the expression of ZEB1 to further inquiring into the downstream of Celecoxib-induced EMT. Cellular morphological assessment revealed that both A2780 and SKOV3 cells gradually appeared in the morphology of mesenchymal cells after Celecoxib treatment. The MTT assay demonstrated that celecoxib had no effect on cell proliferation. Transwell assay showed that Celecoxib significantly increased the cell invasion ability. Western blot data proved that the expression of E-cadherin and keratin was elevated, whereas the expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin was decreased in a dose-dependent manner compared with the untreated cells, the expression of p-AKT, p-ERK and ZEB1 was also obviously elevated.

B7-H4 expression was detected in 67 cases of cervical cancer using immunohistochemical staining. Tumor-infiltrating CD8(+)T, CD4(+)T, and FOXP3(+) (Forkhead Box P3) T lymphocytes and their levels of IFN-γ and TGF-β₁ production were determined by immunofluorescent double-staining. After the peripheral blood T lymphocytes of patients were co-cultured with B7-H4, proliferation, apoptosis, and cell subtypes were analyzed using flow cytometry. Cytokines in the supernatant were detected by ELISA. B7-H4 was expressed in 46% (31/67) of the cases of cervical cancer. The number of infiltrating CD8(+)T lymphocytes and their IFN-γ production in positive B7-H4 expression cervical cancers was significantly lower than in negative B7-H4 cases (P<0.01, P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between cases positive and negative for B7-H4 with respect to infiltrating FOXP3(+)T and CD4(+)T cells or TGF-β1 production.

However, its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the expression and function of miR-622 in ESCC. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we detected miR-622 expression in ESCC cell lines and primary tumor tissues. The association of miR-622 expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis was also analyzed. Then, the effects of miR-622 on the biological behavior of ESCC cells were investigated. At last, the potential regulatory function of miR-622 on E2F1 expression was confirmed. miR-622 was found to be down-regulated in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Decreased miR-622 expression was closely correlated with aggressive clinicopathological features and poor overall survival. Multivariate regression analysis corroborated that low level of miR-622 expression was an independent unfavourable prognostic factor for patients with ESCC. Up-regulation of miR-622 could significantly reduce ESCC cell proliferation, enhance cell apoptosis, and impair cell invasion and migration in vitro, while down-regulation of miR-622 showed opposite effects. Further, E2F1 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-622 by using Luciferase Reporter Assay.",

However, the association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and LAC in men with metabolic syndrome (MS) is unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the association between NAFLD and LAC in men with MS. Subjects were 1055 men with MS who underwent a regular health check-up and drank less 20 g/day of alcohol. A distinction was made between non-drinkers and light drinkers and the association between NAFLD and LAC in men with MS was elucidated. NAFLD was referred as fatty liver with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels ≧31 IU/L in this study. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and the prevalence of NAFLD were significantly lower in light drinkers than in non-drinkers. Logistic regression analysis showed body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), uric acid (UA), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), visceral fat type MS and LAC (odds ratios: 0.654; 95% confidence intervals: 0.473-0.906; <0.05) were significant predictors of the prevalence of NAFLD.",

In this study we aimed to investigate, which structural component of biglycan is responsible for its cardiocytoprotective effect and to further explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the cytoprotection. A pilot study was conducted to demonstrate that both native (glycanated) and deglycanated biglycan can attenuate cell death induced by SI/R in a dose-dependent manner in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes isolated from Wistar rats. In separate experiments, we have shown that similarly to glycanated biglycan, recombinant human biglycan core protein (rhBGNc) protects cardiomyocytes against SI/R injury. In contrast, the glycosaminoglycan component dermatan sulfate had no significant effect on cell viability, while chondroitin sulfate further enhanced cell death induced by SI/R. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with rhBGNc reverses the effect of SI/R upon markers of necrosis, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and autophagy. We have also shown that pharmacological blockade of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling or its downstream mediators (IRAK1/4, ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases) abolished the cytoprotective effect of rhBGNc against SI/R injury. Pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with rhBGNc for 20h resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation and NO production without having significant effect on phosphorylation of ERK1/2, STAT3, and on the production of superoxide. Treatment over 10min and 1h with rhBGNc increased ERK1 phosphorylation, while the SI/R-induced increase in superoxide production was attenuated by rhBGNc. Blockade of NO synthesis also prevented the cardiocytoprotective effect of rhBGNc.",

The area under the curve of plasma levels over time of SN-38, an active metabolite of CPT-11, was previously reported to correlate with the pre-treatment serum total bilirubin level (PTB). However, there are no established criteria for selecting CPT-11 dose on the basis of PTB. Therefore, we evaluated PTB as an indicator for the optimal CPT-11 dose. Retrospective analyses were conducted in patients administered CPT-11 as a single agent at the Osaka National Hospital from June 2006 to July 2013. Data obtained during the first 28 days following CPT-11 administration were analyzed to compare PTB between patients with and without grade 3-4 neutropenia and grade 3-4 diarrhea. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal PTB cutoff value for PTB-associated toxicity. Subgroup analysis was performed comparing the incidence of toxicity in patients with PTB values below or above the cutoff value. Although PTB incidence was significantly higher in patients who developed grade 3-4 neutropenia than in those who did not, PTB was not associated with grade 3-4 diarrhea. The PTB cutoff value for association with grade 3-4 neutropenia occurrence was set at 0.8 mg/dL. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) significantly elevated to 21% in patients with PTB ≥0.8 mg/dL, whereas that of patients with PTB <0.8 mg/dL was 4%. In the subgroup analysis, no difference was found in the neutropenia incidence between patients treated with a dose below 80 mg/m(2) and those treated on a weekly schedule.",

Mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been extensively investigated, and ERCC1 has emerged as a key player due to its central role in the repair of cisplatin-induced DNA lesions. However, clinical data have not unequivocally confirmed ERCC1 status as a predictor of the response to cisplatin treatment. Therefore, we employed an autochthonous mouse model of Kras-driven lung adenocarcinoma resembling human lung adenocarcinoma to investigate the role of Ercc1 in the response to cisplatin treatment. Our data show that Ercc1 deficiency in Tp53-deficient murine lung adenocarcinoma induces a more aggressive tumor phenotype that displays enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, tumors that relapsed after cisplatin treatment in our model develop a robust etoposide sensitivity that is independent of the Ercc1 status and depends solely on previous cisplatin exposure. Our results provide a solid rationale for further investigation of the possibility of preselection of lung adenocarcinoma patients according to the functional ERCC1- and mutational TP53 status, where functionally ERCC1-incompetent patients might benefit from sequential cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy.",

However, the relationship between IQGAP1 and Dvl in tumor tissues is unclear. We used immunohistochemistry to assess the expressions of IQGAP1 and Dvl in a cohort of 111 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Association of their localization expressions with clinicopathological factors was also analyzed. The positive rate of IQGAP1 in primary tumors was 48.6% (54/111) for its cytoplamic expression, 9.0% (10/111) for nuclear expression and 31.5% (35/111) for membranous expression; the positive rate of Dvl was 65.8% (73/111) for cytoplamic expression, 9.9% (11/111) for nuclear expression and 10.8% (12/111) for membranous expression. Coexpression rate of IQGAP1 and Dvl was 77.8% (42/54) in the cytoplasm, 80.0% (8/10) in the nucleus and 8.6% (3/35) in the membrane. Coexpression of IQGAP1 and Dvl in the cytoplasm and nucleus were significantly correlated (P<0.05), but not in the membrane (P>0.05). The positive expression rates of cyclin D1 and c-myc were significantly higher in the group of IQGAP1 and Dvl coexpression in the nucleus than that in the cytoplasm. Coexpression rate of IQGAP1 and Dvl in the cytoplasm and nucleus was significantly higher in lymph nodal metastases (63.3%, 19/30) than in primary growths (38.3%, 31/81), correlating with poor prognosis. Five-year survival time after resection in the group with their coexpression in the cytoplasm and nucleus was significantly lower than that with no coexpression (44.705±3.355 vs 58.403±2.543 months, p<0.05).",

After Institutional Review Board's approval, all endosonographic procedures performed by interventional pulmonary between July 2013 and June 2015 were reviewed. Those including biopsy of sub-diaphragmatic sites were then selected for analysis. Over the study interval, 45 sub-diaphragmatic biopsy procedures (25 left adrenal glands, 7 liver, and 13 celiac node) were performed with EUS-B. In all cases, cellular adequacy was present, and samples were large enough for immunohistochemistry and any relevant ancillary studies.

Two-hundred forty consecutive T2DM patients (HbA1c≤7.0%) without CVD were included to calculate the 10-y CVD risk by Framingham risk score (FRS), and divided into 3 groups: low-risk group (FRS≤10%), intermediate-risk group (>10%, ≤20%) and high-risk group (>20%). Inter-group differences of GV were determined by comparing the SD of blood glucose (SDBG), mean amplitudes of glycemic excursion (MAGE), and mean of daily differences (MODD) gathered from 72-h continuous glucose monitoring system. The levels of SDBG and MAGE significantly increased along with the raises of 10-y CVD risk of T2DM patients (p<0.01). FRS was positively correlated with age, systolic blood pressure, SDBG and MAGE (r=0.717, 0.525, 0.509 and 0.485 respectively, p<0.01), while negatively correlated with the level of HDL-C (r=-0.348, p<0.01). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that increased MAGE [OR: 1.623(1.198-2.316), p<0.001] and patients with high urine albumin excretion rates [OR: 1.743(1.247-2.793), p<0.001] were independent predictors for high 10-y CVD risk.",

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) possesses antiinflammatory effects. Given that calcification occurs in adult valves, we hypothesized that AVICs from adult valves more likely undergo a proosteogenic phenotypic change than those from pediatric valves and that may be related to different Stat3 activation in the response of those two age groups to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). AVICs from healthy human aortic valve tissues were treated with TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. Cellular levels of TLR4, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as phosphorylation of p-38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-κβ (NF-κβ), and Stat3, were analyzed. Toll-like receptor 4 protein levels were comparable between adult and pediatric AVICs. Adult cells produce markedly higher levels of the above markers after TLR4 stimulation, which is negatively associated with phosphorylation of Stat3. Inhibition of Stat3 enhanced p-38 MAPK and NF-κβ phosphorylation and exaggerated the expression of the above markers in pediatric AVICs after TLR4 stimulation.",

This study explored the expression and underlying mechanism of WNT2 in PLNM of cervical cancer. WNT2 expression level in cervical cancer was detected using western blotting, quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Two WNT2-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were used to explore the effects of WNT2 on invasive and metastatic ability of cancer cells, and to reveal the possible mechanism of WNT2 affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The correlation between WNT2 expression and PLNM was further investigated in clinical cervical specimens. Both WNT2 mRNA and protein expression was upregulated in cervical cancer. High WNT2 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, lymphovascular space involvement, positive parametrium, and most importantly, PLNM. PLNM and WNT2 expression were independent prognostic factors for overall survival and disease-free survival. WNT2 knockdown inhibited SiHa cell motility and invasion and reversed EMT by inhibiting the WNT2/β-catenin pathway. WNT2 overexpression in cervical cancer was associated with β-catenin activation and induction of EMT, which further contributed to metastasis in cervical cancer.",

Our aim was to describe the phenotype and disease course of incident UP in a population-based study of paediatric-onset UC. All patients with UC diagnosed <17 years from 1988 to 2004, and followed during >2 years have been extracted from a population-based registry. UC location was defined according to the Paris classification. Cumulative risks for use of immunosuppressants (IS), anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) therapy, colonic extension and colectomy were described using Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors for colonic extension were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. 158 patients with paediatric-onset UC (91 females) with a median age at diagnosis of 14.5 years (Q1: 11.4-Q3: 16.1) have been identified and followed during a median of 11.4 years (8.2-15.8). Among them, 25% had UP (E1) at diagnosis and 49% of them presented a colonic extension at maximal follow-up. In these children, the cumulative risk for colonic extension was 10% at 1 year, 45% at 5 years and 52% at 10 years. No parameter at diagnosis was associated with colonic extension in the UP (E1 group). IS use was significantly lower in patients with UP than in those with E2, E3 or E4 location (p=0.049). For the UP cohort, the cumulative risk for colectomy was 3% at 1 year, 10% at 5 years, 13% at 10 years and 13% at 15 years.

The interrelationship and relative roles of fractionation and fibrotic change in AF persistence therefore remain unclear. The aim of the study was to examine the hypothesis that electrogram fractionation with increasing persistence of AF results from localized conduction slowing or block due to changes in atrial connexin distribution in the absence of fibrotic change. Of 12 goats, atrial burst pacemakers maintained AF in 9 goats for up to 3 consecutive 4-week periods. After each 4-week period, 3 goats underwent epicardial mapping studies of the right atrium and examination of the atrial myocardium for immunodetection of connexins 43 and 40 (Cx43 and Cx40) and quantification of connective tissue. Despite refractoriness returning to normal in between each 4-week period of AF, there was a cumulative increase in the prevalence of fractionated atrial electrograms during both atrial pacing (control and 1, 2, and 3 months period of AF 0.3%, 1.3% ± 1.5%, 10.6% ± 2%, and 17% ± 5%, respectively; analysis of variance, P < .05) and AF (0.3% ± 0.1%, 2.3% ± 1.2%, 14% ± 2%, and 23% ± 3%; P < .05) caused by colocalized areas of conduction block during both pacing (local conduction velocity <10 cm/s: 0.1% ± 0.1%, 0.3% ± 0.6%, 6.5% ± 3%, and 6.9% ± 4%; P < .05) and AF (1.5% ± 0.5%, 2.7% ± 1.1%, 10.1% ± 1.2%, and 13.6% ± 0.4%; P < .05), associated with an increase in the heterogeneity of Cx40 and lateralization of Cx43 (lateralization scores: 1.75 ± 0.89, 1.44 ± 0.31, 2.85 ± 0.96, and 2.94 ± 0.31; P < .02), but not associated with change in connective tissue content or net conduction velocity.",

We examined the antiproliferative action of a novel imidazoline compound S43126, and the role of the I1-imidazoline receptor, ROS, MAPKs and caspases in S43126-induced cell death. PC 12 cells were treated with various concentrations of S43126 in the presence or absence of several ligands, and the effects on cell proliferation, ROS levels, and apoptosis were evaluated using Trypan Blue, Alamar Blue, Western blot and microscopy. We showed that S43126 reduced PC12 cell proliferation by greater than 50%, increased cell death by greater than 40% and increased apoptotic body formation. These effects were reversed by I1R-antagonist, efaroxan. S43126 also increased intracellular ROS levels by greater than 2.5-fold relative to vehicle-treated control. These effects were significantly inhibited by N-acetyl-cysteine. In addition, pharmacologic inhibitors of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, significantly reduced S43126-induced antiproliferative activity.

Patients with congestive heart failure are also associated with elevated cardiac troponin and it is a very sensitive prognostic marker. However, the mechanisms of troponin elevation in patients with heart failure are not fully understood. Decompensated state itself is suggested as a factor contributing to elevated cardiac troponin-T. However comparison between invasive hemodynamic parameters and cardiac troponin-T is insufficient. Data were collected from 167 patients in stable, chronic HF, without acute coronary syndrome, recent revascularization, mitral stenoses, hemodialysis, or clinically significant right HF. We evaluated the correlations and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between invasive hemodynamic measurements and serum high-sensitivity (hs) concentrations of cTnT. The serum cTnT concentration was equal to or more than the detection threshold (0.003ng/ml) in all patients. The serum cTnT concentration was equal to or more than the cut-off value of 0.014ng/ml in 46% of patients.

Levels of pentraxin 3 were measured in individuals with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and non-psychiatric controls. Linear regression models were used to compare the pentraxin 3 levels in each of the psychiatric groups to that in the control group, adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios associated with levels of pentraxin 3 which differed from specified levels of the control group. The sample consisted of 831 individuals: 256 with bipolar disorder, 309 with schizophrenia, and 266 without a psychiatric disorder. The levels of pentraxin 3 in the bipolar disorder, but not in the schizophrenia, group were significantly lower than those of controls, adjusting for age, gender, race, maternal education, smoking status, and body mass index (t = -3.78, p < 0.001). The individuals with bipolar disorder also had significantly increased odds of having low levels of pentraxin 3 relative to both the 10th and 25th percentile level of the controls and significantly decreased odds of having a level greater than the 75th and the 90th percentile level of the controls, adjusting for the same covariates.",

In most epidemiologic studies, sleep is evaluated by self-report questionnaires but several reports suggest that these evaluations might be less accurate than objective measures such as polysomnography or actigraphy. Determinants of the discrepancy between objective and subjective measures remain to be investigated. The aim of this pilot-study was to examine the role of mood states in determining the discrepancy observed between objective and subjective measures of sleep duration in older adults. Objective sleep quantity and quality were recorded by actigraphy in a sample of 45 elderly subjects over at least three consecutive nights. Subjective sleep duration and supplementary data, such as mood status and memory, were evaluated using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). A significant discrepancy was observed between EMA and actigraphic measures of sleep duration (p < 0.001). The magnitude of this difference was explained by the patient's mood status (p = 0.020). No association was found between the magnitude of this discrepancy and age, sex, sleep quality or memory performance.",

The aim of the study is to assess the levels of fasting and post-prandial GLP-1 and their risk for T2DM. A case control study was conducted at the diabetes clinic Sanglah Hospital Denpasar Bali, involving 40 subjects who were native Indonesian citizens and 18-70 years of age. Twenty subjects were allocated as the case group (subjects with T2DM) and 20 subjects were allocated as the control group (subjects with normal glucose tolerance [NGT]). Both fasting intact GLP-1 (FGLP-1) and 60 minutes post-75 gram glucose loading intact GLP-1 (1hGLP-1) levels were measured. Both fasting and post-prandial GLP-1 levels were significantly lower in subjects with T2DM than those with NGT (2.06 ± 0.43 vs. 2.87 ± 0.67 pg/L, p < 0.01; and 2.49 ± 0.60 vs. 3.42 ± 0.85 pg/L, p = 0.02; respectively). Low levels of FGLP-1 (OR, 13.5; p = 0.001) and 1hGLP-1 (OR, 5.667, p = 0.018), with no response after glucose loading (∆GLP-1), were a significant risk for T2DM.

In the developing brain, the widespread neuron apoptosis triggered by ketamine has been demonstrated. However, little is known about its effect on neural stem cells (NSCs) function. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ketamine on proliferation of NSCs from neonatal rat hippocampus. Neural stem cells were isolated from the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats on postnatal day 3. In dose-response experiments, cultured neural stem cells (NSCs) were exposed to different concentrations of ketamine (0-1000 µM) for 24 hrs. The proliferative activity of NSCs was evaluated by 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Apoptosis of neural stem cells were assessed using caspase-3 by western blot. The intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) in NSCs was analyzed by flow cytometry. The activation of protein kinase C-α (PKCα) and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) were measured by western blot analysis. Clinical relevant concentration of ketamine (10, 20 and 50 µM) did not markedly alter the proliferation of NSCs from neonatal rat hippocampus in vitro. However, ketamine (200, 500, 800 and 1000μM) significantly inhibited the proliferation of NSCs and did not affect the expression of caspase-3. Meanwhile, ketamine (200, 500, 800 and 1000μM) also markedly decreased [Ca(2+)]i as well as suppressed PKCα activation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in NSCs. A combination of subthreshold concentrations of ketamine (100 μM) and Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil (2.5 μM), PKCα inhibitor chelerythrine (2.5 μM) or ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor PD98059 (5 μM) significantly produced suprathreshold effects on PKCα activation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NSC proliferation.",

It has been reported that abnormal fibrin probably contributes to the incomplete resolution of emboli. And there is evidence that free iron could convert fibrinogen into fibrin which is remarkably resistant to lysis. Thus, we hypothesized that persistent iron overload might participate in the development of CTEPH. A case-control study was conducted. Forty-five CTEPH patients were enrolled as cases, and 36 age and sex frequency-matched chronic PE patients without pulmonary hypertension were selected as controls. Levels of free iron, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), ferritin, sTfR/ferritin ratio, hepcidin-25, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to estimate odds ratios. There was no difference of the levels of free iron, hepcidin-25, sTfR, ferritin, sTfR/ferritin ratio, TNF-α, and MDA between CTEPH patients and the controls. Levels of sTfR and ferritin in both groups were within the normal limits. Levels of IL-6 in CTEPH patients were significantly higher than that in the controls. A negative correlation was observed between hepcidin-25 and sTfR (Spearman's r=-0.438, P<.001), and a positive correlation was observed between hepcidin-25 and ferritin (Spearman's r=0.503, P<.001). In the univariate logistic regression model, there was no association observed between CTEPH and free iron, hepcidin-25, sTfR, ferritin, sTfR/ferritin ratio, TNF-α, IL-6, and MDA.",

There is limited knowledge related to readmissions after esophagectomy for malignancy. Our aim was to determine the impact on survival of readmission after esophagectomy. This cohort study utilizes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data (2002 to 2009). Survival, length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and discharge disposition were determined. Multivariate logistic regression models were created to examine risk factors associated with readmission. In all, 1,744 patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy: 80% of patients (1,390) were male, and mean age was 73 years; 71.8% of tumors (1,251) were adenocarcinomas, and 72.5% (1,265) were distal esophageal tumors; 38% of patients (667) received induction therapy. Operative approach was transthoracic in 52.6% of patients (918) and transhiatal in 37.4% (653), and required complex reconstruction (intestinal interposition) in 9.9% (173). Stage distribution was as follows: stage I, 35.3% (616); stage II, 32.5% (566); stage III, 27.9% (487); and stage IV, 2.3% (40). Median length of stay was 13 days, hospital mortality was 9.3% (158 patients), and 30-day readmission rate was 18.6% (212 of 1,139 home discharges); 25.4% of patients (443) were discharged to institutional care facilities.

A prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled study. A single tertiary cardiac center. One hundred consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and patients provided informed consent to participate. Patients were randomized by computer into 2 equal groups: Vasopressin or control. The blinded study included vasopressin administered at a dose of 1.8 U/h or 1.8 mL/h of normal saline, along with catecholamines. The drug was administered continually during surgery while patients needed catecholamines. The intervention was discontinued upon admission to the intensive care unit when information regarding the true character of the drug was reported to the doctor in charge of patients in the intensive care unit by one of the investigators. Primary outcomes were CK-MB and troponin T levels measured at 0, 6, and 12 hours postoperatively.

However, 24-hour in-hospital congenital cardiac surgical coverage (24-CCSC) is not available at all institutions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of 24-CCSC on perioperative ECMO outcomes in CHS patients. An institutional review board approved, retrospective review of 128 perioperative CHS ECMO patients at a single, quaternary care children's hospital between January 2003 and December 2012 was performed. Primary endpoints evaluated were mortality in children supported with ECMO after undergoing cardiac surgery and ECMO-related morbidity after initiation of 24-CCSC with advanced congenital cardiac surgical fellows. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether 24-CCSC was absent (cohort 1: January 2003 to July 2007) or present (cohort 2: August 2007 to December 2012) at the time of ECMO management. The surgical procedures performed were similar in both cohorts based on STAT Mortality Categories (5 Society of Thoracic Surgeons-European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Categories). The overall mortality rate in children supported with ECMO after undergoing cardiac surgery was 53%. This mortality was significantly reduced from 68% to 43% (p = 0.007) with 24-CCSC. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that 24-CCSC (p = 0.009) and lower STAT Mortality Category (p = 0.042) were independent predictors of operative survival. Cardiac arrhythmias (36% to 16%; p = 0.012) and pulmonary complications (32% to 8%; p < 0.001) were significantly reduced with 24-CCSC.",

In this study, it was aimed to create an algorithm for the reconstruction of lateral scalp alopecias with the goal to achieve better and standardized results. Lateral scalp alopecias were divided into three groups: total lateral alopecia (type I), temporal and sideburn alopecia (type II), and sideburn alopecia (type III). Tissue expanders were placed at the parieto-occipital area in type I defects, parietal area in type II defects, and the temporal region in type III defects. Tissue expanders were used to create flaps that were advanced with 60° rotation, 90° rotation, and no rotation for type I, II, and III defects, respectively.

However, studies to clarify factors predictive of histological change in patients with NASH remain scarce. Our aim is to determine predictors of histological progression in Japanese patients with biopsy-proven NASH. This retrospective cohort study enrolled 52 patients with NASH who underwent serial liver biopsies. Histological evaluation included NAFLD activity score (NAS) and liver fibrosis. The median interval between initial and second liver biopsies was 968 days. An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) response was defined as a decrease of 30% or more from baseline. Of 52 patients, NAS was ameliorated in 30.8%, deteriorated in 30.8% and remained unchanged in 38.4%. Liver fibrosis was improved in 25.0% of patients, progressed in 25.0% and remained stable in 50.0%. Multivariate analysis identified ALT non-response as a predictor of deterioration of NAS (hazard ratio [HR], 5.85; P = 0.031) and progression of liver fibrosis (HR, 4.50; P = 0.029).

Lep(ob/ob) mice (OB) with targeted Nrf2 deletion (OB-Nrf2KO) were generated. Pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes was measured in C57BL/6J, Nrf2KO, OB, and OB-Nrf2KO mice. Hepatic lipid content, lipid clearance, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion were determined between OB and OB-Nrf2KO mice. OB-Nrf2KO mice exhibited decreased white adipose tissue mass and decreased adipogenic and lipogenic gene expression compared with OB mice. Nrf2 deficiency prolonged hyperglycemia in response to glucose challenge, which was paralleled by reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. In OB mice, Nrf2 deficiency decreased hepatic lipid accumulation, decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) content, and enhanced VLDL secretion. However, this observation was opposite in lean mice.

We performed a meta-analysis to comparing prognosis and safety between perioperative chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy to identify the better chemotherapy option for gastric cancer. We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Ovid databases for eligible studies until February 2016. The main endpoints were prognostic value (hazard ratio [HR] for overall survival [OS] and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate), response rate of chemotherapy, radical resection rate, post-operative complication rate, and adverse effects of chemotherapy. Five randomized controlled trials and six clinical controlled trials involving 1,240 patients were eligible for analysis. Compared with the adjuvant chemotherapy group, the perioperative chemotherapy group had significantly better prognosis (HR, 0.74; 95 % CI, 0.61 to 0.89; P < 0.01).
